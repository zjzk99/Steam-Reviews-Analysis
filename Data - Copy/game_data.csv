This game lost it's Overwhelmingly Positive rating simply because they didn't manage to translate all of the 80,000 or so lines of dialogue in time for the release. Seriously.  EDIT: To everyone asking, the game is FULLY voice acted, every NPC, no matter how insignificant has a voice. That is somewhere in the area of 80,000 voices lines, where a lot had to be recorded 8 times for each one of the player voices."
1,Rojigami,214,690,17,"October 25, 2017",Recommended,237.1,"This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!  Great work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!"
2,Lost Sinner,79,518,12,"August 15, 2017",Recommended,"2,780.1","‚ô¶ One of the best cRPG out there, if you are a fan of roleplaying games, this is definitely a must buy. For those who never play thier first game, no worries, although they take places in a same universe, each has a standalone story. This one starts thousand years after the first one so you are not missing anything.  ‚ô¶ One of best thing about DOS 2 is it gameplay. It's turn-based, slow-paced but really interactive with many different elemental combinations, cool interactions between each abilities and your surrounding environmental even statuses are interesting.   For some examples you can create some nasty chain explosive reactions with a combo of Fire and Poison, any kind of liquid (water/blood/poison/...) left on the battleground can reacted to Air turning it into a pool of Electricity deal damage and stun anyone in it.    Buffs/debuffs status usually do more than one thing and may interact with eachother, Stone Armor not only increase your physical armor but also stop you from bleeding/burning because you are solid rock. Peace Of Mind is the kind of ability that let you see a bigger pictures, it provides stats buff and cure Blindness BUT also remove frenzy status Rage, because the target have become more wise so no more bold actions. Rage on the otherhand is also another status which increase damage output but at a great cost of defense down.   Surrounding environmental also plays a great part in your game, say if someone go invisible and there is happen to be raining, that sneaky guy will be revealed because he's wet. And because water react violently with electricity, he will be taking increased Air damage but will take less damage if you throw a fireball at him. Walking through frozen ground and you may trip and get knocked down. Standing on high ground will make your spells/abilities/items reach further with increased damage. ‚ô¶ Talents in game open up your playstyles depend on what you pick. Lone Wolf or One Man Army does what it says for who want to go solo, Leech turn you into a vampire allowing you to heal when standing near blood or Zombie make Poison heal you instead but normal healing will damage you. Because the game is classless , you can be anyone , mix and match anything you like, you may be born a warrior but dream to be a mage, go learn some magic and become a battlemage. Who says warrior can't be sneaky, go ahead and get yourself some rogue abilities...  ‚ô¶ Divinity Original Sin 2 also offer you really great roleplaying experience, it has a great balance between combat and talking with rich dialogues and occasional silly humors. You can play as different races: Human , Elf , Dwarf , Undead and Lizard..yeah thats' right, you can become a Lizard that spits out Fire. Each races have different racial skill and special power, NPCs may also react/talk differently to you depend on your race. There are also different original characters ingame who have thier own story, goals and personalites for you to play, but if you want to create your own character, the game also offer many different origins which called tags: Soldier, Scholar, Outlaw,..etc which plays a part in dialogue. The Origins will remain in your game as companion and you can have different perspective on them through dialogues/questline which is really cool imo,  there is also a relationship system ingame (not fully included in EA , will be in full game) which can create intense rivalry, friendship, enmity and romance!  ‚ô¶ Visually, the game looks great, it's colorful most of the times and can be dark when needed to be, infact the DOS 2 is meant to be darker and much more focused than the previous one. Having finished Act 1 in EA, there are no fetch quests and unrelated to the storyline, all of them is connected one way or another, each tell you a story about the game's world and ultimately leading to a bigger picture. You can finish quests in different ways , any path is a progression, you'll never feel getting stuck, there are always different paths to take, things to do. Oh a maze, i'm not in the mood to solve puzzle atm, let's jump/fly through it, dont have wings? Look around, there's maybe some other hidden paths/shortcut or go do some questline maybe some of them will shed some lights of the Maze making it easier to go through.  ‚ô¶ Crafting is in game (duh..! obviously, it's an cprg game) and it's RICH. Just look up the crafting list in DOS 1, and  before there were just a combination of two items, in DOS 2 you can have a combination of total 5 items. Here comes the great part, you can craft new skills by combining books of different schools. You can turn a normal rain into a mean blood storm. Mixing a Pryo spell with Necromancy, you can make corpses explode dealing massive damage to nearby targets as if you cutting thier buddies down wasn't enough..  ‚ô¶ There are alot more cool features ingame but i won't include them all in this small review. So i'll add one more thing that may get some people excited: There will be a Game Master Mode! which have up to 5 players in total which include 4 main players and 1 GM. Allowing you to create your own worlds and adventure with friends, the devs also offer alot of tools for easier time making your own dungeon, you can control anything, the stats, the weather, music, dialouges, events,..etc and you can even do it on the fly! You can take a quick look of the mode here (a GM Mode game hosted by Matt Mercer)  ‚ô¶ If you are interested in some gameplays, feel free to check my videos: Honour Mode Walkthrough "
3,Wren,380,272,9,January 4,Recommended,100.6,"Mind = Blown Divinity: Original Sin 2 is easily my top game of 2017, and probably up there in my list of most favorite games of all time. My mind was completely blown every step of the way through this fantastic journey, start to finish.   Positives+ You do ùòØùò∞ùòµ need to play its predecessor to understand what's going on in this title. + That voice acting. Every line. Every banter. Even the narration when nothing needs to be said between characters. It's fantastic. + A beautifully detailed, living world. You can see how much love and work when into this. So much to explore, so much to see. So many little secrets tucked away here and there. Not to mention while in combat, every single turn needs to be thought out depending on the enviroment around you.  + The assortment of items, weapons and armor is definitely not lacking.  + The ability to freely make your own ""class"" for yourself and your companions. Mix and match whatever skills you want. Whatever suits your playstyle. If you want a Skeleton guy to be your main healer with Necromancy, then do it! + I finished the game on the easiest difficulty in about 85-90 hours, give or take. And that's without finishing all the side quests or companion quests. The amount of content stuffed into this game will leave you plenty to do. + Co-op. Yes. You can play the entire game start to finish with a friend, with a few friends, with strangers. It doesn't matter.  + Dungeon Master mode. Does creating entire campaigns like Dungeons and Dragons appeal to you? Then heck yes! I never really took much time to dabble in it, but I can see the appeal to it. + Replayability. This is huge for me. So many choices that will leave you wondering ""what if I had done this differently?""   Negatives- It's been a fair bit since I played, but I had an issue finishing a companion quest that was tied into the same NPC as another companion I had. Once completed, one companion was stuck and could not progress. I ended up finishing the game without completing it. - A few bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking. Most notably in ""The Arx"". There was one house with locked doors in which you could run right through them. - I noticed here and there a fair bit of an FPS drop in combat when my screen is exploding with spell effects.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is unforgiving, doesn't coddle and definitely doesn't hold your hand, but taking the time to learn the combat system and all the little bits and pieces is worth every penny from your wallet and every second of your time."
4,ProfessorButts,111,489,9,"June 5, 2017",Recommended,165.6,"You will love this game if... - You like games that don't hold your hand - You like games that allow you freedom to customise your characters and experiences - You like games that TRULY reward exploration and investigation *Legit, if you don't sit there scrolling over the map looking for hidden chests, ladders, ledges, etc, you're doing it wrong* - You like high strategy, turn based combat that rewards forward thinking and planning - You like finding, using, selling or collecting loot - You have 1 or more friends that will play with you. This game shines in multiplayer  The handful of little annoying bugs and glitches are completely and utterly outweighed by how captivating and enthralling this game is... And it's still in Early Access... I see a lot of complaints that the story isn't long enough, or really focusing on the bugs, lets get real.  Bugs: - Sometimes your helmet will blink and flicker a bit - Sometimes your characters won't be within range, or have line of sight on a target they clearly should - Accuracy percentage seems to be a bit off, 80% chance to hit is more like 30%; anything under 90% is trouble That's... About it...  Story is too short? Well then play the rest of the game kid. You can speed run the ""story"" in like 20 minutes if you wanted, the real fun comes from exploring the world and finding everything else there is to do. I honestly can't believe how good this game is for an EA release and I can't wait for the full release come September. Could not recommend highly enough.  Things I would like to see in future: - More races. - More in depth customisation options for spells and abilities. Think Champions Online or the Oblivion Spell-Creation. (asking for a lot, I know) - A little control over what armour looks like on your character.  - More spells, more synergy between spells. This is already great, but why stop at great! The more points I list, the more I realise I'm just asking for more of the game. Give me more of the game mate."
5,Purrmaid,650,401,5,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,149.3,"It seems I've never written a review for D:OS2, and with the Steam Awards wanting us to update a review, I might as well!  Let me start by stating that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is my all time favorite game. I adored the first one. I'm worshippping the second.  This isn't a game that'll hold your hand, this isn't a game that's easy and laid back. This is the game that throws you in the middle of a world and tells you to figure it out.   It has multiple difficulty settings, so if tactical turnbased combat isn't your strongest suit there ARE easier modes for you! But the harsh combat isn't the only thing that makes this game hard. It's the quests, the world, there is NO handholding. You got to figure out what to do, you got to figure out which quest to solve and focus on. And boy are there many quests to focus on!  Some seem absolutely random, some seem like just a typical sidequest kind of job that ends up being the key ingredient in solving the big mystery! I love that, I love that the first act has you stuck on an island, a jail, and your job is to break out. And how would one do this? There isn't just one way, or two, or three. There are more than that. Way more. And it's up to you to figure out the way.   There are five races, human, dwarf, elf, lizard, and undead. Each brings with their own talents and experience in the game. You might have trouble with certain quests because they hate your race, you might need to find another way into a town because they don't like dwarves. It's extremely immersive, and playing it as a coop makes it even so.   I'm not sure I have words to describe to you how amazing this game is. I like difficult games, I played this on Tactical, which is hard, and on some boss fights me and my coop partner would sit here for two hours. Reloading. Repositioning. Changing skills. Reloading. over and over untill we finally managed to beat said boss. It was one of the most amazing experiences I've had in gaming all year. Just that little bit of having to figure out how something works.  There are Character Tags and Talents that you can choose that really makes this into an immersive rpg. Pet Pal allows you to talk to animals. That sad dog over there, cheer him up and he'll help you. That nasty fire elemental? Guess what! She needs your help! You can have a talent that makes you stink, and people dislike you because of it.   Larian Studios is a dev team to follow. I cannot wait to see what comes next. (Voice acting wasn't in the original budget. There was partial voice acting, but somehow they managed to make the entire game voice acted, without starting another kickstarter and without pushing the game back a few months. It was a surprise untill launch and I give them major props for doing this)"
6,PixelGrotto,150,144,39,March 2,Recommended,136.9,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is like playing a very enthusiastic Dungeon Master's homebrew campaign. Said DM really fell in love with the cosmology and deities section of the Dungeon Master's Guide as well as the idea of creating an epic, REALLY LONG arc where his players eventually achieve godhood. Mr. DM also put an awful lot of time into fleshing out his world and making sure you know that HIS elves are DIFFERENT (they EAT people and get their MEMORIES, see), though for some reason he decided to keep his dwarves Scottish.  This DM is not perfect and has his faults. For one, he really loves throwing environmental effects all over the battlefield to the point of it becoming annoying. Fire spreads 50 feet in an arc! Now ice shoots out over the fire! Now smoke and lighting and tentacles spread atop the fire and ice! Yeah! Near the end of the campaign, his planning starts to slip, both in combat design and in lore. For instance, he offers his players a variety of different endings to their grand adventure, but none of them are all that great, and one gets the feeling that he randomly chose the final boss by just flipping through the Monster Manual with the intent of picking a Challenge Rating 30 beastie just to tell his other DM friends that ""I PUT MY PLAYERS UP AGAINST THIS GUY ONCE AND THEY KIND OF SURVIVED!""   After playing for nearly 140 hours, though, none of his players can say it wasn't an epic time at the table. They'll probably be back for more.  BTW, Mr. DM - Lohse was the best character you created."
7,Genky,186,175,0,"February 5, 2017",Recommended,131.4,"What can I say ... This is Belgium's jewel in the gaming industry. The kind of game developer we need more of.  More content, more polished and more fun than any triple A game developer will give you, at 2/3 the price and no hundreds of holes to add paid content later. Even in the Early Access phase this is already more polished than most games are 3 months after official launch.  The game itself: It's the original + improved and better in every single way. Graphics look great and the engine is very well optimized (already). The combat and progression system is very well done and fun. Multiplayer even better integrated than the original. Storyline and characters are interesting and well written. The music, I absolutely love it. Affordable.  Even if you fear the Early Access tag, just buy this if you're into this type of games at all, you won't be disappointed and you'll actually be supporting a developer that delivers and makes games for the gamers, not for mass revenue. (Of course they're a business in it for profit too, but there's a difference between 45 euro for a full game and 60 euro for a game with 10 strategically placed holes for paid DLC, pushed into release with game breaking bugs. Larian Studios actually ditched their publisher and switched to crowd funding because they forced them to make and launch the game the way they didn't want it, that should tell you enough.)  Larian Studios, as a Belgian, I can say you make us proud. Please keep doing what you're doing, never succumb to the attitude most major developers and publishers have, it'd be a huge loss in the game industry."
8,VAC in time by Hubert Lewis,229,395,24,January 22,Recommended,49.9,Blah blah blah best RPG literally of the past 10 years blah blah blah.  Here's What Matters. You can literally do anything and the game is prepared for all of it. Pay Full Price. Games like this don't happen enough.
9,Surplus Cyborg,103,"1,001","1,540","November 16, 2017",Recommended,91.6,Talked to a chicken that claimed he was a mighty wizard. Called him a liar. The chicken teleported me to the other side of the continent. Had to walk back to the rest of my party. Serves me right for doubting the mighty magic chicken. This game is awsome.
10,Zorao,340,242,5,"November 4, 2017",Recommended,80.6,"This game is a masterpiece. Easily one of the best games I ever played in my life.   The gear is very rewarding, you notice your characters actually develop and become way stronger with each level and each new gear equipment.   The story is rich and the voice acting makes it really helpful if you don't like reading dialogues. You can play the game multiple times and you would have a different experience each time you play it.   Try to get some friends to play with you, they can either help you or turn against you. For example your friend could tell the guards that you stole something and they will put you in jail!. or you can make your friend distract traders and you pickpocket them.   I really recommend this game."
11,Zahbuhdoo,459,269,2,"September 20, 2017",Recommended,178.7,"If you like turn-based RPG's with lots of customization and a good story to put along with them, do yourself a favor and buy this game. This game will leave you wanting more every time you put it down. Choices matter. Characters are interesting. Combat is fluid. This is one of the better, if not best, Turn-Based RPG's out there.   Side Note: Larian Studios has shown how much they care about the content they put out by giving you the best they can offer. Did you notice the price tag isn't $60? Did you notice the Divine Edition is only $15 but not at all game-changing or content locking from the base game? Did you notice the Game Master Mode wasn't a purchasable DLC? That is humility right there. They aren't trying to squeeze every last person for some money. They are looking to create quality content so that we can enjoy it at, for what you're buying, an extremely generous price. They knew the fan-base and what people wanted and how bad they wanted it. They still did not take advantage of us. Larian Studios has earned my undying support."
12,Dracknov,153,518,7,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,271.9,"I was tired of games that only tests your reaction skill. I was tired of games that say it's 60 dollars, only to have randomized loot boxes or micro-transaction implemented later in time. I was tired of games that were advertised to be wide as an ocean but ended up being shallow like a puddle.   Then Divinity Original Sin 2 came out. Each encounter is well executed and designed flawlessly. Enemy design  is varied and leaves my friend and I saying ""WTF is that!?"" often. Every time my friend finds some epic loot, we cannot wait to identify it to see who can make use of the item. Quests are a joy to do and often leads you to find more quests that's filled with important decision making. Every choice you make has an impact on the world and I have been sent to jail multiple times for making the wrong decision. For $44.99 you are not buying a game but an experience. An experience to truly go on an epic adventure. Fights are never easy but once you learn the satisfaction of besting the enemy combatant that you failed to take down multiple times, you are left leaving for more glory. (Currently playing on Tactician Mode)   I am not sure if anyone is going to read this review since this is my very first review with a positive rating (My other review is for Fallout 4 CREATION CLUB so you already know what rating I gave) but if you are looking for a game with challenge, depth, and quality give this game a try. I have been playing this game for over 102 hours and I have a feeling that this is only the beginning."
13,[49th]TheProTaco,173,227,11,"August 17, 2017",Recommended,140.1,"It's finally out!   Absolutely phenomenal, 10/10.  I don't go a single moment in this game without being mesmerized by how fantastic it is.  I'll list some pros:  -Beautiful art style, everything looks amazing.  -Combat that is both simple and incredibly difficult at the same time. After two-to-three encounters the player will have a good grasp of how combat works, but throughout the entire game they'll be learning new ways to manipulate the environment and their abilities to play better.  -Fantastic writing, honestly amazing.  -Perfect soundtrack, every sound and song in this game is so perfectly adjusted for the situation it's seamless and very immersive.  -Highly addictive, once I sit down to play I'm practically rooted to my chair to continue.  -Companions you'll care about, it's the tragedy of lesser RPGs that your companions are boring and lifeless, but here, everyone has their own ambitions and goals, and WILL pursue them.    There's very little wrong about this game. Previously I mentioned that voice acting won't be included which would be a con to some, but in a complete surprise Larian have voiced the entire game, despite the fact that was never planned throughout development.  Highly recommend purchasing it, you really can't go wrong on this purchase."

Made by Larian Studios, it was able to level with AAA games that it even surpasses the standards, regardless of its flaws.  You'll play as your own character in the story, and embark on a journey towards the world of Rivellon as you find the answer to the cause of the Void's awakening. You could also play as one of the six main characters with their own unique story if character creation is not your thing.  Also, quicksaving before doing anything else is a must. Talk to someone, quicksave first. Interacting an item, quicksave first. Opening a door, quicksave. After an autosave, quicksave.  REVIEW The game is very similar to its previous title, Divinity: Original Sin (DOS1). There may be changes, but there's nothing too drastic as far as I've observed.   STORYDOS2 moved towards a more interesting Plot. While it still does have DOS1's lighthearted ""HaHa""s, the studio was able to put the humor at the right spot. In a way, they're able to make a decently captivating tale for an RPG. What's so interesting about the plot's flow is that the game doesn't make you feel like you need to save the world because when you want to go somewhere, doing so will progress your main story. The linearity is barely present that I didn't even know which quest I should keep my focus on my first playthrough.   It's quite unfortunate, for me at least, how the game treats the Party Interaction on the whole story as it progresses because it had less... interaction. Back in DOS1's party interaction, you're able to choose a dialogue for everyone. DOS2 removed that feature and only allows you to choose a dialogue for your main character only; however, in turn they added an Attitude system, so your party members and everyone else in the game have their own morals and beliefs. In the end, it sadly lowers the replayability. GAMEPLAYOn the matter of the game's Quest System, I become lost throughout my first playthrough. Given that most of your progress relates to the main story, a quest that I've ignored for an in-game day (since I'm focusing on a particular quest at that time) suddenly updates along with the quest I'm currently taking. There are some cases during an update to my current quest, a new quest opens up in my journal. In a long run, the quest log became flooded to a point that I don't know which quest would I continue.  The turn-based Combat System is really great. Given how there's hundreds of skills and hardly countable ways of killing an enemy, the fact that good positioning actually gives an advantage, it's hard to get bored of it. Unlike many turn-based games, the Original Sin series shines on how your surroundings affect you and your enemy's strategy. The lit torch stand, the oil puddle poured near an explosive barrel, the sea shore, everything is interactive. In DOS2, the height advantage was a great addition.  The game's Challenge is the one that sparks its replayability. It's not just how unfair some items/skills are, it's the moment when the AI actually knows how, where, and when to use the environment and situation to their advantage. Once you've come up with a different build, their playstyle changes. They are annoyingly smart that sometimes they're three turns ahead of you if you're not aware enough.  Carelessly set a trap mine near an enemy, one of them will then teleport you on top of it. Enemies even face behind a wall just so your Rogue character can't backstab him/her. Although, there is a time when a hazardous area is too wide, the AI keeps on walking around the said area until they die instead of just standing still. It has its awful moments sadly. AESTHETICSComparing the two of the series, DOS2 was able to utilize more graphical features which made it far more detailed than DOS1. It shifted from a cartoony colorful vibe into a more realistic and bleak environment. Even so, the Graphics were decent at best.   The Music score is an improvement from the previous title. Just comparing the two themes, you could say that they have more budget this time haha. It's interesting how you could select your character's instrument theme, so you could hear a particular instrument on certain occasions depending on what you chose for one of your characters. As much as how catchiness goes however, it's not as grand as what I always hear from Bioware and Bethesda games. For short, DOS2's music is ingenuinely good.  Sample OST I personally liked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxuC0i5S_LE For a game that lacks flashy CGI cinematics, they were able to compensate it with the expressive Voice Dialogues. You've gotta hand it to the voice actors and scriptwriters for making their characters and npcs feel alive. It's interesting how most of them have something to say inside and outside of the conversation. FEATURESFor a turn-based game, the Playability is good. Besides the 4 player multiplayer, there's couch co-op and controller support. The game is playable in any way but 3-4 splitscreen multiplayer, yet it's still rare to find such accessibility this time around in video games.  Game Master Mode is a cool feature that you can't believe it's included on the standard game. Though, I'm not fond of Dungeons and Dragons, it really seems that's what it's trying to make out of this game mode. In my case, this is a casual DnD that includes the game's character abilities and such. An interesting mode to say the least.  Arena Mode is a decent feature if you're up for some PvP duels. Besides the fact that you could play online, there's an offline mode called Hot Seat where you and your fellow players play in one device.  Lastly, this game has the Classic Edition (CE) which removes tons of new dialogues and enemy encounters along with the updated User Interface for controller users from the Definitive Edition.

As a longtime fan of RPGs, this is not just the greatest RPG I've ever played, it is in the running for the best single player experience I have ever had on PC.  Everything you do seems to have a meaningful impact on everything you will do next. After 30 hours of gameplay I had to stop reloading quick saves and accept my decisions... Divinity 2 rarely presents you with black and white moral choices, and a simple slip of the tongue will see you losing loved ones fast.  The combat is challenging, in a good way. It allows you to customize your party completely and make logical and creative decisions in combat that you don't really expect to work but then they totally have an effect you weren't expecting....  ...that is why this game is perfection. Every time I pushed at the borders of the game to see if I could get away with something, I realised the border wasn't there... so I pushed harder and got more creative...  I have a man who can speak to Animals and I highly suggest you take the Perk that allows this ASAP in game because it opens up a huge depth to storyline. I now treat Chickens and Squirrels with the same respect as I do any other NPC. I speak to the ghosts of the dead and they present me with A LOT of moral decisions.   How far will you spin your moral compass to become Godly powerful? Who will you grow close to only to realise that at any moment they might stab you in the back or even worse... that you will have to choose to lose for the sake of the greater good?  14/10 would sneak a peek at Lizard Royalty having sex in a caravan again x"
18,Bee,131,104,9,June 24,Recommended,436.2,"After hitting over 400 hours in Divinity: Original Sin 2, I feel like I can finally review it in full depth.  The game is spectacular. It was everything I wanted from Original Sin and then more.   The quests are in-depth, and you feel the consequences of your character/race choices on top of the dialogue you pick. I've played four full playthroughs, and each one I was still finding things I had missed (and I'm sure I will find more in my next one). The story is just fantastic, I couldn't ask for more from a storyline. The game makes you want to read every little lore book and just learn more and more about anything and everything going on. And if you're an Original Sin fan, there's little pieces of lore left around everywhere for you to prick your ears up at and get excited about (and then some!).   Then there's the combat. It's fantastic. It's incredibly strategic in every aspect. Your first playthrough on Tactician will give you some good laughs at some of the difficulty you need to face and work around (this is a good thing! My boyfriend and I faced some extremely hilarious moments of trying to figure out a fight and failing miserably when we were learning the game, it was amazing fun). And then you enter the realm of searching out perfect gear, perfect min-maxing, perfect stats, and perfect combat. That, in itself, is the most enjoyable aspect of the combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2. You can hop from easier combat to the most intense combat the game offers, and it's all fun. I recently finished my solo Honour Mode, and it was definitely hard and an adventure and left me sitting during quite a few fights thinking out beforehand how I was going to handle them because even the smallest mistake can mess you up. I can go on and on about how amazing the combat is, but you really just need to delve into it yourself to truly see how remarkable it is. I can't find anything I enjoy as much as D:OS2's combat system anywhere else.  If you're looking for a game to literally lose yourself in for long periods of time, or to even play casually in your free time, this is definitely my go-to. This is just a masterpiece of a game, it's every fantasy and rpg player's dream come true. And did I mention the co-op is incredibly fun? Really, it's just a stunning piece of art.  Now, I have a great many pros for D:OS2, but I do have a few cons, and these are entirely subjective, and my own personal opinion.  I really don't enjoy the four-man party system. For someone like me, it's way too overwhelming managing four characters at all times, and I just don't like it. Because some best in slot gear pieces are unique and you won't find ANYTHING else with their bonuses on in the game (Second Skin, ihu), you're just sacrificing too much playing a full four-man. But that's from a min-maxing perspective, and probably not that important to others. The second part of why I don't like the four-man parties is because once you get a taste of the solid power of a Lone Wolf character, you really can't ever go back. Now this can be a good or bad thing. It gives the game a lot of replayable value, I'm about to hit my 5th playthrough and I'm finally needing to stray away from my babe Sebille ( ): ), which pushes me to pick other players to experience their stories.   With all that being said, this is definitely a game I recommend anyone to buy. It's amazing in every aspect. I absolutely cannot wait until the Definitive Edition either. And big, big props to Larian Studios for their choice to give the buyers of D:OS2 the Definitive Edition for free. Incredible company who listens to their audience. I can't wait to see what future games come!"

20,Zant,142,139,15,June 3,Recommended,175.7,"I cannot recommend this game enough. It is an RPG that breaks the boundaries of what you perceive an RPG to be. Every problem or puzzle has what feels like more solutions than you can conceive of. Original Sin 2 rewards clever thinking, tactics, and the role-playing itself over all else. Stat building and creating the ""perfect character"" is always a fun aspect of CRPGs but I'd say it's not the main focus here. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of numbers and plenty to min-max, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much damage you do if you're not in combat, and the game truly shines when you can avoid it.  Don't get me wrong, the combat in this game is fantastic. You can control all of your (up to 4) party members individually outside of combat and prepare the upcoming battlefield to your liking assuming you have the drop on your opponents. Place your archers up top, give your wizards ample space, have clean terrain for your warriors, e.t.c. However, when you find yourself able to circumvent combat, you'll be rewarded with a level of satisfaction very rare in games these days.  It constantly feels like Original Sin 2 almost dares you to break the game's boundaries. It challenges you to out-think the developers. Everything matters in this game. I'll leave you with an anecdote:  As I explored, searching for a quest target, I came upon a ruin. I saw a passage through, but in between it and myself were a few foes I was most certainly not equipped to handle at my current level. In other games I'd probably have left and came back later when I was a higher level, but not here. I navigated around the edges of the NPCs' detection radius in stealth with each of my characters individually until I found a minuscule spot I could teleport to that would get me past my foes. It was certainly inconvenient, but it worked - I painstakingly teleported each of my characters in turn to that one spot only to realize the one doing the teleporting was stuck below; the one casting the spell is unable to use it on themselves. After some hard thought I realized I could place the teleportation artifact close enough for my previously transported characters to grab. I then used it to pull my last hero past the baddies. I exhaled a sigh of relief and then panned the camera to see I had just come face-to-face with the very character I had been trying to track down. I was positively oozing with smugness."

26,saturn missiles,183,253,2,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,341.5,"Simply put, Divinity: Original Sin 2 expands on the best ideas from the first game while taking a complete 180 in tone to deliver a much darker and adult experience compared to the first.  One of the most notable changes is immediately realized as character creation begins, with races, tags, origin stories, and a complete stat revamp giving a new level of depth to character creation. The origin story presets, while not customizable, deliver a unique experience for each. All of the notable ""origin story"" characters have interactions with each other, and even if you choose not to create them yourself, they can be found and interacted with around the world. Not only this, but you can recruit these important figures of the lore. Origin stories on the surface level seem gimmicky, but allow for a whole new level of replayability, in combination with the tag system. The tag system allows you to acquire new tags that effect quests and dialogue as you progress through the game, or assign them to your custom character in character creation. ""Origin story"" characters will have these tags preset, as well as a brief synopsis of their lore.   However, the changes aren't just to the character creation. As soon as you get into combat, you'll quickly notice how much has changed. While Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps the basics of the first game intact, action points have recieved a complete overhaul, streamlining the process of choosing actions. While the new system (6 action points total; 4 action points at the start of encounter. Most skills cost 1-2 action points) may seem to cater to a more casual audience at first, the new skills that accompany this revamp allow for a level of complexity in combat never before seen in the Divinity series. New skills introduced in the second game are more ambitious, creative, and innovative than any in the first game. Even from the start of the game, you'll acquire interesting abilities that you can use to control the battlefield. The new targeting system provided in D:OS2 gives a sense of clarity lacking in the first game. Height advantages and disadvantages means that positioning matters now more than ever before. In addition to the ""surfaces"" system of the first game (fire, poison, poison clouds, static clouds, electrified water, etc), most of these surfaces can now be blessed and cursed for interesting variations and choice in combat. For example, while fire is harmful to your team, if you bless it, it'll apply a heal every turn and prevent the members within from being frozen.   The campaign here is of absolutely astounding quality and length - my first full playthrough of the game took roughly 80 hours, even without dozens of sidequests. No matter your choice of origin character or custom, you'll find the campaign to be deeply satisfying. However, as noted by the developers, you are meant to play with the origin story characters - and it shows. Each origin character has at least half a dozen unique encounters. While the game is still engaging if you're playing as a custom character, the origin stories really do allow for a better capacity for role playing and it's interaction in the game world.  For the Steam Awards of 2016, this is my pick for the Most Astounding Game. The staggering amount of interactions in the game, even in alpha, can be overwhelming. Divinity: Original Sin 2 could very well shape up to be Game of the Year 2017 for me."

30,Ex Nihiloish,295,"2,142",827,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,220.5,"I'm 72 years old and these have been the best 20 hours of my life.  EDIT:: After playing through the game multiple times, including finishing it on Honour Mode, I have to say that my opinion of this game is even higher than it was after those first 20 hours. After finishing this game, it feels like my life is complete and there's nothing left to live for. This may be the last game I ever play and review I ever write. I would like to thank Larian for filling a void that has been plaguing me for more than half a century.  I found the main story as well as every single side quest/story to be fun and interesting. There are no boring fetch quests as far as I can tell. How you handle side quests and whether you complete them or not 'does' affect the ending; as such, they could be considered extensions of the main story. (You could be unsatisfied with the ending if you just rush through and skip things.)  You can build your characters any way you see fit and almost any build is completely viable. If you don't like the way you built your characters, just wait until you complete Act 1 and you can rebuild them any way you want as frequently as you want all the way up to the very end of the game; this is very good for testing new things out. By the end of the game my main character was a fire breathing Geo/Pyro battle mage that wielded a fire staff, used Warfare skills and showered my enemies in meteors with some necromancy for physical damage in case the enemy had too much resistance to those elements; she was pretty godly. I plan on trying a solo Honour mode run next with a similar but more diverse build. (I love the lizards!)  For me, the best part of this game is the combat. It's extremely well done and very fun. I can't really say any more than what the other reviews cover though. Just know that if a fight seems absolutely impossible, that it really isn't. I've gone into fights where half my party was annihilated before I got to do anything, yet I still emerged victorious. There's always a way to win even if the enemy has you outnumbered and outleveled; just gotta think!  Like many reviews state, there are still some bugs. As far as I can tell, they are all minor. After multiple play throughs on multiple difficulties I have not experienced any major bugs. Nothing game breaking and nothing that really affected my gameplay much.  The few bugs I've experienced:  - Many unvoiced lines in Arx.  - Incorrect journal entries.  - Sometimes a character would act blind in combat even though they weren't (could't use any ranged skills, couldn't see around themselves, but this was rare and only lasted a single turn.)  - Sometimes the enemy AI would derp out and they'd just run around or repeatedly climb up and down a ladder until they were out of AP.  - Custom undead characters do not receive the appropriate immunities, such as bleeding and suffocation. (though I don't recall any of my characters ever being afflicted with Bleed...) (Fane does receive these immunities)  - Undead afflicted with Decay will not attempt to avoid poison puddles (Not sure if this is a bug or an oversight).  - Altitude does not affect many player or enemy melee attacks. (Entities 10+ meters above can be struck with melee.) But it does affect some skills, such as Dragon's Blaze, Laser Ray, charging skills, Battle Stomp, etc.  ... I think that's about it. I'll add more if I remember them.  Some reviews complain about enemies being omniscient and knowing all of your strengths and weaknesses (including whether you're undead or not), which is true, but it's also true for players. Any player with Loremaster on one of their characters can examine any NPC or enemy to gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Only one of your characters needs Loremaster. If you examine with someone that doesn't have it, they use the skill level of whoever does, even if that person is dead. (This even works on the final boss, at no point in the game is it unfair that enemies can spot your weaknesses.)  So in summary, very fun game, great character customization, great combat, good story, a few minor bugs. It can be challenging in some scenarios but it's supposed to be; that's at least half the fun. I could mention the poor inventory management but countless reviews already cover that.  Tip: Carry a couple pieces of +Thievery and +Loremaster gear with you to make sure you can pick any lock and identify any item. There may be times when your base skill isn't sufficient.   TL;DR: Recommended, as shown above. 10/10 on the Completely Subjective, Arbitrary and Useless rating system."
31,TeaBagTom,146,63,1,"September 28, 2016",Recommended,68.3,"Ok...so beat act 1, and holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•larian out did themselves. Everything from the atmosphere to the character building has been improved, using the same formula as before and making every aspect better. The combat is the same style but with many subtle at first differences that expand into a lot more combat flexibility.   Update (Release): The game has finally released and I really have to say...Larian has out-done themselves. Playing through the game on Tactician and seeing how the AI does its best to break the combat system like a real player would, ending their turn with their back to a wall so your rogue is inefective, reversing your moves by throwing water on the enemy you just shocked and stunning your entire party, it's an incredible system that Larian has created so much flexibility, every move of every fight becomes a question of ""did that just happen? can I really do this?"" which is something no other game can capture.  Gone are the supercharged ridiculous characters of the first game, replaced with smarter and more adept enemies that force you to make better decisions. The flexibility in character creation and the much more intuitive world makes me excited every chance I get to jump on and uncover just a bit more of the world. The inclusion of a darker story and races adds a much needed party diversity and the lore being less silly pulls you in far more to the atmosphere (which is beautiful...from the musical score to the graphics) creating a much more enjoyable transition from combat to exploring, and giving you more to WANT to explore.   The beautiful score and excellent voice acting talent (so far) has been an incredible treat in an age when games have been spending less and less time and devotion to world building and character development. The party while smaller than some CRPGs, is fully fleshed out with interesting characters who I actually want to talk to and interact with.  So far I am incredibly excited with the release and looking forwarding to simply getting through ACT 1 on tactician and exploring the unknown. Well done Larian, you have brought art back into the gaming industry."
32,AKatarzynaK,681,152,4,"October 21, 2017",Recommended,114.5,"This is without a doubt one of the best RPGs I have ever played and after completing it I can honestly say it has secured its place among my top favorite games of all time.   When beginning the game you have the option of creating your own character or choosing from one of several premade characters, each with their own unique backstories and questlines. I highly recommend going this route as these characters and their quests are very well written and interesting. I found myself extremely invested in my main character (Lohse) and what would become of her and her companions. It's also really interesting witnessing the members of your party, each with their own motivations and biases, try to work together while also clashing as they look out for their own best interests. Each character is so well written and perfectly voice acted that it really helped make what is already such an immersive game feel even more alive. The dialogue is great, whether it be the main characters or random NPCs, it really feels like everyone has their own unique personality.  The gameplay is incredibly fun, and I really can't think of the last time I had such a hard time putting down a game. You are given a lot of freedom, leaving it entirely up to you how you choose to progress throughout the world. There are often numerous ways to complete one task, depending on just how creative or good/evil you want to be. To add to this, the choices you make actually have consequences, and sometimes the line between what is right and what is wrong might not be so clear. So you will sometimes find that a decision you made might come back to haunt you in one way or another. I loved this and it was really cool seeing how some of the choices I made previously came to have a much wider impact than I had originally imagined.  The turn-based combat system is really well done and there are lots of ways in which you can get creative and use the environment to your advantage. Each battle is well designed and interesting, with each type of enemy presenting their own unique strengths and weaknesses. You have to really put some thought into exactly how you design your group, providing for a nice amount of strategy both in and out of battle. If you find that you have messed up your build there is an option to respec, something which I think most of us can appreciate for its ability to save us a lot of wasted time.  It is also worth mentioning that there are quite a few options as far as difficulty. I did my first playthrough on Classic, which is the default difficulty, and found it to be perfect for me. There were a few fights which I struggled on, but anytime I faced such a roadblock I found that all I needed to achieve victory was to simply reevaluate my strategy. Personally I love just how rewarding of a feeling this can be, and I look forward to doing future playthrough on the harder difficulties. However if you're someone who is looking for less of a hassle, you will be happy to find that the lower difficulty, Explorer, will allow you to simply enjoy the ride without any frustration.  The quests are extremely fun and varied, some of which require solving puzzles, riddles, or getting a bit more creative with your abilities and items. One thing I really loved about the quest system is that it doesn't hold your hand, meaning that unlike some RPGs that basically give you a GPS tracker showing you exactly where you need to go, this game tends to just point you in a general direction and expect you to figure it out on your own. Now if this is offputting to you, please know I am speaking as someone with a truly awful sense of direction. I had a ton of fun with this and found that getting lost while trying to find where I needed to go to next provided for some of my favorite moments. Some of the random encounters you come across as you explore are the most surprising and rewarding experiences in the game.   The attention to detail is truly incredible and the world really feels so alive. Even areas that at first glance appear to be devoid of life might have something hidden. Especially with the pet pal ability, which allows you to talk to animals, or spirit vision which allows you to see/speak to ghosts, you'll find that if you look close enough there is no shortage of things to be seen or done. And to top this all off the soundtrack is incredible, providing the perfect music to accompany you on what is truly an epic journey.  The universe that Larian have built here is absolutely astounding and they managed to pack so much into this game that it's honestly a bit overwhelming at times. Between all of the characters and their questlines, the decisions you have to make throughout the game, and the sheer size of the world, it's truly impossible to take it all in on just one run. Speaking as someone who rarely plays games a second time, I'm already gearing up for my second trip into Divinity Original Sin 2 and imagine I'll be making even more eventually.   Now that I've ranted and raved about just how much I adore this game I must point out really the only negative thing I have to say about it, and that is just how buggy it can be. During the course of my 111 hour playthrough I ran into a number of bugs, ranging from mildly annoying to gamebreaking. The biggest one, of course, being the gamebreaking bug which made it impossible for me to enter into a room you need to use to begin the final quest. In order to get around this I had to get a bit creative and basically stack items until I could get one of my characters to glitch into said room, then allowing the rest of my party to teleport to me. While I am obviously pleased that I was able to get past this annoying bug, I can't help but be frustrated that such a problem would even exist in the first place. For as much as I love this game some of the bugs I faced really took away from my overall enjoyment and I truly hope Larian will patch them as soon as possible. Of course I'm sure there are those who played the game without facing bugs, but it doesn't change the fact that I was unfortunate enough to encounter them and that some of you might as well.   Overall I truly love this game and believe it deserves all of the praise it is getting. As I mentioned, my one and only complaint are some of the bugs I encountered. While frustrating, such issues can easily be fixed through a patch. And it does speak to just how captivating I found this game to be that I continued to press on despite these issues. There is absolutely no denying that this was a game crafted with a lot of love, and so I have complete faith that Larian will continue to be very active in it post release. If you're on the fence than I suggest you wait a bit to buy, but I imagine it won't take long for these issues to be fixed. For 45 Euro I managed to get one of the most amazing gaming experiences I have ever had and I encourage everyone who is interested to give it a try. This game is a masterpiece, plain and simple."

Wipe that nightmare out of your memory with the combat in this game. It's fun, complex and actually makes  you look forward to battles. - Each companion is unique and complex.

34,Retrotus,221,172,6,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,38.7,"If you want good old classical RPG feel that does not kill your smart with stupid RNG, If you want something that is not just rush in and kill everything and be a godlike all the time, if you really think that games nowadays has made you dumb and numb, then Divinity 2 is for you.  For example my experience so far has been..  I chose tactician difficulty as it said enemies will use tricks that they wont otherwise. i played few hours and was about to lower my difficulty from tactician and now i'm glad that i did not. It really makes you save scumming A LOT, but other hand it forces you to learn some dirty tricks to defeat enemies as they really do some dirty hoccus poccus to you. The difficulty lives by it name 100% in this game imo  It forces you kind a explore world more to find out ways to beat something that serves your royal head in a plate.. And when you do that you find some many interesting stuff from the game world that you would probably just missed. Mostly in other games exploring just feels kind a work but not in this one, it's rewarding  There has been many fights that i had to delay due lvl difference and bad gear, Fights that i need to find an alternative way to approach. Some situations feels so unfair until you really think it through. For me it is just pure joy, wanted so long something that is not just blatant rush in and slice everything or that stupid RNG kills your smart moves, it's you and your stupid moves and strategies what gets you killed.. and ofc i can blame a bit other games that has made your brain so dry for new ideas ;)  Same style goes with conversations. Listen what they have to say, it might help you later.. No it will help you later. Books, notes etc is rewarding to read as they can have life saving info or ways to unlock some puzzles later on. Sometimes even info about NPCs in game world wich you can use to get their favor in conversation. No, the game does not unlock conversation choises when you find info about people. For long time i haven't read so many diaries in game that i have in this game so far! Voice acting is not annoying to listen. DOS1 gave me that feel i was listening shakespeare but in this on they nailed it.  What i can say...  The victory is like drug now,  every nook and corner is my friend,  every item that is not nailed down is my salary or key to success,  every book or note makes me a bit more aware of the world in game. every stronger enemies that slain my team is like tasty revange when you come to beat them later on!  10/10 in my book  PS. if you are new to Divinity Orginal Sin, Tactician difficulty can be a bit harsh first ;)"
35,Riptide,57,248,8,August 4,Recommended,195.5,"After playing this game for a few weeks, I can say that DOS2 has replaced Skyrim as my all time favorite RPG. It's that good.  Pros: Voice acting, graphics, ""turn based"" combat, immersion factors all get a solid 10. I haven't finished the game, but so far the story is interesting, and even if the story ending stinks, it still has that draw you in factor. As for re-playability, it's already apparent to me that I'll have to play it again with the other available characters so I can experience their stories. There is the main story line, and each of the 5 pre-created characters have their own stories. I chose to create my own character, which means I have 3 of the 5 available pre-created characters as my compatriots, each with their own stories to be completed. With my current playthough, I'm not going to know how Sebille or Lohse's stories finish out. They're not in my party so, I gotta play again with them to find out how their stories end.  An EXTREMELY well crafted RPG. This one is a clear and unmistakable winner. Kudos to Larian for self-publishing to avoid the pressure to release the game before they completed what they intended the game to be. You guys got it correct.  Although I'm not a fan of third person, overlooking the party, view point games (I prefer first person... eyeballs forward),  this one succeeds in grasping my attention and refusing to let it go. I'm drawn in, focused, worried, and sssso happy when a fight is over and all the characters under my control are still alive, I'm almost bouncing up and down in my seat ready for the loot.   It's a blast to play!   The only downside I've felt so far - and it's not really terrible - is inventory management. There's a load of stats, and as with any RPG, we all want all the stats to be as high as possible. Well, it ain't gonna happen. There's the agonizing struggle around applying the puny number of level up points to a plethora of possibilities. And, the loot that's uncovered has a variety of statistical applications that can be distributed to... well... do I want this? Who best to give it to? Arrrrgh! I like those extra points with that, but this one has these two stats.... which one to choose? Maybe I could give it to this character... but then I lose those stats. Grrrrr! Maybe I should keep it for later on? No. Maybe I'll just sell it. No... should I wait? Maybe it'll be useful in this situation? What... ever.... should.... I... do??? **blank it*** I'll just sell it. No, I'll keep it for later. ARRRGH!!!  It's involved, at times frustrating, and can be overly time consuming. There's so many items that can enhance a variety of disparet statistics, it can be overwhelming. It's like a 20 page menu of delicious food at a great restaraunt to a starving man. I WANT IT ALL!!!  I've always been of the opinion that less is more. This game does not embrace that. There's a lot of items, that do a lot of different things, and I've probably spent more time trying to figure out who should get what, for the maximum impact, than I've spent exploring.  I'm not really unhappy about that though. For me, it's at most a minor annoyance. There is a crafting mechanism that I could take a deep dive into, which some people will do because they like exploring that type of mystery. Me? I try not to be an item hoarding ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but ultimately I lose out on certain discoveries. But hey, it's all good y'know? I may miss out on a side quest here or there, but there's too much other content to discover so even though I've ""broken"" a few side quests so far, I've forgotten about them so I just press onward with the quests that are currently before me.  Let me put it this way: Inventory management can be tedious, but if you ""explore"" it, certain items can open additional quests. Sheesh! As if there wasn't enough to do already!  Oh, and if you put a point into Pet Pal, you can talk to the animals. Which open up probably a few dozen side quests to have fun with. I mean, why wouldn't you? There's only a hundred quests along the way, so why not open up a few dozen more??? Awww... go on! You got the time!  This game is easily worth the current price of around $40. My favorite gaming experiences have been with RPG's, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now my favorite of all time.  Well done Larian!"
36,Emperor Gandhi,281,137,2,May 20,Recommended,104.4,"Like my reviews? Go follow my Curator page.   As a younger gamer, I never got to experience games like Diablo 2 or Baldur's Gate in their prime, and by the time I was old enough to understand and appreciate the RPG genre, the gaming industry moved onto 3D, first/third-person RPGs like Fallout 3 and Oblivion. Eventually, CRPGs made a comeback, and I jumped onto that hype train only to be pretty disappointed. As other CRPGs haven't quite hit the spot for me, I saw this game get released on Steam and chose not to buy it because I thought I'd be underwhelmed yet again.  That was a huge mistake. While Divinity: Original Sin 2 suffers from some very serious flaws, the game's strengths are done so well that the fairly popular claim that this game is one of the ""best RPGs of all time"" is completely justified.  Graphics As was the case with the first game, the visuals are surprisingly pretty. Even though the overall tone of this game is rather dark (especially compared to D:OS 1) it still retains some of the first game's light-hearted charm and this can be reflected in the bright, cartoony visuals. The main characters are all interesting and unique visually, and the character creation system itself is incredibly deep from an appearance standpoint. Aside from some occasional frame drops, the game is pretty impressive visually.  Gameplay Divinity: Original Sin 2's biggest strength, one that makes it one of the all-time greats, is its incredible amount of player choice. This is reflected in almost every aspect of the game. The addition of physical and magic armor means that you're going to need to think a little bit more when it comes to party composition and prioritizing targets, while simply stunlocking an enemy to death isn't as effective now. On top of this, with the sheer amount of skills in the game, there are so many different ways to approach a situation. For example, you could hack away at a troll, or you could turn him into a chicken and teleport him into a pit of lava. Or, you could summon a monster (one that's just as large as that troll) on top of a fire, causing the monster to be infused with fire, and have the two duke it out with each other. The variety in skills adds so much depth to the already refined turn-based combat mechanics of the first game. While some skills and talents are better than others, the classes overall are pretty fairly balanced and offer you a lot of wiggle room to make your characters more well-rounded, and the weaker skills/talents are still playable at least. The game is also difficult, but it very rarely felt unfair. Even then, thanks to the incredible amount of choice in this game, you can easily exploit these unfair fights. Where the game falls flat gameplay-wise, however, is the final boss. Without going into spoilers, it takes the biggest strengths of this game and throws them out the window, turning into an absolute mess where you barely get to do anything. Overall though, aside from the final boss, everything in the gameplay department is perfect. The combat mechanics are deep and incredibly fun, the game overall is mostly fairly balanced, the armor system makes the game more interesting, and the sheer amount of choice makes just about anything possible. The gameplay alone makes this game worthwhile at full price, and the enhanced edition should (hopefully) make it even better.  Story Unfortunately, on the other end of the spectrum, the weakest part of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is its story. While the writing is good and the pacing starts off fairly consistent, this all goes out the window for the last third of the game. From the big climax in Act 3 and onward, the pacing goes all over the place. Act 3 as a whole is over extremely quickly, while Act 4 is drawn out some more but still fairly easy to blow through. As mentioned before, the final boss takes the biggest strengths and throws them out the window, and this includes the writing. As an example of this, one of my party members told my character that he would support me no matter what decision I made, only to get mad at me for choosing something he apparently didn't support. This happened over the span of about 30 seconds, and I'm not exaggerating that either. All of the character development of your party members is thrown aside for some reason, and it makes the finale that much more frustrating. On top of this, none of the endings are satisfying. While I understand the approach they tried to take, the drop in quality of the writing made all of them feel stupid and nullified all the progress you made in the game. However, everything else is great. Fort Joy was brilliant, and I loved watching the island slowly open up for you to explore as you escaped it. Driftwood, while definitely a lot slower paced, was filled to the brim with entertaining quests and the classic D:OS charm. Plus, the amount of player choice is also reflected here. You can talk your way out of a situation in a wide variety of different ways, and your decisions do have weight to them. Overall, while the first two acts of the game are incredible, the last two are not as great and will likely leave you disappointed.  Audio Remember how I said that almost everything in this game could be changed by the player? Well I wasn't kidding. You can choose your character's instrument, which plays during the battle (to the music) when you kill an enemy. I also personally find it pretty impressive how much of this game is voice acted. With the exception of a few conversations, almost everything has competent voice acting. Another pleasant suprise was how much I enjoyed the soundtrack. While I liked the first game's music, not much stuck out for me aside from the classic tavern music and the main menu theme. In this game, however, I found myself humming along to music like the Lady Vengeance theme and the tavern battle theme. While neither of these things are major highlights to the game, they're both done very well and do make the experience significantly more entertaining as a result.  Replayability As choice is this game's biggest strength, the replayability for D:OS 2 is very high, moreso than most other RPGs in my opinion. There's no way you can see or do everything in a single playthorugh, plus the party member quests are entertaining enough that you'll probably want to see them through for every character. Plus, with the inclusion of the excellent Game Master mode, even if you don't do multiple playthroughs of the game, you'll be spending hours on top of hours in this game. There's so many different combinations of classes and skills that experimenting is incredibly fun, and so you'll definitely have a lot of motivation to play through the game again.  Verdict To conclude, while Divinity: Original Sin 2 suffers from things like frame drops and an incredibly weak finale, the game's strengths overshadow its weaknesses so much that I still wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who might even be remotely interested. People weren't kidding, this truly is one of the best RPG games ever made, and the enhanced edition has the potential to make it the best.

I have very high expectations and I'm rarely satisfied with games today. It would be more appropriate to say that I've been 'content' with the games I play now and leave it at that.  Well, that is not the case with Divinity: Original Sin 2.   I'm quite envious of the fact that I was not involved with the design of this game. It has exceeded my expectations and provided me with many hours of gaming pleasure. I can only hope and pray that future sequels, please let there be more to come, are of equal or greater quality.  Thank you Larian for the many hours of gaming pleasure I have received from this game. Please keep up the good work. My sincere compliments to you and your staff."

If you like a great story, great turn based combat with an insane amount of depth, and beautiful visuals, you will fall in love with this game as much as I did.  I've played through DOS1/DOS EE around 7 times, and while the story in that game was unintresting, the gameplay alone kept me coming back. DOS2, even in its alpha state, is a vast improvement over DOS1/DOS EE in everyway.  Kill whoever you want, steal whatever isn't nailed down, Dos2 gives more freedom than any rpg to date.  *Slight Spoilers*: You can kill the gaurds on the boat, and the game has dialouge to reflect that you did. You can also kill your companions on the boat or leave them to die, and there is special dialouge for both of these actions.  Update: After having finished the full game I can safely say this is my favorite rpg of all time, period. Larian did an icredible job with this game, and its very obvious just how much love and care went into this game.  Update as of Nov 24th 2017: I've now put in over 600 hours in and I still can't stop playing it. When I'm not playing it I'm think about, and if that's not an indication of this game's quality I don't know what is. This is my game of the century, and Larian Studios has given me hope for the game industry. This is a must buy, especially if you want to give the middle finger to scummy publishers who fill their games with microtransactions, loot boxes, and other anti consumer pratices. A few bugs here and there, but nothing that truly detracts from the over all experience, and the game is patched roughly once, and Larian is one of the few publishers that I trust to fix everything (even if things that are wrong are miniscule)."

40,wcis,339,100,3,"November 7, 2017",Recommended,151.6,"An adventure! If I had to describe Divinity: Original Sin 2 in a word, that would be it. An adventure. Without a doubt, it‚Äôs the best modern cRPG game up to date. And as an oldschool gamer, I can understand when someone is saying that nothing can stand in one line with games like Planescape: Torment or Baldur‚Äôs Gate. Well, it couldn‚Äôt. Until now. Times changing, and so gaming industry is changing. And we have just received the best, most polished cRPG game ever made. It has to be said, even if we are sentimental.   The world of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is full of content and what‚Äôs the best, we can interact with almost everything and everyone. There are no boring NPC‚Äôs with exactly the same dialogue lines. In this game everyone is unique and has something to say. Also, we are talking here about huge cRPG game that is fully voice acted (!) and it‚Äôs not Oblivion-like voice acting with 5 actors. The main narrator, who is with us most of the time, and all the other voice actors, did an outstanding job here. Every character sounds special.  If you have played first Original Sin you know what to expect from fights. They can be approached in many different ways. Even in tough fights, one properly used scroll or skill can change everything. Of course in both ways, because we can easily lose. The fights are hard, made to think in strategic ways and what‚Äôs the most important, they are very satisfying. Comparing to other cRPG games it‚Äôs one of the best parts of Divinity.  It took me roughly 105 hours to finish the game once, so it can be said that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the biggest cRPG games. What‚Äôs more, this game has high replayability value. Every character has its own personality and its own origin story. By playing with different characters we have new quests and we can approach many situations in totally different way ‚Äì origin characters have their own interactions across whole game. The main story is interesting and I have never lost my interest. I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything, but it‚Äôs just really good piece of writing. Side quests are keeping high level as well. Same as in first Original Sin, we also receive minimal amount of help in all the quests. We have to think, search and read. Just like in real cRPG game.  I have completed this game few days ago and to be honest, I can‚Äôt wait to play it again. I am thinking about new characters and about making different decisions in several points of the game. It‚Äôs something amazing. There are many huge games, like The Witcher 3 or Fallout 4 that can give you +/- 100 hours of actual playtime, but those are mostly single experience games. You are not playing them again. There is something different in Divinity that make you want to play it again. More and more! In Civilization series we are saying about ‚Äúone more turn‚Äù syndrome. Here we have ‚Äúone more hour‚Äù, ‚Äúone more evening‚Äù and ‚Äúone more day syndrome‚Äù!  There are no perfect, 10/10 games, and there is no difference here. The game is quite fresh, so there are still bugs. I haven‚Äôt experienced any gamebreaking bug though, but there are many small things that for sure will be fixed in the future. What‚Äôs more, the final act and final battle are both the weakest parts of the game. You can feel that devs were in hurry here, but on the other side, whole game is so good, that this ‚Äúrushed‚Äù ending won‚Äôt outshine beautiful, interesting and so carefully designed game. It simply can‚Äôt.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is, in my humble opinion, the best game of year 2017. Let‚Äôs just hope we will see more cRPG‚Äôs like this in the future (Obsidian, we are looking at you). Do yourself a favour and buy this game. It will be the best +/- 100 hours you can have as a gamer. And for this price, that is not even close to the other ""AAA"" titles with unhealthy DLC policy, it's a steal.   Whoop.

44,Shard of Manus,41,75,1,March 13,Recommended,177.4,"Divinity Original Sin 2 - Larian's second foray into the grand re-imagining of the Divinity universe, and one can only say... they really outdid themselves this time.   Larian Studios takes a bold step into the old RPG style that players were so enamoured by with the original Divine Divinity, only with all the polish of modern capabilities, and the extremely successful and informative release of Divinity Original Sin (and its Enhanced Edition) granting them insight into the necessary improvements that make DOS2 the absolute masterpiece that it is.   Players can be sure to find themselves trapped within this game for such lengths of time that the outside world shall begin to pass by unnoticed, as one becomes so transfixed with the beauty of Larian's latest release. Divinity Original Sin 2 is perhaps the most engaging, exciting, satisfying and well-designed Adventure RPG of the decade... and that is quite the title to fight for.   -----------------   The world of DOS2 is massive. Hours upon hours upon hours of dense, creative and unique content stacked together in this vibrant and stunning game world. Every location itself is chock full of fantastic characters, all fully voiced with quality acting, and each with a rich and realistic personality and story that drive the player's desire to uncover every ounce of their story and build upon the deep lore and sprawling history of the world of Divinity.   The main campaign spans four Acts, each filled to the brim with hours of non-linear content including side quests, treasure hunts, battles, secrets to be uncovered and more all with multiples ways to be completed and numerous outcomes - and with such immense amounts of freedom and player choice, the likes of which almost no modern game can compete with, there really is no dull moment in Divinity, and this game is a shining example of the effort and dedication Larian puts into their work.   -----------------   The combat of DOS2 has been revamped since the previous release, though maintaining much of what it once was. Divinity Original Sin 2, like its predecessor, adopts turn-based combat, and turns it into one of the most finely crafted and perfect editions of this style of combat to date. Every moment of battle is exciting and even for one such as I, whom rarely plays turn-based games, the combat was astoundingly well designed and thoroughly enjoyable.   Players command all manner of skills thanks to the diverse customisation options available and freedom of choice, with crafting bombs, traps, potions, poisons, arrows and much, much more, players will always find themselves with an array of tools with which to combat the enemy. No class is tied to any particular tree of skills, and one can mix and match as they see fit... provided they learn how to best use such abilities.   DOS2 encourages interactivity with the environment, and players have much freedom to use objects, terrain and combinations of attacks for devastating effects. If there is oil, set it ablaze. If there is water, freeze it so that your enemies slip. The combinations are many, and are far deeper and complex than just those above. This game holds some of the most complex and intriguing combat systems I know.   Combat is by no means forgiving, and the game boasts a variety of difficulty options that make enemies easier, or expand their skills sets and AI intelligence such as that they pose worthy adversaries to even well skilled players.   -----------------   Something brought to players for the first time in Divinity Original Sin makes its triumphant return in DOS2, and that is the wonderfully designed multiplayer aspect. Drop-in / drop-out co-op allows players to seamlessly enter the world of another player and join them on their journey... be they ally or foe.   The multiplayer system is beyond extensive, and to the delight of some players, and the woe of others, players can act as friend or foe on their journey - and betrayal is a sweet thing.   The absolute freedom of the multiplayer system does have its faults however, as playing with strangers can sometimes lead to them rushing through things, progressing without you or making choices that you didn't want to make. It is highly recommended that players save co-op until after their first playthrough, or only play with friends that one can communicate with easily and rely on. DOS2s world is too big and too grand to risk someone spoiling it for you.   However, in my experience, playing DOS2 with a friend or two (or 3) is an inimitable experience that all should try. Working together or against one another towards the finale of this game is thrilling beyond imagination.   -----------------   So, alongside the beautifully crafted world, intricate characters, massive freedom of choice, expansive customisation and awesome combat, Divinity Original Sin 2, much like other installments in the series, boasts an amazing soundtrack.   Composed by Borislav Slavov, DOS2s soundtrack combines epic scores, emotional pieces and the jovial warmth of tavern music in one of the best compositions of the year and even beyond, rivalling that of Hollow Knight, NieR: Automata and potentially even the Witcher 3.   With traditional styles of RPG music reminiscent of golden oldies, each with its own unique flair and spark, and returning tracks from other Divinity titles, the music of Larian's latest game is something no-one will not enjoy. Hours of beautiful tracks, some of which are placed so heart-wrenchingly well within the game world that you will no doubt be straight onto YouTube and listening to the whole lot for hours.   With everything else DOS2 has to offer, the Soundtrack really is the cherry on top, and it is something to behold.   -----------------   To summarise Divinity Original Sin 2 into one word, it would have to be... brave. Larian Studios started the development of this game precariously, via Kickstarter backing; and after the amazing success of Divinity Original Sin, they had certainly garnered enough interest to support their new installment. Their return to old school RPG styles was a risk that paid off... not because the style is popular, but because Larian took something good, and turned it into something beyond great.   DOS2 is, and will no doubt remain for some time, among my favourite games of all time. I have sunk so many hours into this game, through several playthroughs and still each new one is unique and engaging. Here is a timeless game. Play it, with all my heart, I tell you to play it."
45,Squeaks,60,64,5,February 19,Recommended,77.4,"I am a very casual gamer. I played WoW many years ago obsessively, and since then have really only gotten into a couple of flings with games. As someone who works full time, I don't have the time (or, honestly, the interest) in playing a game that requires me to play ALL THE TIME to keep up with everyone else. Adversely, I'm usually pretty bored with single player games.  I also hate turn-based games.  Despite that, I was browsing the most-purchased in the Steam store and decided on buying this game after reading the reviews.   This game took me about a month to complete, and I clocked in 75 hours. I can't even remember the last time a campaign took me more than 8 hours.... I actually was interested in what NPC's had to say, talked to everyone, opened every chest, etc. Not because I felt I had to, but because I really loved the game that much. Also, if I had played this game without looking up most of the quests online, it would've taken me at least double that time.  The combat was super fun, even though it was turn based. I was constantly looking for new spellbooks, planning out my rotations, etc.  It was also challenging - I really had to make sure my party was well-equipped and balanced in their abilities.  There were some fights I had to retry a few times, and it felt like more of a fun challenge than a tedious part of the gameplay.    After finishing the game, I'm going to go back and replay it a second time with a different strategy and a slightly higher difficulty.  I loved everything about this game, even though it's not my usual style of game at all - anyone who's on the fence, I definitely recommend it!"

49,iingaate,72,223,3,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,143.3,"First time reviewing a game, but felt I should on this one. I never did play the first game though heard good things about it, so figured give the second a run. So far...even in early access I can't say I was disappointed. The game it's self reminds me of classic computer RPGs and pen 'n paper RPGs I played when I was much younger just a bit more fair and easier to understand yet still maintaining a lot of what made them challenging. Character customization starts a bit limited but as you get higher in levels its more about what you want to play and what your party members be. You are not locked into your starting class at all and I love that, hoping they have a lot more choices in the full release.   Gameplay wise is point and click, though I found there is a lot to interact with in the world in different ways, one of the more different ways I found was that playing an Elf or having an Elf in your group, the elf can eat a corpse and gain the memories of that person, and it actually does play a part in the game. Combat is much of the same, point and click with a lot of tactical choices to make, the enemy AI is well refined and act in actually very smart ways even on the easier difficulties. I also found it pretty neat how your spells, items and attacks can change the battle ground and make hazards for yourself and your enemies, with the enemies able to do the same. Such as freezing a wet spot on the ground to give a chance of someone slipping on the spot or shocking the water with lighting to stun everyone standing in the wet spot. Though at times at least for me I found it hard to move to avoide these hazards at times like the area they were affecting were slightly larger than they really were.  I even tried a bit of co-op with friends and a bit hidden in a sense once we figured it out, connecting with one another was clean and easy to do.   Storywise I found interesting enough, a dark world with many dark themes with demons, torture and corruption. The premade characters have backgrounds and behave well according to their backgrounds. Another different system in this game is the tag system. Basicly pick tags for your character and you will have in game choices that you can make based just on those tags you pick. The pre mades having different choices as well they can make based on their stand alone backgrounds. Though it does feel you can get same results no matter your background still, it does help with immersion and at in making your created character feel seprate from the rest.   Graphics, are not that important to me, but they are decent enough in this game. Though playing completely zoomed out (pretty much the only way to play an RPG like this) I found it a bit difficult to notice things I could pick up or interact with since they are so small. A few rare times I misclicked on something because of how small it is. I have an older system, so I wasn't able to play on the highest settings, I was able to however able to play on high even though the game suggested I play on low. So I can see pretty much everyone able to play this game with no issues. Even when I tried the highest settings I just had a slight drop in Frame rate.  Overall Divinity 2 I recommend highly, especially if you are a fan of old school RPGs and Pen 'n Paper RPGs, you will feel right at home playing this with a high level of immersion and ability to costumize your character however you desire. Story had been done before but it's presented well in the world, and should be interesting enough to keep you playing. Combat is deep, and will challenge the thinking sides of your brain to approach each encounter in most effective way possible, plus have you thinking best way to build your characters to deal with threats in your prefered way. You might find a little frustration in interacting with the world due to how small things are and will even miss a few things if you aren't careful, but it shouldn't be a big enough issue to remove any enjoyment in the game.   Hope you found this helpful if you took the time to read it."
50,Athravan,"1,782",80,4,January 8,Recommended,99.9,"Now that 2017 is but a memory I can say with confidence that Divinity: Original Sin 2 was my Game of the Year. Although I backed the game on Kickstarter (just like the first) and had an Early Access copy, I didn‚Äôt play it until full launch so that I could fully immerse myself. And immerse myself I did into this high-fantasy adventure that manages to make the magical and fantastical feel realistic and gritty. It has taken everything that was good about Divinity: Original Sin and improved upon it, whilst also making it so you don‚Äôt need to have played the first in any way as it takes place a thousand years before.  Whether I‚Äôm following a quest that portrays me as the savior of the universe (hero complex much?) or trying to solve the angst of a tiny rat I really believe in my characters and their responses. There is a balance between the epic and the banal, the frivolous and the fateful that creates a woven world that is wonderful to experience.  In my first playthrough, co-op with a friend, I‚Äôm a summoner, focusing on gathering my minions. I‚Äôm a bit heavy handed though, I‚Äôll send my minions into battle at a moments notice from afar, but stand aside, watching the ebb and flow, supporting and commanding the field. I speak harsh truths and it frequently gets me into trouble even though I feel righteous. In my solo playthrough, I‚Äôm a morally ambiguous pickpocketing hitman with a deep, dark past that I‚Äôve blocked from memory. I fight with my words, and flirt with absolutely everyone, often getting what I desire in alternative ways. Even though the majority of the quests are the same on multiple playthroughs (bar the character story quests which too, are dark and deep), it feels different. Different dialogue and varying methods result in genuinely diverse results and that‚Äôs testament to the freedom, flexibility and depth of the game.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 rewards exploration and creativity as many side quests can only be discovered or completed by turning over every rock, talking to every NPC or trying things that are a little out of the box. This may frustrate some but delighted me at every stage. There are no glowing quest signs and immersion breaking yellow exclamation marks here. If you don‚Äôt like reading, that‚Äôs fine ‚Äì as everything is beautifully and uniquely voiceovered. But if you don‚Äôt like paying attention to detail, you‚Äôre going to miss out on a lot of the fun. This game is for people who like to genuinely invest their time and attention into the world they‚Äôre playing and the characters in it. Perhaps that, above all else is what reminds me of the D&D campaigns from my youth that I sorely miss.  Tactically the combat is as complicated as you make it, with different difficulty settings that cater to your preference for challenge. You can brute force things if you‚Äôre so inclined, but you‚Äôre rewarded for playing smart at any level and the game gives you the tools to feel like a tactical genius, with a deep satisfaction when you pull off a clever combo.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 has the old school charm of Baldur‚Äôs Gate and Planescape Torment but with modern mechanics and beautiful aesthetics, I finally feel like an RPG has surpassed them. It only took a few decades for us to get here. I wonder if this is the pinnacle of the genre and how long it‚Äôll be before I can say that about a game again.   ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• If you find the reviews of an old Welsh lady interesting, please follow  My Curator Page.

I don't like tedious quests, I dont like common NPC stereotypes, I hate lousy combat mechanics and poor strategy, and above all else I hate it when a game plays like it literally cant spell ""scenario"".  But raising a baby demon chicken to conquer the world and tele-rob ignorant merchants? Igniting grenades in people's pockets and befriend a cat for no effing reason ? Just cause you know, he's like mysterious and all? And he's a really good looking cat, all the while being lectured by a crab? Oh, and trying to become a demigod and save the world, apparently  insane pathing possibilities (OH DEAR TP) Well rounded scenario, emo NPCs that drink blood or are possessed by demons like it's totally fine, and GOD the landscapes!!! I did spend a whole 10 minutes exploring a map and praising its beauty before remembering I had entered a fight. Hell, I just like clicking a spell and not actually launching it cause the casting animation is then suspended and they're F***ING MAGNIFICENT (not as much as my cat, tho. He's a nice cat.)  So yeah, Maybe it's a bit too much, maybe it's been written a hundred times but playing this in coop mode was (one of?) the best gaming experience in my entire life. Entertaining, challenging, captivating, and of course it makes no sense sometimes cause you keep doing awesome tricks with your cat to try F**KING with the scenario. But you know what? It adapts to all the sh*t you do. It gets your sh*t together. It gets it all together, puts it in a backpack, all your sh*t, so it's all together. And then it makes wonders from out of nowhere and you're like ""but I was trying to act crazy! And I did! And still, cool sh*t keeps happening! It's a F***ING transsh*itation!!! Like alchemy or something!""  It's beautiful, smart sometimes even touching, funny as hell, and you know the best part? It has a cool cat. And it's nice.  And hidden quests, and insane replayability, and nutsy combos, and a perfect leveling/reroll system, and Malady is kinda sexy but like, not entirely but that's okay. And talking boat, and a condor, a phoenix omelett and A CAT. AND GODS AND ALL BUT A CAT MOSTLY. And you know what? THE CAT REALLY IS IMPORTANT!!!! I mean even a common (though really nice) cat DOES HAVE its own scenario and voice acting!! Cause every EFFING DIALOG has voice acting!!! like hours of it!  This is your best investment this year and if you have a friend that you like and he likes good ol RPGs like you (Baldur's gate, Neverwinter Night, Icewind Dale's fans, I'm looking right at yo, dawgs), buy it and offer it like my friend offered it to me.

58,Kodijack!,"2,014",203,10,"October 2, 2017",Recommended,156.2,"(Remark 1: I never tried the game in EA. I knew it was wiser to wait for full release. So everything here bases on the final thing  Remark 2: I don't give a damn about hype or hate. I usually don't read a single word about a game prior to purchase and decide to purchase based on experience and judgement of the presentation. And due to high age and experience I usually don't fail there hehe) )  Woah! What a masterpiece RPG. I really already liked the first DOS (and its predecessors, although completly different, too). And I'm not much into turn-based top-down (more or less, I know it's 3D) RPGs at all. And this time they really managed to drag you into their world. Many races, interesting locations, tons of secrets, tons of sidequests, billions of lines of conversations... It's not a perfect game, and surely has some tiny flaws, but the overall experience damn rocks. That love for all those details. Like at some point there is a Pianist-ghost (which you don't see usually without a skill) and beside her is a book of Kirill's (*sigh*) best songs. And you can ask her to play those. And she does. Spent like 15 minutes in that mansion just standing there and listen to Kirill's songs. That ""pet-pal""-Talent alone is worth a thumbs-up. It's so enjoyable talking to ""critters"" on a map. Getting hints, secrets or even quests. Or just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t nonsense :)   Pro-Hint (super tiny spoiler): Try to keep that cat alive at all costs you'll met very soon into the game ,-)  If you love RPG, like or can endure turn-based, there's no way around this one. GET IT. If you dislike RPG or turn-based: stay the heck away. This is not the droid you're looking for.   The good (what to love):  Play as one of the ""origin""-characters. With their own complete backstory. Which is highly recommended for your first playthrough. But you can still customize your character completly.  Graphics are really neat  SFX/Music is really great. Sadly no more new (obviously) tracks from Kirill. RIP man!  You can talk with animals. One of the coolest features ever in an RPG. Meet snobby cats, cynical crabs, hopelessly positive dogs, etc. Not only for fun, but also for quests, hints, secrets or for pure distracting amusement...Awesome feature!  MODS! The best thing a game could have. You don't like a particular feature? Get a mod. There is none? Make one. Every game should have that. PERIOD. This is and often was the distinct feature that seperated pretty good from AWESOME and long-lasting games.  Completely voiced, not one sentence is not spoken. I know, many people don't care, but it doesn't hurt either, does it? I personally like it for added immersion.  No bugs/crashed so far. After two complete playthroughs at the moment of this review. Not even a misaligned texture.  Often many ways to solve a problem. For example getting of the first island there are around 11 (right?) different ways to do that. Sure, most are pretty similar and end in more or less the same result, but as I often say: it's a game and not reality. Impossible to give you REAL freedom. It still feels like YOU chose the results.   Many actions DO have consequences. Some minor, some major.   Well done turn-based. From my noobish-PoV though. Fights are fun and can range from relaxing to OMFG-WHAT-HAVE-I-DONE.  Comparatively short loading-times. Once a map loaded, you instantly(!) switch areas (like to a cave or whatever else transition). VERY MUCH appreciated. Nothing kills immersion more than stupid 1-minute ""LOADING...""-screen. In and out of a cave in not a second. Yeah, great, thanks!  Tiny details like being able to make notes on the map. VERY helpful if you discover something that you MIGHT be able to solve/do/pickup/catch later.  You can specialize all of your companions upon you first meet them. Great detail! Like one of the characters but don't need their supposed role? Fine, change it. No problem.  End of Act 1, when you finally got a grip of things and how this crap works, you will get your option to RESPEC every character completely (including apprerance). YES! I love that. Some of us gamers don't want to put hundreds of hours into ONE game and multiple walkthroughs and be more efficient in JUST ONE walkthrough. Thanks for that. If you hate a feature like that, you don't HAVE to use it. The mediocre (not good, not bad, but no show-stopper either):  Some schools/talents/skills are somehow pointless and you will never use them. Good idea, bad execution  Some ambient chatter become VERY annoying VERY quickly when you're e.g. shopping near and micro-managing equipment. Damn stupid NPCs :-)  From time to time it doesn't really seem to matter much how you're playing (be the nice guy or the sociopathic arsewipe). Some or most encounters are bound to happen anyway either way. But well this is a game and not the real world, it's impossible to be prepared for everything :)  VERY high replayability (not a PRO for people with not much sparetime for gaming). Many ways to complete quests, enough people to form a party and hence change the quests/suprises/sidequests. This might be a big plus if you have much time at your hands.  If you hate micromanagement you might even be a lil frustrated at the lowest difficulty. You will have to manage gear, skills, talents and spells for four characters nearly every 5 meters when you've found a new thing. Lower difficulties are very forgiving though. But can still challenge you if you have zero idea of what's going on. But if everything's too much for you there are still MODS or even cheats.   No real Set-items. Well on the first Island there is a set. But not wearing the complete set curses you and by the time you'll have it complete it's of no use at all. And there isn't even a set-bonus. Reducing this to a boring errand for the completionist. The ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):  Items rarely really feel unique or great. Found a ""legendary""? Yeah well, walk 10meters and you'll find the next better one. Plus most non-""unique""-items are random which often results in horribly sucky items. Intelligence-requireing pants with +X strength. Strength-requirement-ring with +X Intelligence and some mage-stats. Yeah great. For selling. Boring. For example the first SET: Great to aquire. Requires lot of work/details. But you'll end up selling that stuff for some coins before even completing it to WEAR it. Meh, VERY unsatisfying.   SOMETIMES it can be hard to even spot your enemies in between turns due to all those status-effects on the screen. Could be worse, but could definately be better.  If you play on higher difficulties you might find some schools/classes/character-combinations pretty useless/unfair. That MIGHT kill it for you. But balancing a complex RPG like this perfectly is pretty much impossible to admit. No excuse? You're to judge...  Crafting sucks. No filtering, no sorting and you learn new recipes every few meters. But I failed to find the need to craft anything besides runes anyway. Recommended?  If you can wrap your head around turn-based and like RPGs? YESYESYESYESYES! Don't hesitate. Even if you don't much like top-down games. You'll quickly forget that (I usually prefer 1st-Person). This is one beautifully crafted gem, with love for details. I'd name it the Witcher-Series of turn-based-isometric-RPGs. And I'm a Witcher-Lover."
59,Metsakurat,"1,205",38,0,October 17,Recommended,120.7,"A masterpiece It took me around 100 hours to finish the game. The world of Rivellon is both big and alluring. It was a joy to explore every single corner of it. Each battle was challenging, fun, made me use different tactics and I never got tired of fighting. The game balances roleplaying and combat perfectly. In some RPGs the combat is fine but the story and characters are what keep you playing. However in Original Sin 1 I didn't really care for the story while Original Sin 2 kept me interested at all times. It really improves on the lore, roleplaying and combat. It's definitely a good sequel and one of the best games of 2017.  I only have two complaints: Romance had no effect on the ending and the amount of puzzles in the game. It would have taken me A LOT more than 100 hours to finish the game because of the puzzles.  Now don't get me wrong. The puzzles are all interesting and well executed. There are some simple puzzles, moderate and very hard ones. I just don't have too much time to play video games and since there are so many puzzles in the game I had to resort to using Google way more than I'd like to admit. Now the romance and with it some minor spoilers ahead. I decided to romance Lohse. At the end of the game she asked me if I would like to travel the world with her and I can't answer her. All I can do is end the conversation and in the final cutscene the narrator tells me that she spent the rest of her life traveling Rivellon alone.  Just dissapointing.  But what is the game about? What's the story like? You have the ability to use Source - A powerful and outlawed magic. Magic used by the gods themselves. It's what gives them power. The game starts with you being captured by Magisters who hunt and imprison everyone who can use Source. They take you to an isolated prison island. While there you make new friends, discover an unbelievable truth about yourself and make interesting alliances while trying to escape the island. You will meet dragons, witches, paladins, underground fighting arenas, demons, trolls, ghosts and much, much more. You will also uncover conspiracies and astonishing secrets. Will you be the new Divine?  The game itself plays alot like the recent XCOM games. It's basically a turn-based roleplaying game. Not to worry tho. You can still create a custom character and choose their stats, race, gender, and origin story or you can simply choose one of the pre-made characters. There's a wide variety of classes to choose from as well. All your favourate melee, ranged and magic classes are there. It also has Steam Workshop and modders have made some really interesting class mods that are worth checking out. However, if you enable mods you are not able to earn achivements. This, in my humble opinion, is a bit foolish. It's a singleplayer game and I should be allowed to have my fun however I want. The trainers still work and it has no leaderboards in it so I don't really support disabling achivements for mod users. It's a minor complaint but a complaint nonetheless.  The game is well optimised and ran at a solid 60 frames per second at all times. I did experience two crashes during my playthrough but other than that I really didn't notice any other bugs or issues. Visually the game is lovely to look at and the soundtrack is marvelous. Don't go into it expecting remarkable next gen graphics though.  It's a game I most definitely won't forget any time soon. I want a sequel and I want it now! A must play for every roleplaying fan and fans of the turn-based genre should give it a go as well. Well done, Larian Studios, well done. "

62,Johnny_Devo,150,86,4,"January 1, 2017",Recommended,236.1,"When I first got this game, I was immediately assaulted by an array of limiting areas, tough enemies, and hard fights, to the point where it felt like I wasn't allowed to do anything except a very strict railroad of easier enemies in order to progress. It made me start to lose faith in the game, because it seemed like there was only an illusion of freedom.  But then I got good. After floundering around in my first save file for a good few hours, I sat down and made a new character, applying everything I had learned. I made a focused character. I scrounged for every piece of armor, clawed at every possible avenue and advantage, and I applied the very tactics that destroyed me in the first playthough. It didn't take long to learn that if done right, the game is just as impossible for your enemies as it could be for you.  What I was rewarded with was knowing that there are, for example, several different ways to complete the first area. It's not a railroad; I just, to put it blunt, sucked. In fact, after discovering my first way though that beginning area... I went back in, and starting clearing out enemies, starting in order from most managable. It became an arms race of beating the lowest enemies I could find, surviving the encounter, and assimilating any loot I could find, up to and including the paintings on the walls.  Then, I come up to what I'll call ""midway"" through the first act. Suddenly things are falling into place with the plot, and I'm gaining hints of what appears to be a really neat story in the making. The varied things you can encounter kept my interest once I had the skill to progress, managing gear was interesting due to the magic armor and physical armor differences, and limited resources forced me to make interesting decisions every time I came across a nice piece of gear in a shop.  I began to learn of the various advantages and disadvantages inherent to different styles. Spreading your points can mean you have access to a ton of powerful toolbox abilities, but don't deal much damage. You can focus all your points into one aspect, and that character will be a high damage monster, but will lack in utility in comparison. Pair two such characters together, and your high damage will punch through the defenses of your victim, then the utility monster will knock them down for a turn, only to be put in the ground for good by your high damage character's second round.  Essentially, what I'm saying is if you find yourself overwhelmed by this game like I was at first, I suggest you attempt to absorb what the game is beating into you, then try to use that to beat it back into the game. If you can manage that, the varied builds and playstyles as well as the interactive battle system may just capture your attention.  Overall, this game is already something that I would consider great, and they're only in early access. They're still working on the game and the story, accepting feedback from the forums, and they're doing it well. Worth the full price now, can only get better from here. Would recommend."

First character i made ended up deleting as i got into a fight i couldn't handle, burned my revives(had no recent save).  I have talked two people into fighting to the death to settle a petty argument, had followers that have a blood feud, put out fires with raining blood, picked the pocket of my buddy online w/o him noticing, and spent 20 minutes the first time around on character creation.  I've only just hit the first city as well. . .   This game is just terrific.

73,jeep,161,48,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,75.4,"I am incredibly excited to say that this game is all that I could have asked of Larian Studios. As someone who loves Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, etc, Divinity: Original Sin 2 simply blows my mind. The dialogue can be witty, comedic, even tongue-in-cheek, but at times it is also grim, dark, and serious. Each character has their own way of coping with situations, and you as the player must work to keep the group together. You can choose the class of all of your adventurers, and tweak your main character at the start screen - in effect, you can multiclass from the get-go. Abilities synergize and can create opportunities that can be exploited by other party members - or, if you're not careful, by the enemy!   In terms of customization, the game is lovely. In summation, you can advance your character in a non-linear fashion if you so choose, but you might find it easier to create classes that are symbiotes (they benefit from each other's abilities).  In terms of audio, the game is FANTASTIC. The voice acting is wonderfully immersive, and the sound effects are well-timed and well-orchestrated. Speaking of orchestas, the soundtrack is incredible. If you don't believe me, give it a listen on YouTube. The ability to choose which instrument will play at turning points of the campaign really gives you that feeling of audio customization, and lets you feel like you are in control of every aspect of the game.  In short, I may sound like a ""yes-man"" when I wholeheartedly recommend this game. I may sound like there's nothing wrong with the game, but there are several bugs which are still unfixed and exploits that can be exposed to the savvy gamer. But, if you are like me, and you simply enjoy a game for what it has to offer (a complex storyline, diverse characters, entertaining combat, excellent audio, above-average graphics), then this game is for you!"

81,Yemeth,413,81,0,"December 15, 2017",Recommended,197.3,"You know those games that are just a few tweaks away of greatness? The original Original Sin was that kind of game.It had modernised CRPG mechanics,great combat,lots of choices on how to get on with the world,wonderful crafting yet cumbersome UI and a muddled story (even with the Enhancements later released)  Original Sin 2 tries to rectify all those mistakes. For my detailed review check this out:  http://indiannoob.in/divinity-original-sin-2-review-pc-noobreview-dungeons-dragons-and-mashed-potatoes/  +For starters, it has a more straightforward and darker storyline and writing. +The UI has been refined and is a lot more accessible +Character creation, customistaion, companions are all great. +General gameplay is still solid packing deep environmental interaction(in&out combat),fun crafting and exciting turn-based combat with good animations. +Classes are varied and many and balanced very well +Pretty much all lines are voice acted and they do a decent job.Same with the soundtrack +Challenging Tactician difficulty in which the game should be played (Normal being too easy) +Game Master mode for PnP RPG simulation and co-op is fun as always +Game looks great with a more grounded art style this time around +Mod Support   -I felt the streamlining of RPG attributes and skills from the first game is a bit of a let down (Although they allow less trial & error playthroughs) -The crafting seems to have been downplayed this time around.They have taken out the skills related to crafting and some fun recipes -Normal difficulty is way too easy,at least in the first chapter.  -Tactician mode felt cheap in some aspect like when it gives enemy ridiculous amount of physical and magical armor.In the first game,higher diffiiculty meant more enemies and smarter A.I.  TL:DR Orignal Sin 2 easily takes it's place as one of the greatest CRPGs ever along with Baldur's  Gate,Fallout,Wasteland,Planescape:Torment etc and at the same time possess mastery over it's technical aspects something the afforementioned games never did possess."
82,KRAUSER-SAMA,615,123,5,September 28,Recommended,74.7," The Short of it  Please note that everything that I write is based on my experiences with the Definitive Edition, and will also be looked at as standalone rather than compared to its predecessor.   Pros: +The world of Divinity OS 2 is vast and deep +The characters are fantastic, applies to NPCs but especially the Origin characters +An easy enough to understand combat system that possesses a great amount of depth +Absolutely stunning graphics +From the sound design to the soundtrack and especially the voice acting, it‚Äôs superb +The modding community is impressive to say the least with tons of ways to augment your experience  Cons: -...   More In-depth (Spoiler-Free)   +Story: Let‚Äôs start this off with one of DOS2‚Äôs greatest points, the story and world. While of course staying as spoiler free as possible, the game comes with an incredibly vast world for you to explore and venture through as you work towards your ultimate objective (which I‚Äôll be withholding for any prospective players interested in the game). From the main quest to the side quests, from your perspective as the protagonist to the NPCs in the game‚Äôs world, Larian has truly given thought to how they‚Äôd flesh out every area in terms of it‚Äôs lore. The greatest part of all of this is that, despite being a sequel, there's no disconnect for the player even if you having played the first. While I recommend playing both, I can assure any of you who were hesitant about diving straight into the second, it's completely alright to do so. This point on just how deep the world of DOS2 goes becomes apparent the moment you attempt to create a character and are revealed the Origin characters which I will be focusing on next.   +Origin: What is an origin character? Origin characters are a set of 6 very unique characters that already have their backgrounds integrated into the very core of the game. You can think of them as the closest thing to a preset character when thinking in terms of RPGs, but you needn‚Äôt fret, they are completely customizable on their stat spread and what class you wish to play as. I especially love these origin characters because they add an entirely new layer to what‚Äôs going on, you‚Äôre not only worrying about the current state of the world as the story tells it, but also your own circumstances. For example (very minor spoiler ahead), one of the origin characters is a red lizard with the title of ‚ÄúThe Red Prince‚Äù, born for glory yet fell from grace for ‚Äúcavorting with demons‚Äù, and on his own quest to reclaim his rightful throne. Given his position in the overall world of the game, he‚Äôs an important figure to say the least, as a result very early on in the game an assassin will make an attempt on your life. That is just a very small insight as to what DOS2 has to offer. These origin characters could each have their own stories told separately, but no, they intertwine into a much bigger tale. The amount of content you get from the narrative of this game alone is astonishing, and for that Larian Studios deserves a round of applause.  +Gameplay: Now, let‚Äôs get to the real meat of the game, shall we? How does the game play? In a word, spectacular. The game, as a CRPG, gets the job down without many issues. From traversing the various lands to engaging in combat, the game both looks and feels great. As a keyboard and mouse user at the very least I found the controls to be quite intuitive. Combat is fairly simple, you learn skills and associate those skills to your hotkey of preference, activating said skill will either require that you choose a target or a specified location (Area of Effect) which will be controlled by your mouse. Pretty simple, right? However, the battlefield is ever changing and the higher the difficulty, the more considerate you need to be of what exactly is happening and how you should react accordingly. There are many factors that can go into a fight than just slinging spells into the face of your enemy, environmentals and utility based effects can be the key to turning the tide in a battle. This may sound like rather obvious advice, but I can‚Äôt think of a CRPG that‚Äôs done it better than how Larian Studios has.  Like in D&D (where you will often hear the comparison made), the game really starts from the beginning of the game, the character creation (yeah, we‚Äôre back to good ol‚Äô character making) the distribution of your points from the beginning and how you proceed from thereafter is crucial, especially if you‚Äôre a player that wishes to challenge themselves with the highest difficulty. One particular stat in the game that I‚Äôd like to bring up in reference to this point is the ‚Äúmemory‚Äù stat. Memory is a stat that you upgrade when you wish to assign more skills to your hotbar. Learning the spell is one thing, but you can‚Äôt cast that which you haven‚Äôt ‚Äúmemorized‚Äù. As a summoner/caster hybrid of sorts I cannot tell you how much memory played a factor in how I progressed because there is such a wide variety of builds I wish to try. You can of course find a few mods to make this easier, but that‚Äôs completely player preference, I personally like the restriction otherwise I‚Äôd be a walking arsenal (which is fun in it‚Äôs own right hehe). The game is easy enough to understand but there are a number of factors that will make or break you in this game if you aren‚Äôt careful, be it in combat or otherwise.  +Graphics: Typically, a CRPG‚Äôs main concern isn‚Äôt how it looks, but DOS2 has been crafted with very special care in this regard. The environments are beautiful (in more than one sense depending on where you‚Äôre looking), the character models are fair and above all else magic possesses a special sort of impact I don‚Äôt see in other games of its genre. I‚Äôm particularly infatuated with the animations and poses performed when casting spells, the details on these animations alone are something to be in awe of.  +Sound: I must say, the sound design in this game is great given the variety of different types of skills there are to learn. In respect to the background music, in character creation, you can actually select an instrument of choice to play the soundtrack. This I found to be a very nice touch, as someone who likes his music. However, the aspect I‚Äôm truly stunned by is the voice acting. Just pure, high quality voice acting planted throughout the game for every NPC (including animals!). This is a standard I wish more games had already adopted, but we live in a world where many AAA titles still cheap out on giving certain lines any audible lines.  +Mods: The game provides a plethora of content on its own, but that‚Äôs not all the fun that‚Äôs to be had. Say hello to the world of mods if you‚Äôre playing DOS2. THe modding community for this game is incredible, there are many quality of life mods, class overhauls, or completely new classes altogether with specially made animations just for that class! Of course, that isn‚Äôt all there is to modding in this game, but I feel that those are the major ones to point out. Modding can truly enhance your experience, or extend the lifetime of this already eternal game by an unfathomable amount. If you feel bored playing a game once, even in a game with as much diversity as this, well mods will change that.    Conclusion  I could nag about the infinitesimally issues that rarely popped up here and there (like the particular position of the camera interfering with a particular action), but there‚Äôs just too much good content to talk about to even try. No matter what angle you try to look at this game from, it easily stands out from the rest and establishes itself at the top of its kind. A truly ‚Äúdivine‚Äù game.

84,Tuco,750,80,7,"November 25, 2017",Recommended,336.6,"Divinity: original Sin 2 is a strong contender to ""Game of the Year""  and with few meaningful tweaks it could easily compete to rank among the best RPGs of all time.  Like for its predecessor, its strong points are the massive amount of player agency permitted, one of the best turn-based combat systems in the business, a great degree of environmental interaction and very solid encounter design.  Disappointingly enough, this sequel fails mostly in the same area that hindered its predecessor: itemization and stat bloat. Larian's stubbornness with randomized loot over unique and hand-placed items means you'll never get rewards that are meaningful, just generic items that can drop anywhere or pop in any merchant's inventory at any given time. That kills a lot of incentives to bring down strong enemies, solve quests and explore for hidden treasures: when every action can potentially get the same outcome, it doesn't really feel like accomplishments matter that much.  On top of that, the problem with stat bloat emerges few hours into the game. While the problem presents itself from the beginning (by the time you'll get all the pieces of the first armor set in the starting area they'll be completely obsolete), it becomes genuinely grating past level 14-15, as you'll quickly get to the point where the jump in values at each level will be so ridiculous you'll literally double your HP/damage/armor values, etc. This essentially forces (well, strongly encourages) the players to replace ALL the equipment for his entire party at every level up.  That's not just annoying and a bit pace-breaking, but it also has the not irrelevant side effect to make you feel like no piece of equipment you'll find, no matter how strong at that given moment, gives you any long-term value.   There were surely better ways to handle these aspects, even just looking at the past. This game with the Baldur's Gate 2 itemization could have been a all-times classic."

The combat of this game is excellent, and - I believe - is its shining feature.  And if you think you are particularly good at it there is now even a PvP arena in DOS 2.  With that said, if you did not like DOS 1, you will probably not like DOS 2.  The game is the same formula, practically the same combat system (with a few improvements and a few setbacks), and really the same story-quality of the first game.  You might find the story a little disappointing if you bought into all the hype that Larian threw down about hiring so many writers, when really what you are looking at is pages and pages of written dialogue (no voice acting) that you will probably begin to skip through six hours into the game.  And I say that as someone who loves books (Andrej Sapkowski's Blood of Elves is sitting right next to my keyboard).  But, look on the brightside: it's still early access right?  They could improve it... well, at least we can hope.  While I certainly have enjoyed DOS 2 for its combat, graphics, and character design... the story is not going to win any awards if it stays in its current form.  If that is going to be a deal breaker for you then I suggest you wait until the game is finished and see how it is then.  But if a badass combat system is enough to draw you in, then I'll see you in the arena!  (Oh, by the way, I should mention that the lizards in this game look really, REALLY badass... and sexy. :3)"

96,"Sir Kirby, the Radio Pheasant",105,39,2,August 5,Recommended,187.2,"This game is as close to 10/10 as possible: There are plenty of encounters that play off each other, and impact that can be had from simple interactions you might not think much of. The amount of interplay from this game is absolutely amazing, and I'm almost certain you can have hundreds of hours and still miss some really small nuanced things in the game.  I came into this game never having played the first, and I still absolutely loved it. Single player is completely awesome, even if a bit more work, but if you have a group of friends to play this with? All the more awesome.  The following review is spoken without ever touching modding, or anything beyond the base campaign.  Some complaints that you should be on the lookout for: -Grasping the spell interactions can be a bit steep when starting out for mages. (For instance, you may poison your undead tank to heal them, and then hit them with a spell called Fortify which can remove your heal) -Sometimes, you can be roped into conversation with a character who isn't your pursuasion char, and then be forced to spill spaghetti and rope your team into a fight -Line of sight will 9 times out of 10 kill you, and you can only cry a single tear as the NPC sometimes snipes you through solid walls -Spell mileage will vary greatly from the player to the computer (a charmed/taunted npc may cheese out their turn, where you will seemingly always be forced to do something absolutely silly and try to kill yourself) -Whenever your characters are charmed/taunted, they *will* absolutely destroy your inventory full of consumables (though they will *always* use your rain scrolls first) -In later levels, with lots of particle effects and interactions, the computer may take quite a bit of time in deciding their turns -Sometimes, depending on how good your computer is, you can have a very unstable game -Some playstyles aren't quite viable. (For instance, a battle mage is ""possible"", but not really ideal, as you end up splitting damage over physical/magical resistance, which makes Crowd Control nigh impossible, as the real damage from physical/magical spells comes out when you are hitting their Hit Points directly) -Spirit vision (a thing that lets you talk with ghosts) is great from a lore perspective, but it can be easy to forget how versatile it is if you're not actively thinking about it; and if you're actively thinking about it, you pretty much have to spam it and walk across the world hoping you don't miss a fun little lore tid-bit. -Some fights are just straight up brutal if you don't quite know what's going on, all I can say is don't be afraid to google a bit of help if you're really struggling  Despite the complaints above, those really are just minor inconvinences which you'll have from time to time. Think of them like speedbumps in the middle of a really awesome racetrack. Like, you can't deny the rest of the racetrack how awesome it is, though you sometimes wish you could run it without the speedbumps. (Fingers crossed that some grievances will be removed in the Enhanced Edition) Pros: -After the initial learning curve, you basically get to sit back and relax and explore an amazingly intricate world of well written, well voiced, beautifully animated and beautifully built NPCs and the world they live in. -You get a lot of self-insertion capability, either playing the righteous hero, or scourge of the land.

You have the Pin system for the Zone Map but if we could do smaller temporary local Pings that would be super helpfull, or have the ability to draw fading lines on the minimap or on the ground.

99,Narayan,698,32,4,February 8,Recommended,172.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a true modern cRPG. Instead of just emulating the Infinity Engine itself, it preserves the old school soul and complexity, includes all the things you would expect from ye olden days, adds many positive surprises on top of it, then frames them into amazing shiny 3D visuals with functional UI and tons of convenience. Even though there is number 2 in the title, it can be played as a standalone game without prior knowledge of the previous OS, or others in the Divinity series.  The game world is just packed with stuff to do - every few steps you bump into something new happening. And that‚Äôs above and below ground, as the game features quite a lot of caves, dungeons, ancient ruins, cellars, and even a pocket universe. The player has always plenty options to chose from how to proceed. Abilities like persuasion or lockpicking are really useful, and talking to animals is just awesome. The story is serious in tone, with many mature subplots, but it‚Äôs not lacking some needed moment to moment humor either (usually when doing side missions, not as unnecessary comic relief to main line). There are many memorable characters & situations. The companions are great and well fleshed out, each of them quite distinct. Their stories often intertwine with the main plot, so they all feel relevant.  While the game is fantasy in nature, and there are plenty of things we‚Äôre used to, there are also many quirks and ideas unique only to this world. Enough for it to feel fresh most of the time.  It‚Äôs not perfect though (but close). There are limits to what you can do, although there is very high chance you'll be able to execute most plans you come up with. The pacing was a little weird as well - the 2nd area with Driftwood was just too huge and not particularly structured. They might have been aiming at more open feel after the initial island, but it just turned out to be tiring by the end of it, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of there. I‚Äôm aware that if I wasn‚Äôt a person hell bent on scouring every inch of the map, and doing absolutely everything, I might feel otherwise, but that‚Äôs just the way I like to play, so that part didn‚Äôt mesh well with my game style. I had to take a break a bit after that, but later areas, Nameless Isle and Arx were great again :)   Part of that issue might have been due to combat, there was just too much of it for my taste. The combat at first is quite confusing, since many useful skills are too spread out between different lines, and it introduces some new concepts like surfaces. Then you get the hang of it, and it‚Äôs fun for some time, and later on you get overwhelmed by sheer amount if it. There are many epic fights all right, but at the same time, even though I appreciated the variety and scope of them, sometimes I just wanted to get it over with and progress a bit faster (turn based battles can take a while).  But overall D:OS2 is simply outstanding. Highly recommended :)  Written after 173 hours played & 84 of 97 (87%) achievements earned. "
100,Grant,376,69,3,September 3,Recommended,114.0,"I will try to keep this review short and sweet.  Generally speaking - I am not a fan of turn based games. I prefer real time RPG Combat found in games like Skryim, Fallout, and Witcher 3 (The GOAT).   With that being said, even with it not being my favorite combat method, this game is INCREDIBLE. The story and choice making you can make is very similar to Fallout : New Vegas, where each dialogue matters and has an impact.   In terms of replayability, you can choose across multiple ""Origin"" characters, who all have deep back stories and the ability for you to influence the future on a very large scheme.   If you like RPGs where you get to make choices, this ranks up in the top 3 for me, which are Fallout : New Vegas, Witcher 3, and Divinity : Original Sin 2.   If you've taken the time to read this entire review, take the plunge and invest the time in this game, because it is insanely good."

105,Sarlic,335,43,0,"September 18, 2016",Recommended,152.5,"EDIT:  Below this edit is the original review I made during Early Access. Currently I would have to say 100% of my issues with the game in the early access were addressed even before the release. The AI has been improved to the point they make choices a skilled player may make. The Mass AP issue has been entirely resolved. The issue with certain skills not being balanced as in Hailstorm, Single Dagger and others have all been rebalanced and made entirely fair.   To add to this they have outdone themselves by adding FULL voice acting in the game, something that was only in the first one after the enhanced edition. The mechanics for the undead are entirely fleshed out. The storyline is entirely fluid and fleshed out. I can honestly say this game has not only met but exceeded my every expectation is entirely justified in its price for the quality put into it. Larion Studios has released a game that shows what EARLY ACCESS should be used for and it's benefits. I whole heartedly look forward to their next game.  EARLY ACCESS ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'll start by saying that I am well aware it's early access so some features are clearly not available as of yet.  The game is indeed an improvement overall to the first game, the combat is more fluid and challenging however I do see an issue in the fact the AI seemingly has collosal amounts of AP and can walk halfway across the field and still attack. This was an issue in the first game as well though and not a fault in D:OS2.  Even the very first goal of chapter one can be suceeded in so many ways including simple brute force if you happen to be a tactical genius. The added Highground vs Lowground bonus/penalty for ranged attacks in a great addition as it adds other dimension to the tactics in combat.   My greatest complaint is really just a matter of not being able to test out the true customization of the character classes. I also admit that the first town in D:OS seemed to have so much more to do but I do enjoy the more serious and adult approach of D:OS2.  All in all I genuinely believe the game is worth picking up, not necessarily saying people should buy it now at full price but it will definitely be a game worth playing with your friends. Albeit a very unforgiving game."
106,Sgt. Steak,122,79,5,June 11,Recommended,147.6,"ForenoteI apologize if this review doesn't appear as crisp as others on this page, as I don't write them often. That said, I feel this is one that absolutely warrants doing so. I'll attempt to spare you copious amounts of gushing in favor of clearer, more concise points as I go, though you should be aware that I've always had a weakness for games like this. Your mileage, as it will in all things, may vary.   Positives Craftsmanship: Excellent! Clear attention to detail and passion funneled into worldbuilding. There is a lot to see, hear and learn in Rivellon, and you'd be amazed at where and from whom this knowledge comes from.   Character depth: Glaringly flawed in some areas, but otherwise great! Whether pre-built avatars or enlisted as companions in the game itself, the game's cast of characters is unique and brimming with their own motives, thoughts and ideas. Likewise, those you do take with you aren't just along for the ride, and will actively attempt to make an impact on your adventure.  Nuance and Build Variety: Excellent! Anything is possible (within some very loose limitations) provided you're willing to work to put it together.  Gameplay: Good! Turn-based strategy type combat similar in nature to XCOM, with some departures in the form of such things as character-specific initiative. Larian's systems have a few issues, though, and a fair number of them can be really, really frustrating to deal with.  Story: Great! Not the most amazing story I've experienced, but definitely worth the time. It doesn't pull punches, and if nothing else, it is profoundly immersive.  Graphics: Excellent! Far above and beyond what is often expected of this genre, and despite the abundance of particle effects and bodies on screen, it runs smoothly to boot.  Soundtrack: Fair! Nothing to write home about, sadly. It can absolutely set up a mood, but it never struck me as anything I'd carry with me beyond the game itself. Negatives Equality of Companion Storytelling: Not every character was written equal, and it shows. Some have little to no impact on the story overall, while others quite literally change the perspective of everything going on. Taking those that land in the former category invariably trades interesting character dialogue, interations and bonding for what has the potential to be some of the more interesting tid-bits about the lore, important figures and what-not.  Gameplay: Inconsistent autosave mechanic makes it easy to lose hours of progress if you're not particular about saving over and over again. Items acquired during that lost time are not guaranteed to exist upon a reload, nor will they have the same stats as the game rerolls everything you do not presently own each time you reload. Initiative can be annoying and it creates opportunities for more powerful enemies to murder a member or members of your party before you can even act, if you aren't careful.  'Endgame': I feel no shame in admitting Divinity's stronger moments are in its first half, where you're getting to know the world and the people you're traveling with. A lot of crazy, fantastical things happen, but it all serves to further motivate you to seek out the real and honest truth. Sadly, however, a lot of the payoff isn't quite as stellar as I was hoping it'd be. In an effort to keep from spoiling anything, I'll clip this bullet with: Some of the final decisions can feel a little forced, and as resolutions approach, it becomes painfully obvious that, as above, not all companions and characters were written equal. Overall Divinity, in spite of what are ostensibly minor flaws (with the exception of some of the story-related notes), is a game that I wholeheartedly reccomend if you're a fan of the top-down dungeon crawler/RPG style of game. It has a lot of heart, and the world is very well put together. While there are some inconsistencies, some painfully overt 'nyah nyah' moments with the game's villains, and a general undertone of slight predictability to its story, it pulled me in and got me hooked on all the little details it had to offer. My only major gripe from a roleplaying standpoint is how... well, for lack of a better word, weak some of the resolutions are. At best, it can feel a little forced and at worst, some of the endings to several of the arcs in my playthroughs struck me as outright betrayals of everything that had been built up. In an effort to avoid spoilers (beyond what little I already have), this is something best experienced and decided in person.   As for gameplay, Divinity offers a rather open-ended system that can be tweaked and paired in a vast number of ways. It helps keep combat engaging, and it offers a great deal of replayability, as there are always new ways to try tackling different situations. That said, it has some very serious flaws that I found somewhat stifling, not the least of which being encounters with tougher enemies with a party that wasn't solidly invested in high initiative scores. Others, such as strange inconsistencies with line of sight, action points and other integral mechanics were certainly noticeable, but hardly game-breaking. Not much of a change from the first game there, I'm afraid.  In all, I'd rate this a 4/5. I would have been comfortable paying more than its asking price for the experience I got."

108,Dank Knight,397,89,5,February 2,Recommended,184.4,"NOTE:This is my experience after 45 hours into the game on Tactician difficulty, mostly solo. So the review is subject to changes.  PROS: (Oh boi, where do I begin from) +Looks very good visually and boasts equally good music. +Deep character customisation and progression. +Complex, intricate systems that let you experiment and even break the game. This lends to a lot of player freedom and agency. +Staggering attention to detail. +Quests are plenty and missable. There are multiple approaches and outcomes to every quest. +Chaotic, tactical combat along with clever AI scripting +The amount of replayability is off the charts! This is one game which requires multiple runs to experience everything.  CONS:-Some UI issues, where I had to click on a combat skill multiple times for the game to register it. A minor nitpick.  VERDICT:Simply put, Divinity Original Sin 2 IS the best role-playing game that makes The Witcher 3 look like a generic open-world title. What you get is an impossibly interactive game world where every action seems possible, and has consequences with such a level of complexity and flexibility it‚Äôs difficult to believe it exists, let alone that it could ever be bettered.  Its scope can be intimidating, but not overwhelming, and there‚Äôs usually a way to fix a mistake.  And it‚Äôs that intimidating, ambitious scope, that dedication to player freedom, that makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so impressive.  There isn‚Äôt another game right now that lets you do so much.   This is an easy 10/10. Buy it, play it and fall in love with RPG's all over again."

114,Darxim,122,34,2,"November 16, 2016",Recommended,498.8,"[Updating review from Early Access]  Almost all of the negative reviews of this game remark that they gave negative review for one of two reasons: 1. Game has too many bugs. 2. Game is too difficult.  That first one is fair.  There are a lot of bugs.  I'm currently not actively playing it due to this.  With this game's ambitious scope, bugs are expected.  Although, relative to a Bethesda game, this game was practically bug-free at release.  The second point, however, is just stupid.  tl;dr: It's not.  When you start the game, you choose your difficulty.  If Tactician is too hard for you, play Classic.  If Classic is too hard for you, play Explorer.  If Explorer is too hard for you, I'm surprised you're able to operate a computer at all.  I started one game on Explorer just to find something out that I couldn't where I was in my game (it was crafting related), and I was killing most things in one hit.  How is this difficult for you?  Honestly, I think it's just people playing on Tactitican because they think they're awesome, then get their asses handed to them because they're not.  I've seen people claim that Act 1 is impossible on Tactician.  Keep in mind that people had already beaten the entire game on Tactician when these claims were made.  If you want an easy game, I would say that this game is not for you, but Explorer mode is available, and it is a really good game, so you should probably still play it.  Another complaint I've seen, although it's rare, is about the level bloat.  I agree with this complaint.  There is way too big a difference between one level and the next, and the steepness of the curve makes it a lot worse.  The game would be a lot better without it.  I can understand the power increase from leveling being on a curve, as that's normal, but the curve is too damn high."

It refines and improves almost everything from the original Divinity: Original Sin. The attention to detail, environments, quests, voice acting, combat, etc are all fantastic. The addition of multiplayer is absurdly fun and just the sheer variety the game offers is something else entirely.

Only 2 writers for Divinity Original Sin, there's triple that for this and voicing the game would take years. Conversations feel a lot more in depth too and I found myself voluntarily reading it as opposed to just skipping, which is what I ended up doing on Original Sin (not that it was boring, I loved the voice acting, just got very tedious in my opinion). Worth the money tbh, I am very proud to know that I am supporting Larian Studios on this journey. If you haven't got DOS2 and have been thinking about it for a while, it's worth it."
123,federated state of trollnesia,158,80,5,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,51.7,"Some pretty severe balancing problems really hurt this game on the harder difficulties at the moment I write this review. It definitely seems like melee-heavy parties are not very viable. I've restarted three times now and reduced my party's melee investment with each restart and I've been progressively enjoying the combat more as a result. Basically, melee at least so far in the first act, do not have mobility skills they need to do anything. Attacks of opportunity require a trait investment, which is kind of lame. It doesn't help armored enemies mitigate a lot of melee damage and that getting magic resistance as a fighter is difficult, resulting in a lot of annoying CC from numerous enemies.  I've had to cheese a lot of my fights to win them (abusing conversation mechanics mostly) and it feels kind of bad.  The game is still fun, but I would advise doing research about party composition before investing a lot of XP.  Also, this game commits a lot of ""cardinal sins"" for me: 1. Persuading people down from fights...results in a net XP loss and no notable change in the story's outcome (at least so far); as far as I can tell, being a murderous bastard is the best way to play this (by far, even). Aside from meager barter prices I don't see a point in making a charismatic character. 2. You're encouarged to fight and kill trash for XP; at multiple parts in the first act instead of advancing the story like I wanted to, I was compelled to scour the area for more things to kill. If you like this, then this is the game for you. Reminds me a lot of Baldur's Gate in that regard. 3. Some party members, if you don't keep them on a short leash, will break quests for you by doing naughty things to NPCs. 4. Quests break...and there's no notification about it. It's basically a missing thread. It's kind of interesting this way, leaving you to figure out how to resolve the quest, but if there's no way to resolve it, you'll never know for sure. So be careful when you go murdering people who might be connected with a quest. This is definitely preferable over Skyrim's ""everyone is invulnerable"" bullcrap, but I'd like to know when I've royally ruined everything and should reload. 5. A lot of game mechanics aren't forshadowed at all (one of the early fights has turtles which...explode for a ton of damage when you kill them, really great surprise when you have a lot of melee in your party) and you'll be reloading after you experience them. 6. Numerous boss weapon drops so far for me have been inferior to standard stuff I find in shops. It's funny (not in a way I like), this one notable enemy I killed dropped a dagger which had a ""10% bleed chance"" mod on it - and that was supposed to be the draw for me using it I guess? In a turn based strategy game, ""10% anything"" might as well as not be there. There are a lot of other lukewarm mods on gear that might as well not be there or do anything. I've been vendoring a lot of stuff. 7. Gold isn't super abundant, so you will be picking up pots, pans, and kitchen sinks to make by. I've never liked this as it's just absolutely silly and tedious.   Depsite my gripes, this is definitely a solid RPG and tactics game, at least the most of what we can expect from 2017."

I always enjoy how this game allows for so many ways to deal with certain situations.  I liked the new physical/magical armor system. The only thing I wish was that they had made it easier to know what items combined to do what.  I felt like I was missing out on how the crafting system worked. Also I'm not sure on this Source pt system.  Granted you do not get much access to it till the end of Act 1 but I'm hoping this won't be something that is finite in the game.  I like to use the high level moves in combat more often,"
128,Prime,180,26,0,"October 20, 2017",Recommended,119.1,"This game made me excited to play games again. I love it, 10/10. Okay, maybe not. Assigning a number score is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing useless anyway. I will just be critical of this game and probably talk more about the things I dislike as opposed to the things I do, everyone has already gushed enough about this game. I think it is one the best RPGs of this generation, but it's not perfect.  Extremely open ended, with lots of possible ways to approach a given objective (encounter/quest etc.) which opens up a lot of possible playstyles/roleplay choices. This however, does introduce a lot of broken sh*t, the quest log being one glaring example and I have broken a few enounters by doing X when I should have done Y first  for some arcane reason .  Characters are well written, although all the fantasy cliches are there, they are subversive to those tropes in places and each main character has a nicely rounded theme/character arc. Writing in general is nuanced and mature, serious in tone but not lacking in humour a la classic Larian. Main Quest has some interesting ideas and dynamics, but kinda falls apart by the end of act 3 imo  (Act 3 feels very endgame, only for the main villian to pull out a dues ex machina 'lolz gotcha!', only played up to the begining of act 4, so who knows, might redeem itself in the end)    Combat is a little different from Original Sin 1 because of the inclusion of the Armour system. It prevents turn 1 CC deciding battles, and I think it makes you think a bit more tactically during the initial turns but overall I think the system needs some improvements as your mindset going into each battle remains mainly the same, and it also makes some builds pretty trash (tanks, phys/ele hybrids etc). I like saving throws in D&D, a hybrid system where, for example, armour values influenced saving throws would work better imo.  I am not a fan of the character development, way too much number creep (going to the next levels means each piece of gear is instantly outclassed), gear isn't really that intersting, just get some +stats and maybe a free non-unique skill. Vitality/armour/damage scale way too high and picking stats comes down picking whatever gives you the damage multipliers for your skills. Not really engaging or meaningful. Thankfully these points can be easily solved by using mods, but mods don't influence my opinion on the design philosophy of the base game.  Tactician mode is kinda busted, maybe I need to git gud, maybe my fun Nice BuildsTM do not abuse mechanics enough. Classic mode gets too easy, too quickly. Woe is me.  Mods pls fix   Overall though, this is on par with some of the best in the genre, and Larian should be commended for their ethical kickstarter/development process. The director has alluded to extra content in the future and has admitted to some flaws so thumbs up again."

130,rick.activemd,166,51,2,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,174.3,"So I feel I have enough information to give a well-informed review now that I'm 36.2 hours in. I've been reading, however, that if you haven't left the island yet, you are still in the tutorial! Immediate kudos for a content-packed game.  Having played the original Divinity tile from 2002, I've seen this game develop from a Diablo-esque point-and-click action RPG to the turn-based strategy game that is now Divine Divinity: Original Sin 2. Although I've missed a game or two since then, I wasn't quite sure what the storyline was, but the game clearly helps you understand what's been going on in the world of Rivellon right from the start. The immediate immersion into the game has the amazing quality to have me asking questions and wanting to seek out the answers to those questions. I was compelled to keep playing as I see the story unfold and each decision leads to more tangled pieces of the web of mystery that I need to solve.  The combat was easy to figure out immediately and I have to give Larian Studios another amazing pat on the back for integrating Full Controller Support for a turn-based isometric RPG. One of my big turn-offs is that, although I've played for keyboard and mouse combo for many years, I like my gamepad much better and will not buy any titles that don't support it.  There's some dispute about the Tactician mode and whether or not it's too hard. Having played 8 hours in Tactician mode, I finally discovered that if I wanted to enjoy the game and be able to progress in it, that I would have to play in Classic mode. Even in Classic Mode, the fights are still difficult and I've had to play a few of those, get killed multiple times, go level up my characters and improve my gear, and then finally win. Sometimes winning just barely with half my party killed.  The character creation was a little strange from most RPGs I've played, since you aren't really locked into a particular class and you can be whatever you want, based on the allocation of your Talents and Skills. I chose to play as origin character Ifan ben-Mezd, since I wanted to find out more about the storyline and how people fit into it. The build-selection during character creation made it easy to figure out what Skills and Talents were appropriate for the style of play you wanted for your main character. I always choose a good combination of melee and magic, so Battlemage was perfect for me.  Character dialogues have an added flair to them that give you extra choices based on certain tags you have or aquire or choices specific to certain origin characters.  The voiceovers are amazing and abundant, even down to having your own personal narrator. Many RPGs don't put that level of artisitic detail into their games when it comes to audio choices.  The environment is beautifully rendered and I enjoy it in full 4K resolution on my 65in. television. Full camera control with zoom in and out makes the environment easy to navigate.  Overall notes about Divinity: Original Sin 2:  * Content-packed (packed like it could rival the amount of content in Skyrim) * Mysterious and interesting storyline that makes you want to keep playing * Combat system is easy to figure out, but beware of Tactician Mode (was too hard for me) * Full Gamepad Support in a turn-based RPG (a rare find...I would play Tyranny if it had  Gamepad support) * Detailed voiceovers and soothing soundtrack * Great-looking environment that scales well to 4K resolutions  I hope this review helps someone!"

134,Tamaster,561,40,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,234.5," Review - Divinity: Original Sin 2  ===   RATING: 9.5 / 10 Legendary. There is no other word for it.   Overview Divinity Original Sin 2 (from now DOS2) is the second installment of the Original Sin saga, developed by Larian Studios first time a couple years ago. Veteran RPG makers as they are, they come a long way since they made the first Divine Divinity back in the early 2000's, and also the following chapters which all were good games (No, Beyond Divinity never existed, shhh). DOS2 is a real time RPG with turn based combat, with some new twists in the classic mechanics to keep it modern.  ===   Gameplay Analysis   General Gameplay  There is so much to say about the gameplay of DOS2, there really is. First of all, the thing that astonished me the most among all the good ones, which are really a lot, is the incredible freedom given to the player in all his actions and interactions with NPCs and eventual co-op players alike. The freedom DOS2 offers is as close as it can get to pen-and-paper RPG level of freedom transported in a videogame: every NPC is killable, everything can be stolen, companions will react on what you do based on their alignement and may even become your enemies (and so can do players you fplay with in multiplayer!), there are a myriad of different dialogue options suitable for any alignment you might want to role-play about, unique dialogues for each of the story NPCs, unique race-based ones, unique background-based ones, reputation based ones... so i mean, there are so many unique combinations and things that can happen that every play-through will be very different as far as interactions go, it's all about what you do and who you are, in this Larian did a wonderful job and very few other RPGs ever have been at the same level of depth in interactions.  Other than this, gameplay is pretty much straightforward and like any other classic RPG: explore a very vast world composed of 3 huge areas, plus all the dungeons and secret places of course, loot from randomly generated pieces of gear (except unique ones, those are always the same), fight a good variety of enemies each with its own features, and mind you enemies are very different from one another in this game so you will have to use new strategies a lot, solve quests in various ways depending on your alignment of just on how you feel like doing, but remember everything has some consequences.  If i was to explain in detail all the gameplay, this would be a very very long review and would go over the Steam word limit, so i tell you this: there have maybe been 2-3 RPGs in the whole history that match the depth this one offers, don't miss it.    Combat System  Combat in DOS2 is turn based and very much classic style. Every character starts with a fixed AP number each turn (excluding buffs and debuffs of course) and they are used for both movement and actions. There is no Mana in Divinity OS2, just cooldowns for all skills, and for some, a special type of energy is required.  The new mechanics Larian decided to introduce in OS2 are mainly about how armor works: in DOS2 there are two types of armor, Magical and Physical, which act like additional health bars and nullify any debuff or damage from that specific source (magical armor counters magical damage and magical debuffs, and so on) as long as it has 1 point at least. Once an Armor is depleted it can be regenerated with some skills and potions, but while down, Debuffs and negative statuses will always afflict the targeted character, there is no such thing as success percentage, it just matters if you have still Armor or not. The elimination of RNG this way is a quite clever gameplay change, but also comes with some issues we will discuss further on.  Other than that, rest assured, there are plenty of skills and fighting schools for all tastes, from warriors to healers to summoners, there are something like 150+ skills around to build your very custom characters the way you want.    Content  Immense. There is no way you can do everything in one play-through, you will have (and want to) play this game multiple times to get all the interactions, quests, and so on. To make just one play it can very well require above 85 hours, to complete the game 100%, can require more than 200.     Balancing  There just is one but quite serious issue with balancing: based on how the Armor mechanic is structured, it is logical to think that a party basing all its damage on either Physical or Magical would defeat enemies much quicker than splitting damage between example, 2 magical and 2 physical characters. And it is exactly how it is: a party based on just 1 type of damage is much more efficient, maybe too much, in combat and can defeat most enemies with much more ease than a ""standard"" party with some magical and some physical damage.    Challenge  Tactician difficulty, the hardest, is a serious challenge if taken without the proper respect. Badly built parties will be wiped with ease and requires planning, strategy in combat and experience. Some fights really impressed and got me on the brink of madness, let me tell you, and i play RPGs since twenty years! Luckily the unlimited and free re-spec at your base and adjustable difficulty will make the game beatable even for the less experienced.  ===   Technical Analysis   Graphics  Environments and art of cutscenes are really well done. Bear in mind this game does not make graphics one of its priorities, still the visuals are quite stunning in certain environments, particle effects are well done, character models are alright, armor and weapon models are made with particular care.  The world on DOS2 is vibrant and alive, the ccharacterization of the various environments and locations is marked very distinctively, it all contributes to the immersion feeling you already get from the roleplaying part.    Sound  It is to mention that Larian decided to voice act EVERY SINGLE DIALOGUE of this game, and there are a monstrous quantity. The voice acting is also good. This alone is a huge plus. other than this, the music and sound effects are at very good standards for an RPG, no really, they are good.    Performance  Performance is alright, the game is optimized well enough but can become heavy for low to mid end machines because it renders and makes all the characters in a whole area work together at the same time so it requires some computing power some machines might not have to run everything smooth.  Also when saving the game has some inexplicably huge frame drops.    Stability  DOS2 is not really unstable, it crashes sometimes, it is bound to happen, but rarely. There are no particular stability problems.    AI  Enemy AI is one of the best i've ever seen around. They will execute complex maneuvers to get the most efficiency out of just about everything. Think of this: enemies will get shoulder attacked to walls to avoid being back-stabbed if they are supports or ranged units and there is a rogue in the enemy team. How often you see this? Never. This is the level of AI i'm talking about, the same AI that curses you with healing is damage to bypass your shield and kill you with your own healing the next turn.  Prepare to be impressed.    Quality of Life  Inventory management and interfaces are generally good, but one thing is really bad: picked up new items will constantly clutter your hotbar and having to always clean it is a chore... there is a mod that solves this (blessed modding!) but as far as the vanilla game goes this is an issue.    Bugs / Issues  Sometimes enemies will just get stuck in combat if the pathfinding becomes too complex or if they are teleported / thrown / whatever in locations they cannot walk down from. In Act 3 some voice lines and dialogues are broken and do not work properly."

140,Shit Stain,441,19,0,"January 25, 2017",Recommended,83.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 improves on almost everything gameplay wise from the first game.  No longer do you have to deal with unfair elemental damage and debuffs that one-shot you, instead there's a new armour system that blocks this kind of damage more reliably, both physical and magical. This new system makes it so you manipulate the battlefield to your advantage more so than just spamming out CC spells on the enemies.  Combat is a lot smoother as they are both extremely aggressive but at the same time tactical as you aim your attacks. With the new armour system you will rely more on throwables and the environment to lower the opponents armour so that you can start controlling them with stuns or burning them.  A new addition are dialogue checks which are similar to the checks present in old isometric Fallout games where your statistics determine your ability to have a successful persuasion chance. Be careful who you use to talk to certain NPCs as now the checks are decided by your main stats and not only your persuasion stat.  Now the game is out of early access I really have to commend Larian for creating a fantastic game. They changed a few of the early fights so that they aren't too broken but at the same time switching it up enough to still make it challengeing. The new additions of polymorph skills and generous placement of source as well as tons of crafting recipes really shows Larian's commitment to making an amazing game.  Never before have I marveled at the magnificence and brilliance of an RPG as much as Divinity: Original Sin 2.  The freedom, progression, story and overall game mechanics makes this one of the best games I've ever played."

That's how much I looked forward to the game and I have to say, its the best purchase ever.   I usually wait for a discount before buying the game but this one is without a doubt WORTH the price tag. This game may seem overwhelming at first but that's what makes it sooo much fun in my opinion. Its what brings replayablitiy to the game. The glorious and satisfying combat just makes you want to keep coming back for more. There's nothing like freezing a puddle and then have Ifan trip over it. GODWOKEN DAMNIT IFAN!

I use no hyperbole when I say this is the best RPG I've played thus far.   Pros   Fantastic score. Whether it be running around Fort Joy, taking in the sights on the Lady Vengeance, or amid an intense battle, the music sticks with you all the way through. I've been listening to some tracks repeatedly since first hearing them.   One of the deepest RPGs in terms of choice. A task such as escaping an island ends up having a plethora of options for you to achieve your goal. Want to sneak through a secret dungeon guarded by fire slugs? Sure why not. Want to get out simply by taking a boat? Go for it! Oh what's that? You want to cheat the system and simply teleport yourself and party into various edges until you manage your way out? You got it!   Wonderfully engaging story; filled with plenty of characters that are hard to forget. Don't forget the pet pal perk to talk to all of those animals around you! (Beware, you will be sad a lot of times talking to them.) Off put by the concept of reading a ton of dialogue? (Why are you buying this...) then worry not! Every single character (and animal) is fully voiced with some amazing VO work. However, the story did let me down in a few small ways, but I'll get to that soon.   Mods mods mods! The community has been excellent at coming up with some very inventive and fun mods to use throughout your adventure. Anything from new classes, new spells, revamping certain systems, and if you're a glutton for punishment - mods that make the game even harder. Cons  Remember how I mentioned how amazing the story was? Yeah, well that‚Äôs for the majority! As some others have mentioned, going into the final act and ending, there are some definite inconsistencies with the quality of writing and apparently attention to lore. (I've never played any other Divinity games;  I was unaware until doing further research.) For a game that boasts such a wide range of choices and how they really matter; the ending(s) seemed largely basic and almost unrelated to your adventures throughout the game.   Technical problems. Any game of this size will be bound to suffer from some technical issues, I completely get that. Overall, it was nothing major - apart from one game breaking bug I encountered causing some invisible enemies to 1 hit KO me, but luckily, I had a save from not long before that I managed to get back to and the problem seemed to have fixed itself. While the bugs weren't outright angering - in the final act I did find myself getting increasingly peeved by the buildup of several small bugs affecting my experience. At times enemies will take AGES to take their turn - leaving you to simply sit there and watch them and their idle animation until they finally realize they should be doing something.    Tech probs cont. The camera and reticule would at times completely spaz out and throw itself in a random direction and would continue to do so whenever trying to target certain areas or enemies. This may have been due to some mods interfering with the code, but at times my journal would be completely wiped of all data - leaving me to have to remember what quests I still needed to do.   Balance issues. Exploring the various locales sometimes leads you into areas where you are WOEFULLY unprepared or situations that unless you had prior knowledge, are borderline impossible to defeat. While it didn't bug me too much, I frequently encountered some dialogue/enemies that upon entering the fight would instant kill my party, use the same skill numerous times with seemingly no cooldown like the heroes, or somehow know exactly the best way to take out a party member. (Did I mention I was playing on explorer? The 'easiest' mode of them all) In the end though, I loved this game and every single minute I put into it. Some problems did irk me enough to slightly lower my score, but ultimately, I'm marking this game down as one of my favorite RPGs of all-time.  9.5/10"
146,Ethrin,894,51,3,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,68.6,"I'm still working my way through the introduction of the game (haven't gotten past the first city), but so far I'm loving it! I'm playing on the Classic difficulty, and there are two difficulties higher than this one.  My characters are now level 7, but this is still an early review, as I have yet to complete act 1.  Pros: 1.) Combat is incredibly tactical. There have been a couple of fights where I got my butt handed to me because I didn't think to exploit the terrain or the destructibles placed in the battlefield.  Height matters a lot more in this game, especially if you have a huntsman. 2.) Oddly, the soundscape is amazing.  Walking through town you can hear the bustling of people walking around. It sounds great when you're in a dungeon, along the beach, and everywhere.   3.) Voiceovers, world building, and characters has been spot on so far.  I have found some characters to be really funny, and others to be incredibly intriguing, such as Losche. 4.) The game doesn't prevent you from doing things out of order.  Once you escape from Fort Joy, it really opens up and allows you to wander around the map in any direction.   Cons: 1.) Don't get me wrong, the UI is pretty well done in this game.  However, there are some UI'isms that I would like improved.  Such as being able to send all of my ""wares"" to one character (who has the highest bartering skill).   2.) Saved game bloat bug.  Right now there is an issue with saved games getting extremely bloated to the point where it can take a long time for my computer to upload the saved games to the cloud.    Closing Thoughts: This is definitely a CRPG that has had a lot of love and time put into it.  It will ask a lot of you (time wise) to get going, but so far, it has been a really enjoyable ride!  I definitely recommend it so far, and I will update as I get further into the game.  EDIT: Updated with some more pros and cons.

I hope the devs include a quest marker for individual quests rather than marking all the quest waypoints on the map together.

153,Halwin,838,156,5,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,190.5,"C'mon, become Overwhelmingly Positive already! While at the time of writing this review, I haven't even gotten past the first Act yet, I nevertheless feel compelled to write a review for this beautiful game. For me the game's highlight is its excellently designed turn-based combat. There are no potentially pesky RNG elements and therefore every fight follows the same strict rules allowing you to have full control over how every battle plays out. There's also an insane amount of skills that are open to each and every character, and free to combine at your leisure (half of the fun is simply experimenting!). While the game is very very challenging (in a good and fair way!), I never felt the need to look up guides as with some thought you are more than able to compose your own diverse team of heroes (except maybe on hard difficulty - but don't play that until you finished Classic!). The voice acting is also superb, with tons and tons of spoken dialogue and different choices you can make. Also initiating a dialogue with another of your team members may open up a whole different story which may reveal more of the character you are interacting with or the world around you. Finally, the graphics look more than impressive enough considering the game's genre, and the level design has nothing to complain about.  Admittedly, no game is without its flaws though and I will summarise my, minor, grievances here. Inventory management is still a hassle. It's a common issue for RPGs, and I'm not sure if there ever will be a game that's perfect in that regard, but with four party members, switching items to and fro, out and in of backpacks and the like, becomes a considerable hassle. Especially when it can be hard to discern between quest items, crafting materials, fluff, and junk. To add to that, civic skills like bartering and lucky charm (increases your chance to find rare items with that player only) are not group-wide, meaning that you will have to switch items (and gold) to and fro your characters yet again to reap the maximum gold and good gear. Frankly, I don't bother with the last two because it's a serious nuisance, and it doesn't really make the game too hard without. Nevertheless a fix to this inconvenience would be appreciated. Furthermore, certain skills are either useless - initiative: determines the play order during a fight for your team only, meaning that having one at 13, then 12, 11, 10 is sufficient and any extra points are basically lost, - or certain skills provide odd bonuses - warfare: a melee oriented skill that apparantly is the best damage increase for rangers as well (I do have a ranger in my team with 5 huntsman and 0 warfare however, and he's perfectly viable on Classic. I only need to make sure he's positioned with a height advantage, which is actually how the game intended rangers to be played). Last, but not least, there's no way to change party members during a conversation, meaning that if you are forced into a dialogue (probably because he/she was closest to the conversation starter) with someone and a persuasion check needs to be passed, it is impossible to have your player with skill in pursuasion take it over (this led to frequent quickloads for me). Basically during dialogue your team members turn into mutes unless they are scripted to take part in the conversation.   I didn't intend for the second paragraph to be longer than the first, and I would recommend to pay more focus to the great things this game offers rather than the minor nuisances. I will give this game a higher rating once some (or all) of these issues are addressed, which I actually expect they will.   TL;DR: A must buy even at full price! It currently has the well deserved spot of #10th best game ever!  P.S. Feel free to reply to this review with questions; I usually reply rapidly. Also, if you decided to buy the game after reading this I'd be happy to help you out with the game, or play with you co-op if our times align! :)  Rating: 9.0/10 Halwin's 100% Completion RecommendationDifficulty: Unsure, but considering honour mode achievement I expect 9/10. Time: Expect it to be easily 150+ hours  Will update this section once I have completed the game."

159,applekwisp,332,25,3,"December 14, 2017",Recommended,101.0,"Great RPG, probably one of the best games of 2017. It's strengths lie in an amusing colorful world, with and intresting, serious, yet lighthearted fantasy setting. The game is actually very rough around the edges the longer you play. It's polish runs out in the last 2 chapters as they feel rushed and maybe even unfinished. The difficulty curve of the game feels off since near the start it's very challenging, but towards the end you will become an unstoppable killing machine. Though there were many improvements over the first game, I still felt the first game had a better, focused story, better armor system, combat system (AP management) and pacing.  Pros  Lengthy RPG  Large variety of skills and character customization options  Dialogue is fun an intresting, a lot of world building in game  Combat is fun (though flawed). World skills like teleporting, pyramids, pickpocketing are intresting  Combat is very strategic (almost to a fault)  Very fair price for content. 100 hour playthrough doing every single quest I could. Cons  (Pro and Con I think) Teleport becomes a less useful skill in this game because of the availability of so many movement abilities to everyone.  A lot of broken achievements. Examples: pray at every altar on nameless isle, the quests associated with sebille, fane, most companions i assume  New armor system is bad. Encourages stacking either physical or magical damage. Late game it becomes irrelvant, everything is a one shot fest or everyone has an ability to completely strip your armor/magic resist  AP system is too limited compared to first game  Too many status effects and they are inconsistent. For example Rupture tendons can be used against armor, but bleeding will be blocked  Literally every battle will end covered in necrofire/fire. It makes bless a useless skill since it will ALWAYS be overwritten.  Source skills useless for first 2 areas, since you will never have enough source to use them (and wonder if they are worth saving for a truly difficult part that never comes) and overpowered for the rest of the game. Makes for a boring mechanic considering how central to the plot it is. Bless, source vampirism, and spirit vision aren't really compelling godwoken abilities honestly.  The story kind of forgets itself in the 2nd area. The game feels like a means to explore and do fun RPGeque quests, but the plot takes a backseat to it.  The final act feels unfinished. I felt like I ran into solutions to quests accidently more often than the ""correct"" way. Final battle and final choices don't feel like they were explained or fleshed out.  (EARLY SPOILER)The compnaion interaction with the game feels to forced. Everyone you meet is one of the most important people in the world. The companions who you don't pick early on, continuously show up even though you have no attachement to them at all.  Crafting, like in the first game, is exceptionally bad. You can never preview what the recipe is going to make. The receipe UI is super cluttered. Exiperimentaion is cumbersome. It's mostly luck based guessing, with a few ""skill books"". Good luck sorting through the UI with no search function or filters to get anything useful. Ignore the crafting system completely despite there being decent receipes like boots + nails, or status immunity potions. Overall a great game probably the GOTY, but I would reccomend people give the first game a chance beacuse I truly believe it is the better title between the two. A few of the characters and plot points carry over so it's worth taking into consideration before playing this game regardless. I feel like after a few patches, maybe an expansion, this game can be fixed up to be almost perfect, but for DOS is still the best example of kickstarter success and a modern CRPG with a classic taste to it."

167,[FTA]TatsuyaSuou,289,131,20,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,114.8,"While there isn't a lot that hasn't already been addressed in other positive reviews, I feel obligated to address some of the negative reviews I continually see regarding the game's difficulty.  Like any strategy-oriented game, Divinity Original Sin 2 requires quite a bit of premeditation before entering combat to guarantee success (outside of Tactician mode anyway, more on that later).    The game expects you to use the tools it gives you in each encounter though the largest issue I've seen is when you enter a new section of the game.  Before you go exploring to much it's almost mandatory to address the guaranteed difficulty creep by checking out any and all new gear/skillbooks/potions etc are available in whatever new social area you encounter.  With the game's economy being what it is, having one character geared toward thievery and another set up with a significant amount of barter goes an incredibly long way toward alleviating the need to almost constantly upgrade your gear when entering a new section of the game.  The point I'm making is that the game gives you all the tools you need to address any gear issues you might have the moment you set foot in a new town. This goes for skill books as well as there is no limit to how many books you can learn as long as you have the commensurate ranks in the associated skill and sufficient memory slots to equip them.   Anyway, the TL;DR of all that is the game gives you all the tools you need to PREPARE for difficult fights so long as you actually use them.  All that said, the AI isn't a slouch.  It can and will abuse whatever environmental things are to hand and the devs have set up a great many of the fights to favor the enemies.  This means that as a player the onus is on you to think about the party you want to put together before just trying to breeze through the game.  There are so many ways to make strong characters in D:OS 2 that they're almost limitless.  What you CAN'T do and expect to be successful is to just blindly charge into every fight and new situation with your d*** at full mast (just a turn of phrase, no offense intended ladies).  If that's the playstyle you're after there are a dozen Diablo clones or ARPGs out there that are better suited to that frame of mind.  D:OS2 has a turned-based system for a reason and is incredibly rewarding just so long as you apply some forethought to engagements. In fact, it's easily the best RPG I've played since the early 2000s in terms of gameplay.   Panning a game for being difficult is a non-starter, especially when it's only as hard as you make it by lack of planning. Unless, of course, you're playing on Tactician mode.  If you're doing that, you deserve whatever mental anguish you're suffering from because that is almost entirely designed for masochists who like to sit bare‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•on a saguaro cactus.  If that's you, by all means, buy stock in razor blades or whatever but I would seriously hope to not see any complaints about difficulty."

The depth is awesome, this is really the first game of this specific genre I have played, and I'm glad I took the risk on it. Incredibly immersing enviroments, music, story and characters. You really feel part of this world. Combat is very deep and I actually restarted the game twice before I was happy enough with my build and companions. Takes a bit of time if you are new to this series to get used to how classes and roles work, and how you should be building your team, but once you get the hang of it, it's fairly straightforward. The only negative I felt was that the journal gave a lack of direction on quests and objectives in general, but as soon as you stop treating them like quests and more like parts of a dynamic story it doesn't really matter. You can fail some, or do things wrong and that's okay it's part of your story. Often doing the wrong thing can get you some nice loot or information that helps you in some other way. Love it."

And remember, there is always the option to reload to rethink and plan. Lets hope this stays constant through the game.  Ok, the Quest Log is broken as mentioned alot. And I found a couple of bugs.  The devs are working to fix problems, but they just do not have enough people to find all the bugs. I am 100% sure the game will be fleshed out within a couple months.  I also have heard that act 3 is kind of broken in a way, which I will experience myself. So far everything is beautiful and feels good, the graphics, audio, story telling, companions and all the other stuffs. As someone who enjoys smething and goes back afterwords to see everything, this will be a great experience.    Early Access review: Before you buy: Please go play atleast some of the first game if you wanted to play this. It is finished so a new player can enjoy the full experience. I have just been reading people complain about the early access too much to ignore this.     Oh and I very strongly recommend getting a friend to join you (There is a 2 player pack I pretty sure if you are feeling generous.) Without a friend that you can enjoy playing with,the beginning will be a struggle as it is a bit misleading.     Also the game is difficult in a way that makes a person have to think critically, making a restart is inevitable unless you are either a master at these games or just have played it a while. Having another person to talk to about positioning and cc (main points of the game) really makes a restart less frusturating and more of a learning experience until you get into the groove.  If you get this game I seriously hope you enjoyed it as much as the first one. Although I haven't beaten it completely I have enjoyed every step of the teleporting mess that it is.  Also.

( i play multiple characters but right now i am about 6 hours in on my undead witch and i haven't even come close to finish act 1 and from what i've heard of others act 1 can easily become 15 hours of playtime)  -OPTIMIZATION! this game's beautifull combat effects can clutter your whole screen and your computer (or laptop) can still run it smoothly  Now some small cons:  -*total freedom on how you play. sure is nice to play it however you want but... you must also discover each mechanic yourself (this is also how Grumps started a fight because i accidentally stole a book infront of the magister and also may have hit her with a knife before) also you can miss allot of story contents if you randomly kill people.  -tutorial is a bit vague sometimes and forgettable when you get too much on your plate because at same time you are fighting and trying to predict what your enemy is going to do.  after this there aren't many cons about this game that i can mention until i have actually experienced the full game and not just act 1. call me biased but just of the sheer size of the game you should try it. i can already sense this has allot of replay value."

The combat is turn based which allows for more depth in the combat system and more strategic options.  If you haven't tried turn based combat before, this is a great way to try it.  It's like Diablo but for intelligent adults.  Each origin character provides with a completely different gameplay experience even if you play them as the same class.  Overall, as an RPG, I give DOSII a 10/10 on a curved scale.  Unparalleled in the modern PC market and preferrable to the most recent console offering Final Fantasy 15."

190,writergrimm,90,25,2,March 23,Recommended,112.9,"A rare case where the sequel is even better than the original. Put in over 100 hours on this game and loved nearly every minute of it. If you love story driven rpgs where the world you roam gives you adventure at every turn - this game is for you.   Positives: The myraid of ways you can build a character. I opted for more of a ""Warden"" route and enjoyed the freedom of veering outside of the confines of the usually locked in advancement systems found elsewhere.  The NPCs and their contribution to nearly every scene as well as their own storylines. I will admit I got a mod to allow me to take all of them along. Not so that the game would be easier but rather so I could experience all of their storylines in one playthrough. I was not disappointed. Best character development I have seen in an rpg in a long long time.  How big and developed the world is. Nearly every corner has you encountering some mystery, npc, adventure, or clue. Sometimes it can even be a little overwhelming but with time and effort - you can start mapping out everything.  The combat system. The built upon the previous one and improved its flaws. In the original, I would grenade and area effect arrow the hell out of everything. Sometimes allowed me to breeze through fights that should have required strategy. This time out - there isn't any overt easy tactics. In quite a few fights, you have to bring your strategy A game or die repeatedly.  Negatives Some of the puzzles got too clever for themselves and go well outside of the established routines of how to solve them. While in some cases this worked well, there are quite a few that gave you no starting reference point of how to even begin to solve them. This can lead to quite a bit of frustration and then gets compounded with the occasional bug that pretty much leads to a roll back save to try a different approach just to avoid the bug.   Endings. Big fan of anime here so I understand the idea of endings that aren't exactly clean but damn... the one that takes care of the most things literally nullifies the entire purpose of the game.   I NEED some Malady DLC!   In any event, highly recommend this game. One of the best I have ever played.   "
191,Heaveness,173,21,1,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,127.8,"I wanted to put at least minimum 20 hours into this game before I gave it a review. I can safely say that this is one of the best RPG games you will ever find, it's one of those games that will earn the definition of classic cRPG decades later. Normally I don't play a lot of turn-based tactical RPGs in my lifetime because I find the genre not my biggest interest but this game did a fantastic job enticing me into its universe.   Q: How does the game run? Any bugs or crashes or technical issues? A: In 30 hours of playing I have encounter maybe 1 or 2 bugs but I find them minor, for example, some quests did not classify as finished when I just got the reward for it. I have not experienced a single crash in any of my games and did not run to any framerate issues.  Q: Do you recommend it or not? A: Absolutely recommend it! The game is very well-made, the developers really poured their heart and soul into this game and it shows. It has online & local splitscreen coop, PvP, Tactical combat, controller support, mods, great writing, so much paths and methods to tackle any quest, Game Master Mode, and much more. I can tell the Larian Studios had a blast making this and it's thanks to them and the kickstarters backers that help fund this fantastic game.  Overall score: 10/10 Pros:  +Fun and challenging tactical combat  +Easy to get into but hard to master +Interesting and unique characters with the companions having their own origin stories. +Mod Support +A well-implemented coop feature that doesn't feel tacked on. +Beautiful Soundtrack +Definitely more than 100 hours of content. +Very well polished with little to no bugs or crashes and haven't experienced any framerate issues so far. +Game Master Mode which is a DnD style game which is a interesting way to play the game with friends. +Multiple ways to tackle an objective. +You have a ton of freedom and choice. +The graphics look great with some pretty locations. +So much secrets and this game encourages to carefully look and explore its world.  Neutral: =The voice acting for the most part is good but some are odd and feels inconsistent when it comes to the audio quality but it does its job. =The quest journal I find to be a clunky with the map. When you have multiple quests active, you have multiple markers on the map that just seems messy and confusing. Although it is not hard to figure out what you are suppose to be doing. =A few quality-of-life changes would have been nice like increasing the walking speed outside of combat or having the hotbar not be cluttered whenever you pick up an item like a grenade. Luckily these two problems can be fixed with a mod.  Cons: -Honestly there is zero cons I can think of for this game, other than on higher difficulties the enemies like to use a lot of cheese tactics which can be frustrating to deal with but you can use those same tactics on them too.  I'll definitely play this game much more and I have still a lot more content to explore and be playing them with my friends whenever I get the chance. I highly recommend you get this game, I gave it a 10/10 rating not as a ""This game is perfect in every way,"" the game has a few issues, but it's more of a ""This game is worth every penny of your purchase"" kind of rating. Pick this game up for yourself or with 3 other friends, you will not regret it! "

195,Ramdhanu,265,13,0,January 14,Recommended,173.9,"Divinity Original Sin 2.  While Original Sin was already a good RPG game and had plenty to offer, I was a bit skeptical that whether or  not Larian Studios could top that. But boy did they. Original Sin 2 is better than the first in every way. It‚Äôs safe to say that Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of the best, if not the best RPG of year,especially for us old school pen & paper rpg lovers.  While RPG's are all about choices & consequences & development of your character,you don't find many PC RPG's that offer this kind of choices,where your decisions and actions are so impactful. Meaning, You can kill an NPC related to the main quest,try to steal from a vendor & loose access to their inventory,build your dream character or a good for nothing crew,the choices are limitless . There is always another way to take care of your duties if you fail in one. In other worlds, Larian was able to  PUT THE R BACK IN RPG in this game.  Another really strong aspect of Divinity Original Sin 2 is its characters,especially the SIX Origin Characters to choose from who have rich backstories and amazing voice-acting to boot. Similar to Dragon Age Origins,the Origins lets you play as unique characters with their own agendas & goals. And if you want to create a custom character,then fret not,you can have them as companions in your journey. One piece of advice though. There's a nasty piece of surprise waiting for you at the end of ACT 1. So choose & build your companions carefully.  As far as gameplay is concerned, there‚Äôs nothing new or innovative in terms of gameplay, but rather, a refined version of what we‚Äôve already had for years. The only thing complicated is stuff like crafting or spell combinations and such. But once you have a general idea of how they work, you‚Äôll be breezing through them.  The game also  comes with an amazing soundtrack, very fitting for whatever situation you‚Äôre in. Additionally, the VFX sounds, be it for blood spatter or whatever fancy spell you‚Äôre flinging, and the sounds that the weird creatures and characters you come across make, it all fits right in place. Not to mention,the entire game is voice acted & makes the experience all the more enjoyable, especially for those experiencing the genre for the first time.  Similarly, no complaints with the visuals. While it‚Äôs not an extremely graphic intensive by today‚Äôs standards, but still it delivers a very visually appealing experience. The environments look great and the details in the surroundings, be it inside a ship, or a cabin, or out in the open (anywhere really), is amazing.  Overall, one will have a hard time finding another RPG like this one around. Divinity does a lot of things right and I have to hand it to Larian Studios for creating an RPG masterpiece here. The plethora of options that actually matter, the rich characters, the story itself, this game has a lot going for it. You won't & cannot go wrong with buying this game,whether on full price or on a deal.  My Verdict 9.5/10.  PS : Fund Divinity Original Sin 3 if they are going to create it in the future. What Larian has shown us so far, it is well worth to pay them the full price & something extra for their efforts."

Larian took everything that was great about the first game and made it even better.  Word of warning though, it's easier to screw up in DOS2 than it is in DOS1. Literally a minute into the game you can either recruit or kill your first companion, simply depending on how you talk to them.  Stealing mechanics changed from DOS1 -- both guards and whoever owns the item will actively seek out the thief (you), and should they find you red-handed, throw you in prison, attack or simply take the stolen merchandise, again depending on how you talk your way out of the situation. Fortunately even if you choose the violent option, the game is still perfectly playable. Merchants and civilians don't participate in the fight.  I'd write more, but I think I'll just go ahead and play some more instead."
198,Kad,9,29,0,August 30,Recommended,66.4,"Originally I wasn't going to review this game on this account because I have few hours on this account. However, reading through some of the reviews out there, I wanted to speak my piece.  This game changes things from the previous game in the series. And some argue that it makes the game harder, forcing you to play as a certain type of character. However, I feel the need to point out that you are only forced into playing a certain way if you desire to be the absolute best possible character in the game. People say that mixed damage parties are not viable because of the armor system in the game. (If you are unaware, every character in the game has an amount of Physical Armor and Magical Armor. These armors prevent damage and certain effects until they are depleted.) However, me and a friend did a playthrough of this game, and we played as a mixed damage party. For those who are interested, we had: a Summoner who also had abilities in Aerothurge, Pyrokinetic and Geomancer. That was my main. a Ranger who focused on long range physical damage, but also dabbled in Pyrokinetic. That was my secondary character. a Rogue who focused almost entirely on Physical damage. That was my friend's main. a Cleric who used Hydrosophist and Warfare, and acted as our team's tank. That was my friends secondary character. The point of that is to show that we had a diverse build to our team. Sure, it may not have been the most effective. But do you know what it was? Fun. We had a lot of fun playing that party. So, before you get this game, ask yourself this. Do I want to be able to create a character who is unique to my playstyle, even if they are not necessarily the best? If you say yes, then you will enjoy this game. There are so many options for what you can do. However, if you want to build the best possible character, then unfortunately, you will likely be disappointed with how you will need to build a certain way. However, is that not what something being the best mean? If one object is better than all other objects of the same type, does that not mean that in that catagory, there is no other choice besides that one object? It is the same for looking at the builds in Divinity: Original Sin 2. Yes, one is better than all the other. However, if you only play to have the best build, then I think you are missing the entire point of the game. This game is meant to be a medium for telling a story, for sharing memories. While you can play the game alone, it is my belief that for the true experience of the game, you should play it with friends. And when you do, feel free to play however you desire. I will lead to some good laughs when you look back at it."
199,Aisukurimu,24,12,0,May 30,Recommended,595.9,"In short, this is a game of high replayability with an immensely immersive world.    Quests Quests are in one way or another, interrelated to each other, they are not shallow ""fetch quests"" and each one actually reflects a little bit about the world of Rivellon. Players are not required to complete quests in any certain ways as each path you take is considered progression towards the ultimate goal. There are also  multiple ways to approach a single quest, whether it is to be a righteous individual and not ask for reward; to be a villain who only cares for your own self interest; or having to choose between two evils knowing either choice will have undesirable sacrifices. You could encourage a man to not dwell on pursuing vengeance and be merciful, perhaps that man will not stray from his righteous path, but he might  lose something/someone else .    Gameplay In terms of gameplay, I was initially not a fan of turn-based combat, which is largely what this game is about. I was more accustomed to ARPG-like combat as seen in Diablo 3. However, I allow myself to give this game a try despite my dislike of turn-based combat. It was a good decision as I later found myself so engaged by the turn-based combat in this game. Combat in this game has  great depth due to abilities being able to interact with the game environment, like creating chain explosions by casting fire on a poison/oil surface; or electrocuting an enemy and stunning him because you've already pre-casted a water surface beneath him. What's more amazing is that the  combat AI also make use of these mechanics! The combat has great potential for a highly strategic approach and it is very satisfying to see your strategies in effect. After multiple playthroughs, I realised that there are so many possible approaches to a single fight, and sometimes one mistake is all it takes to bring the player down from an advantageous position that could ultimately mean deaths of characters or even defeat of the whole party (The combat AI is no joke on higher difficulties, really smart and makes really calculated moves, which made the game more fun for me).    General experience In terms of the general RPG experience, personally I think the game has a  good amount of both combat and dialogues/stories. Dialogues are fully voiced and occasionally amusing. NPCs' responses in dialogue actually depend on players' races. There are also ""tags"" which can be selected when creating a custom character, these  tags allow you to do certain things that other tags cannot. For example, a character with a Scholar tag can interpret ancient tomes and gain knowledge from it; whereas a character with a Mystic tag is able to use their own sheer will to repel evil presence possessing innocent people to attack travellers. There are also ""Origin"" characters, which are essentially characters that already have their own backgrounds in the world of Rivellon and by playing as them/recruiting them as companions, you gain access to their own quests that might sometimes  intertwine with other Origin characters' quests.    Conclusion These are my personal views on what makes this game great for me. There are more exciting features that this game has which I don't think a single review can contain. If you like RPG games that leaves you an empty space after completing it, this is one such game. And the price tag is definitely modest for a game this big."

201,Nether,23,28,0,"August 7, 2017",Recommended,212.9,"Im super excited for the release date, if you're into Dragon Age or RPGs with turn-based combat, Id /strongly/ recommend it.   This is the first of the DOS games I tried, but after trying the alpha, which Ive spent 30 hours in (of the ""suggested"" 8-12 hours), I went back and played the D:OS 1, I was genuinely surprised to see it was a decent game, but also realizing that it actually is lightyears behind this one, D:OS 2.   It doesnt have the live combat, which DA has, but its turn based where the attack time is based on your characters' strengths and weakness' (for lack of better simplistic explanation) - Id personally take the real time action over this one, but it still seems to be well-made.   I think its a bit deceiving with the main character's customization, as the characters you find throughout the game can matter just as much, if not more. Only benefit is a bit of options to change the look. Additionally, I think its a shame you can swap the discovered characters in between different ""conflicting speccs"" as you find them, as in, mage OR warrior and not just pick between whether you want the warrior to be in a defensive or aggressive build - it ruins a bit of the RP feel of the characters in my mind. You could have the option to swap between the conflicting paths, but then you should get a RP story explaining why that it is a possibility, and only have it as a rare trait to some of them. If you're playing on high difficulty, having this would mean you directly need to find a healer/tank/rogue to unlock certain skills/benefits.   Im lacking a bit of character story and overall story, which you can find in the early Dragon Age games, but it hardly affects my belief of the game. Im excited to see how the late game develops, as Im afraid you get overpowered a bit too soon, in addition to the fact that the cookie cutter builds seem to be a bit too either overpowered, or obvious.   One thing I actually spite, is the fact that the amount of discovered/hidden ""legendary"" weapons are slightly too many, and of too high importance. If you're playing on max difficulty, you're almost forced to google to find them, in order to being able to beat the NPC/AI. Atleast this is the case if youre in the range of my skill-level, which admittedly isn't perfect.   Everything I could think of on the spot, September cant come soon enough."

The combat is more fluid and enjoyable, the effects are as beautiful as they go most of the time and the dialogue is quite well written. But now I can get to the biggest complaint I have: Voice acting or the lack of. At the moment the only voice acting is in the intro and combat grunting. There is no dialogue voice acting so you have to read everything. That can be a good thing, true but I myself prefer voices. The rumors have told that there would never be any voice acting but we'll see if that's true in the final game. This is early access after all.  All in all Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an amazing game right from the start and this is in alpha. We have a lot more to get and the things we have now already impress.

If you like turn-based combat, then buckle up for a robust and freeing combat and class system. You really can play the game the way you want to play it.   If you're looking for something to play with friends, this is a great game for that too. You can have a party of 4 players total, so why not bring three pals to accompany you on the perilous journey ahead.   Have no friends?

Like Gandalf after the Balrog fight, I lay like roadkill on Gaming‚Äôs Last Stand. Left in the ditch by the ravenous, greedy games industry, all but forcing me to violently amputate myself from my hobby after so many years, my thoughts returned to me through the mist of my mind. Game publishers had made me hate gaming more and more with every Microtransaction, Gambling Lootbox, and √ºbergreedy DLC-pettiness, rubbing their scummy hands together, waiting for their chance to turn me so desperate that I'd sell my mum's wheelchair just to be able to play the story of a single player game wholesale instead of in disgusting piece-meal chunks.  Exhausted. Ready to let my hobby die.  Clearing my head to drift forever into the mindless, mainstream, middle-aged hobbies of pathetic Rom-Coms so bad they have to tell you where to laugh, sports night with a team letting you down for 20 years straight, and pedantic tv-gameshow hosts as full of themselves as the CEOs and board members of todays‚Äô AAA game companies.  I had cried out for Mr. Newell, but he was nowhere to be seen. I called out for him again and again, desperately trying to summon the one time so great mythical Valve Overlord to give me a glimpse of Half-Life 3 or some other new IP, for a last incongruent attempt to restore my faith in The Greatest Hobby ever known. But Mr. Newell had sojourned to the evil gates of DOTA 2 many moons ago, and had never been seen since. Every Valve knave had followed their once and future king, but in their wake had only left silence for those few of us who still cared. Their footprints, all leading to DOTA 2, and not one leading back, had all but vanished.  And amidst the Consumer Forest behind Valve Village, there was talk of another presence, only whispered in fear, between creeping darkness and depressive thoughts; Artifact... Artifact... The wind carried the promise of a terrible omen, of yet another unnecessary card game to come, assuring the deliverance of the final strike into the once golden, now charred, heart of gaming. And Mr. Newell never appeared in this, my darkest hour. The heroic saviour was lost to time and space as he had succumbed to The Void of Game Industry Indifference.  My mind wandered. Valve Village lay in ruins. Long was the time since anyone had fixed anything on the barricades of Team Fortress, and the walls of Counter-Life: Grognard Operations' padded cells had crumbled, leaving demons and hell-outcasts running rampant and harassing any remaining villagers. There were rumors that some of the worst of these creatures had even snuck after Gabe through the gates of DOTA, in the Unholiest of Unholy joinings of good and evil, but none had heard back from them either. The Portals to the temple of Half-Life were rusted to a sad metal heap, and the temple they guarded had lied dormant for centuries with no Programmer Priests or Artist Acolytes left to work on the Half-Life religion. Valve Village was a ghost town. Dying at last, together with me.  I felt my body getting numb. I knew I was close to exhaling my last breath of gaming. Doomed to never experience the warm freedom from pathetic corporate game publisher mind tricks. Never allowed again to experience the sheer joy of a great game not tormented by CEO and board member greed.  I closed my eyes.  I made my peace with everything. Accepting of Bobby Kotick‚Äôs miniscule loaf-member, mercilessly drilling down the insides of my throat and demolishing my gag reflex for all time. No more protesting Zenimax‚Äô and Bethesda‚Äôs Pete Hines lying and lying, his nose getting longer and longer inbetween my butt cheeks as he denounced the fact that their new paid mods system is indeed paid mods. I let out a poor sigh as I came to terms with EA‚Äôs horror show, drowning me and their other customers in blank-white secrete of filthy business decisions, in amounts so vast they could shave their chiseled, unethical game publisher jawline in the mirroring reflection of my soaked forehead.  Nothing mattered anymore. We, the customers, had lost. And as a single tear ran down my cheek, gaming was dead and gone forever. I embraced the darkness and muttered a final prayer to the gaming gods of old, before feeling a last remaining speckle of life vanish from my veins. My gamer soul was ready. I was to return home to 8bit, 16bit, Playstation and PC; to the 80s and 90s gaming heaven. Far away from the grotesque demonic onslaught hell here, far from the karmic injustice of game publishers burning the industry down until they had extinguished its last pittance of grace. I was ready. And darkness came.  Then, movement.  Not from me. Outside of me.  A feather of light touched my eyes. A vague, finely tuned iota beam, shimmering onto my eyelids. It tormented my weak sight, but it was real! A light, a light! My body jolted as it shone towards me from the distant skies. My butt-crack ravaged, my throat sore, my forehead glistening with horrible, sticky Microtransaction DLC. I was not dead yet, there was a game title coming closer, flapping it's angel wings as it descended upon my old, withered gamer soul. And I could see the shape and the coming of Divinity: Original Sin 2 as the air around me became warmer and I felt life returning to me.  Larian had come to my rescue.

We played the game for many many days, completing everything we could do in the game including a lone wolf tactician mode run. It gave us many hours of enjoyment, leading to my absolute love for it. It stands as one of my top games of all time. I cant express how excited I am for this to release, I bought the early access as soon as it was available and have already spent many hours playing. The excitment to see what this great company did with this beatiful game is almost to much to contain, its needless to say ill be going on vacation for a week starting today!"

It will be very difficult to replay some of my old-school games having played this now, as I'm ready to replay it again.

Plus the fact the tone is both dark and clever with many humorous moments yet not very goofy and cartoony like the first one is a real winner in my book.   There are a few bugs here and there, but other than that, I feel it deserves the GoTY Award.   Update: PC Gamer 2017 Game of the Year Award I guess I have good taste...or PC Gamer does.

216,Shraska,116,81,8,"November 7, 2016",Recommended,125.1,"[I played through the early access at November 7th]  THE GOOD!+ New races to play  + No ""pawns"", so full 4-player Co-op available  + Alot of improvements from the first game  + Overall graphical upgrades  + New special ability system   THE BAD!- You always feel Overpowered   - Stats need rebalancing. Going full initiative makes sure you always get to play first. You can kill all enemies before they have a first turn (on highest difficulty!)  - Obvious huge gaps in item upgrades  - Pickpocketing still way too broken (unlimited gold/all shopitems for free)  - Having 1% magic armor is enough to stop all debuffs  - Enemies too easy to crowd control (stun / freeze / knock down spam)  - Rangers STILL do too much damage (very broken in first game)  - No penalty for poor intelligence / low magic skill. Your spells will always land and you will always have 100% chance to crowd control. You can have a warrior/rogue/ranger hybrid mage. Having a pure mage is such a waste.  - Whole game revolves around the ""teleport"" spell or simular transportation abilities  - TOO many abilities that allow you to escape or move enemies. You can never get hit by melee enemies, and you can always teleport enemy ranger/mage infront of your melee team and just insta-kill them on highest difficulty.  - Almost all of the quests are broken. If you don't do them in the correct order (which means you can't explore anything) you can never complete them. Even the final quest of Act 1  - When you start a fight, your characters run around and position them selves very awkwardly. Even if you pre-set them in high ground etc they will run down and just stand somewhere totally unconvenient  - Sometimes the conversations always end in the same way, no matter what you choose to say. For example; you argue with an NPC. The outcome is exactly the same no matter if you win or lose the argument  - Argument stats (intimidate, wits, intelligence etc) don't matter. If you have maxed out your strenght you will still lose intimidation checks vs. cowards, if that's what the game-designers intended.  CONCLUSION! ‚Ä¢ All non-direct damage spells need to be nerfed alot.   ‚Ä¢ Debuff vs. magic armor system needs to be reworked.  ‚Ä¢ Conversations need to matter (it's an RPG for crying out loud..)  ‚Ä¢ Exploring shouldn't be punished by breaking quests.  ‚Ä¢ Crafting is totally pointless and needs to be reworked.  ‚Ä¢ Pickpockets needs a huge nerf.. since the starting area I have had the best items available to me.    There are alot of things that need improving and changing, obviously it being in EARLY ACCESS. I still recommend the game because I really enjoyed the first one and I know/hope they won't polish this one any less.  Hoping they put alot of effort into balancing things out so I don't feel like a God at level 2 (on highest difficulty);   I will probably rate the game 8/10 when complete (and nerfed)."

218,Aporis,124,96,16,"October 11, 2017",Recommended,88.0,"TL;DR. A damn crab on the beach is more deeper character than any NPC in Skyrim or Fallout 4 ever. Gameplay is so much more enjoyable and deeper than for example the Witcher series. Characters are relatable and funny like in Mass Effect games! Makes me so salty to think about it that they stuffed all this to one single indie title...  PROS: After finishing my 14 hour tutorial (EDIT: NVM I'm STILL IN THE TUTORIAL) I can already say this game does everything right and I ducking love it! This is the game that made me belive in the game industry again. I didn't like turn based combat, until now. I didn't like isometric point of view, until now. I didn't care too much about ingame conversations, until now. An RPG game you can play with FRIENDS and even cause drama in the scale of Mario Kart! Dialogue is far from monotonic and doesn't take itself too seriously. Voice acting is excellent to the point I found myself stopping to listen to the dialogue even tho I had finished reading it a while ago. I haven't had this rewarding and brain stimulating singleplayer experience for as long as I can remember. I haven't enjoyed this deep, different and open ways of approach to different situations ever in a videogame before.  If you're being like me and see all the reviews and think ""Should I buy this? What if I don't like it? It's so expensive"" JUST BUY IT IN THE NAME OF SOURCE! You won't regret it meow.  CONS: -Can't play accordion. -Steals your life."

220,GaloreDruid,54,10,1,April 5,Recommended,223.9,"I have not finished this game yet, currently I am approaching the end of act 2. That certainly goes to show something about the amount of content in this game, considering how many hours I've already played this game for. So far, I have a good grasp on what this game is like, so I'll give you a list of the good and bad.  Pros: Lots of content You have the option to do what quests you want to Quests have multiple ways of doing them Insane freedom is given in this game which I think RPGs tend to be lacking in (for story choices) Difficult fights that give a sense of achievement Variety of fights (no 2 fights are the same) The story Dialogue is all voice acted. Voice lines sound like there was a lot of thought put into each one. Dialogue for animals when you have pet pal This game achieves having a serious tone while having humor at the same time Descriptions for items are hilarious (ex. dismembered foot, ""All five toes, check! An attacked leg, Uhhhh..."" or when you click on a globe the narrator says, ""And you thought Rivellon was flat"") Insignificant NPCs still have voice lines, which really improves the immersion into the game You can steal whatever you want and kill whoever you want, however, there is an attitude system that punishes you for that Origin Characters in the game have interesting back stories The game allows you to have a romance with all the origin characters, including a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing skeleton, no more needs to be said. There are no traditional classes you are stuck to. You can mix and match whatever spells you want. For example, you could try going double shields with no weapon, and the spell ""shield throw."" I don't know why you would want to do it, but its possible The game is begging to be replayed with all the different builds on characters, origin character stories, and the ridiculous amount of choices you can make. The game has a tag system where your character earns tags through their actions, which gives you more dialogue options, and determines how npcs react to you. Elemental surfaces in combat are a very fun mechanic to work with. Races you pick in this game (Dwarf, Elf, Lizard, Human, and all the undead versions) all have unique abilities and tags unique to the races.  Cons: You can be thrown into a fight you don't expect (which can be also a pro depending on how you see it) Sometimes areas are high level to discourage you from going into them yet. This can get confusing when you don't know that there is another area with lower level enemies. You will use google at some point during this game. Some puzzles/ quests can be very difficult to figure out how to complete. Quicksave often, sometimes you might accidentally steal an item you didn't mean to if you click the wrong thing when moving. Devs, please just remove taunt entirely or change it. It's only one fight in the entire game so far that I've had to deal with this, but watching my character taken over by ai for a turn or two and using every scroll and source ability in my inventory is not an enjoyable game mechanic. Especially since it now pierces armor.  Overall, this is a great game that I would encourage you to give a try. It has some negatives, but they are definitely worth dealing with for the insane amount of positives the game has. The game has really good devs who seem to want to deliver a quality product, which they have. Out of all the RPGs I've tried, this is the best in my opinion."

A con though is that the difficulties isnt mere: More/Less HP or dmg, but the enemies changing their whole attack pattern. F.e. In tactician(hard) mode we hade a fight where they bursted our group in the first round with tons of elemental combos, when in Classic(normal) mode the same enemy encounter on the same level didnt use any element even once in the whole fight.  Feeling whise its going from 'Naked in a Snowstorm' to 'Idle on a Caribbean Beach'. Thats only from Hard to Normal, cant imagine the Very Hard mode.  I assume that even on Classic mode it gets a bit harder as the game continues, concidering my review takes place in the starting area.

225,Marius,161,10,0,August 3,Recommended,270.2,"This game was amazing. The complex combat kept pulling me back to it. The story was immersive. I am writing this review to warn you about the end. The game is amazing until you get to the end. The game all of a sudden wants to throw weird puzzle mechanics that just don't fit with the flow of the game. They are also really annoying. Some boss fights don't follow the combat mechanics but yet your party does. The bosses do like 10 things at once and get back all of their AP (action points) on their next turn. If you played it on lone wolf, then you are able to do it too, but reccommended for advance players. My last warning before you buy this beautiful game is that the game still has bugs in it. There are many quest that can glitch out resulting in you not getting the xp or the award for completing the quest. There is a large list of them and you can google them when the time comes. I only had the one quest bug on me when i played through the game. Others had at least 10 + quest bug out for them. Worth it to the very end."
226,Kaaros Aleri,331,13,4,"March 29, 2017",Recommended,189.3,"Short Version: The game is fudgin awsome, and in my opinion lives up to the Original Sin (hehe), Dialogue is better, Combat is slightly different but still just as fun, though the attributes still needs work and ballancing, the drop in multiplayer sucks massive Cysealean Fish gonads because of the almost non-existant host controls and no in-game voice chat that i could find, though in organized play can probably be the most awesome experience in the game because of the awesome saves that can happen with you and your friends. I rate the game a 9/10 with the multiplayer a 5/10.  This review will be mainly on singleplayer gameplay, of which i have player over 24 hours during the writing of this review and i will try not to spoil or touch the main story, quests and puzzles.           Gameplay 8.7/10                     The gameplay, much like it's predescessor, is a turn based RPG a la classic fallout and in my experience is much faster paced than fallout and Divinity: Original sin. The difference in gameplay from Divinity: Original sin is that the action system is more compact, some attributes were replaced to make things more simpler, defence from physical and magical attacks as secondary ""health"" bars instead of %reduced, a character past system that gives you new dialogue, and that the dreaded rock paper scissor persuasion system is gone. Many sees the changes as a double edges sword as it removes the more familiar aspects of the game, but to me it was very easy to learn which may have been the intent of the studio and you can take this as a negative or a positive.      Dialogue and persuasion system   10/10   Better than previous system in my opinion  The player dialogue changes i very much appreciated, especially the removed rock paper scissor system, the character past dialogue is interesting and suprisingly incredibly useful as you can get minor help from NPCs, an example would be ""MINOR SPOILER""  in the cave there is a lizard who sells physical weapons, armor, and spellbooks that will give you a minor discount for having the soldier tag  .      Combat Gameplay   9/10   It's different though not much better than the previous system in my opinion.  The gameplay and combat is still quite similar to it's predescessor, but much more fast paced and flashy, especially the new source magic though some of it can be underwhelming. Many of the combat changes seems to be based around the new magic and physical armor system, particularly the damage dealt within one round of combat seems to have been bumped up by a lot both NPC and playable characters compared to the older system.  The difficulty around the armor system can sometimes be glaring because magic, to me, is a much greater threat than physical attacks because of the almost ridiculous amounts of dangerous magical effects that enemies utilize like  poison, stun, fire, frozen, and curse  compared to the physical debilitations,  cripple, knockdown and in rare cases bleed  being the most dangerous physical ones. The good thing about the new system is that as long as you have the type of armor the effect/element affects the debilitation will only be applied when that armor bar is fully depleted, though some can see this as a negative since i actually liked the willpower/bodybuilding system.  Physical combat is still a very good way to do focused damage on one particular enemy, but is more devastating on one with little to no physical armor as  a well placed  barrage of arrows and melee hits can dispatch those enemies very quickly, though the same can't be said for monsters fighting against the playable characters unless the players are underleveled, but a proper and well built team can still kill enemies 3 levels higher than them.      Attribute changes   7/10   Simplifying things doesn't mean better, this is a good example. Worse than the previous system but is still okay in my opinion. The attribute changes to me are weird, like dr seuss weird, wits being too good with it affecting initiative and perception, constitution does not affect anything other than health, memory not affecting anything other than amount of spells (in my opinion it should affect some dialogue or something out of combat), and intelligence, having the same problem with memory only affecting combat and spells with no change in dialogue or out of combat stuff, strength is still heavily affecting combat very useful for throwing and lifting stuff and other out of combat stuff but is still overtaken by telekenessis, finesse only seems to affect combat and theivery, all in all the attribute changes are pretty wonky compared to the previous game.     Multiplayer   Drop in 3.1/10  oh boy.    Organized 10/10  I've not played organized multiplayer but i can see it being incredibly fun. I've only played multiplayer once and it was drop in multiplayer, and first impressions are the most important especially for new players. There are very little controls for the host of the game, for a game based heavily based on teamwork and tactics there is no voice chat from what i can find, the kick function does not work properly because a player can just rejoin particularly trolls and greifers. A help bar and proper command console/tab for hosts can help tremendously, adding a function that ban players from the server, and an option for local voice chat can help drop in play by a lot.  "

228,Brian (The Schmaltzy Cynic),888,16,10,"October 19, 2017",Recommended,179.3,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is the making of legends in modern games: A fully-voiced acted, superbly written 40-50 hour journey, tailored for both single-player or four-player local/online cooperation, with as much reasons for replayability to shape the narrative and to bite further into its sense of challenge as the amount of genuine affection and RPG craftmanship made into this one game. When you feature dynamic instrument options for battle music in a character creator and even after a hundred hours you still have more to learn and to explore in the world, you know you have stumbled across a game unlike no other.   This is also ignoring the extra features made for the community to expand the life of DOS2 with a Pen & Paper style mode, Game Master, and a dev-kit of modding tools to create your own adventures that harkens back to the glory days of Neverwinter Nights. There is simply too much care crafted into the soul of this game that it is simply impossible not to fall in love with it, even if the gameplay can pull some cheap punches for challenge leftover from the previous title. At its worst, DOS2 can be so mired by its hurdles that it makes the pursuit even more tempting to overcome. Unlike the original, this diamond in the rough illuminates all traces of imperfection the more you become lost in its brilliance.  It‚Äôs Not What You Say That Counts; It‚Äôs What You Do Before I begin to address the issues, the writing techniques of DOS2 need to be given their praise. Unlike the original which made itself into a buddy comedy experience to a fault for its abundance of comedy and non-cooperative dialogue, DOS2 keeps some of the buddy chatter for only multiplayer and the game focuses more on second-person dialogue to create the amount of choices and role-playing opportunities. Instead of creating lines for every character in every scenario, the dialogue creates the illusion of what you want to say and how you say it by smartly giving you options written as commands.   If you are not sure what I mean, then think of the situation this way: The writers can write as much options as they need to convey all available options without having to take into consideration of the character‚Äôs tone. Instead of writing out a angered, elated, depressed, etc. response, the narrator only has to give you options like a choose-your-own adventure book. (Ex. *Assume you know what he is blabbering on about.*) This method adds far more role-playing options without breaking immersion of your character, and it adds far more vivid choices that can affect the moment.  Even if you prefer a character with all voice-acted lines, DOS2 also offers Origin characters which are the companions of the game that you can play with their own backstories and voice-actors. You still can make choices but the character is more grounded than custom ones, and unlike the original the companions or players you tag along with have a greater sense of companionship because of this dialogue system and the story being focused on deciding whether to stick together or to divide amongst yourselves. This is a beautiful system that caters to all preferences in RPGs that does not weaken the storytelling nor the role-playing of the game, and it‚Äôs a system I hope more RPGs include this method to save money on voice-acting every single line.     Call Me Unreliable‚Ä¶ Well, I‚Äôm None Too Clever; I Just Adore You Now let‚Äôs discuss the biggest issue with DOS2 that stems from the original, the seemingly unpredictable difficulty until you learn the game from the inside out. After nearing 200 hours, starting from Explorer and reaching the modded Infernal Difficulty, my experience has become a well-rounded experience, and this statement is still true. This is why I think it‚Äôs important to revisit this section to delve into the discussion once more.  Compared to the first game, DOS2 has a more creative approach to difficulty than rigid standards of what it defines as challenge. It is by no means an easier game than the first as Fort Joy is the first major obstacle to overcome due to resource scarcity and the importance of synergy with your builds; however, there are modifiers to enhance the challenge to suit the player. These things include making undead characters who can only heal by poison, which isn‚Äôt as much of a problem as it sounds as you can make interesting undead teams, straying from traditional party set-ups like having no main healer, or by adding more/less characters to the experience. (The ironic twist is that a two-man Lone Wolf party is MORE capable than a seven-man team on the same difficulty.) All of these modifiers are creative means for players to create a game as difficult as they want and still retain its sense of balance.  This balance is largely the result of all the new changes to combat. For starters, the armor system is completely reworked into physical and magic armor, which helps divide enemies by targeting their weaker armor. This also prevents stun-lock skills like battering ram to be abused without removing all the physical armor. As a result, it‚Äôs more important to make every party member have decent equipment and weapons‚Äîwhich in a strange way makes adding more companions more difficult with less good armor to go around‚Äîas enemies often will use area-of-effect attacks to weaken your party.   Second, the environment has more usefulness in combat. One simple change is the addition of elevation scaling that can add/lower damage based on who has the higher ground. Archers gain stupidly insane damage scaling as a result of this feature which makes them the most worthwhile member on the team. Elemental effects remain as potent, but the magic armor helps negate their damage spiraling out of control. UI problems like line of sight are no longer an issue as hitboxes have proper sizes as I never made one mistake in my decisions. However, certain elements like curse are often annoying because if you cast Bless on a pit of fire to remove them it should heal your party, but it will damage them instead; you have to cast it again, a limited resource, to make it heal them.  As a result of these features, the inventiveness and fluidity of combat never becomes stale, which only rewards players more incentive to play around with its systems and its immersive storytelling features that the Infinity Engine games always aspired to be. Whenever I think I have discovered everything, even 150 hours into the game, I manage to discover something new. This beauty itself is forever stuck in my mind after deciding to restart the game again because I wondered if two undead can romance‚Äîif a game can tantalize you back with a simple, ‚ÄúWhat if‚Ä¶?,"" then this game is truly something special.   An Ocean of Content with 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea Aside from those issues, the game is phenomenal any way you look at it as an RPG. The role-playing itself sets new boundaries and standards for all RPGs, single-player or cooperative. The sense of freedom and cooperation is leagues better than it was previously. Even the story itself handles its comedic elements far better with its grit that the darker moments are never too far away from a chuckle to lighten the mood. Lastly, modders will be able to take all the lessons learned from its community and Larian Studios themselves to create a thriving landscape of future potential for this game and the future of Divinity.  Whether or not you are familiar with the Divinity series, DOS2 is great on its own merits. However, a lot of meaning will be lost if you do not know the series‚Äô history as it takes place 1,000 years after the original (four years after Beyond Divinity.) This is not a criticism but something praiseworthy that describes DOS2 as a whole; it‚Äôs a game with 20,000 leagues of depth beneath the sea and an ocean of content that spans across the horizon. This is a journey that will make you crave more adventure."

That part of the campaign also happens to have good replayability, because every quest can be finished in a diverse number of ways. The gameplay, while lacking some polish and balance (not too long ago some skills were seriously overpowered), is impressive and looks like it's only going to get better.

I hate all the animals in this game I start the game on a ship at sea, after a couple of pop-ups to get started I notice a sheep in a pin. Sheep are adorable so of course I want to pet the sheep, right? I tell her she's so cute and fluffy I wish I could pet her forever and I ask if can have a tiny piece of her wool. ""What?! A piece of my wool? It's bad enough I'm stuck on this boat, now you want to cut a b%$#h?!""   I can take a hint, so I keep walking and see a dog. Doggo! Doggo's are always cool so this must be where the game tells you that you can have a pet, I can't wait to get... ""I will bite you directly in your @$$."" Uh, don't you mean 'on' my... ""I said WTF I meant!!!"" I'm starting to think I should not have taken the ability to speak to animals.  Before any other animals can make me feel like crap, the ship is attacked. I run outside and there are MASSIVE Kraken tentacles wrapped around the hull trying to snap the ship in half. I do not know what the Kraken was so angry about, I didn't ask because I watch anime and I know a set-up when I see one.   Most of the crew gets washed up on the shore of a penal colony. I sit on the beach and think about how lucky I am, poking the sand with a stick, and a little crab scuttles by. Hello little crab. ""How DARE you address me, puny miserable flesh-stick! I am the most powerful sorcerer IN THE WORLD, I will banish you to the depths of the void with the click of my claw! Your soul will burn in endless agony! You will rue the day you crossed...."" She's gonna be a while so I decided to leave, but this rat who saw what happened is like ""Wow you just got owned! You look like you still scared, you scared little chicken, bwaak bwaak little chicky chicky!""   $%#t-talked by a rat, because FML I guess.  I try to learn to fit in, get on with life, but I got in trouble and was thrown into prison which is odd since this is already a penal colony, so I guess this is technically super-jail? Anyway, I do find an escape tunnel but it's inhabited by giant fire-slugs. I try to sneak passed, but one of them catches me and demands to know what I'm doing. I'm trying to get the hell out of here. She says that's perfect and informs me that she is in fact royalty and in need of a messenger. ""You will carry my Royal Decree to all the lands far and wide, Her Royal Majesty is now accepting inquiries and courtships from suitable bachelors of notable lineage!"" Ok, so basically you'll let me pass on the condition that I tell people you're single and searching? ""Correct! I expect only the finest and most wealthy Courtiers!"" But, you're a giant snot-bug.

Personally to me feels very handcrafted instead of how alot of newer games tend to feel cut and pasted. PROS +game design- if you think through all situations and are willing to die a few times trying there are many different ways to complete any situation. +graphics- my pc is not grand(base alianware alpha I3 until i pay my house down and build my new pc this winter) and i run this game at 1440p high graphics and around 30 fps( never dipping below) +choice-i truely feel like i have a say at some parts of this game( hence i said someparts, this is very clsoe to a pen and paper but does fall short as will all games every played with any type of AI, it is just in the nature.) +difficulty- i know this has been a hot subject since alot of people are finding the game a little to difficult but it is my own opinion, i play on tactition mode, have 1.) undead poly, ranger. 2.)normal summoner lohse. 3.) normal rouge sibille. 4.) normal geo, warfare beast.  and i find the enocunters to be very difficult but i really enjoy a true challenge, as well as a challenge to know when i am out matched( does not happen often for most games now a days with all the monsters leveling with you. eg The Elder Scrolls Online, )i do enjoy that game too.)) +balance- while this is not a perfect positive i felt it worth noting. no game can be perfectly balenced but i feel as though my build setup(see note above) is far from perfect and yet i play on the hardest normal difficulty. and to me that is saying something, i did not feel like i had to play a certain way to enjoy the harder fights.  now for some of the bad i did notice.  -the number one thing i saw in this game that was missing... it is most likely something small to most but enemys and other npcs have things on their body that is not in their inventory. now i dont mind not having the armour and weapons, i would feel like i would be overwelmed with over powered things that would make me feel to powerfull( i dont enjoy that it gets boring, i like the fight just to stay in the fight.) but if i could use my rouge to sneak and replace a healing potion with a poison bottle, that would change the game for me. allow me to steal things( if i was tacticle about manuvering the land not to get caught.) that might hinder my teammates useless for fights. i just feel like that would be the cherry atop the already iced and sprinkled cake. -difficulty- i personally understand why alot of people dont like the way the game was made more (difficult) with it only being a stat buff to the enemys, and a rather drastic one at that, so i think there could be more difficulty modes, and take the one good thing from ark Survival evolved and add a slider for a custom difficulty( this is supposed to mimic a pen and paper like dnd give the players the choice.   there are more pros and cons to this game, but these were the ones i felt i would want to know about if i were trying to decide on buying this or not.  for me this game is a solid 10/10 there is room for improvment in any game but give credit where it is do. this game deserves it, it is rather a amazing title.  P.S. this is one of the maybe 4-7 games i have bought non-steamsale. i do not regret it at all and would very much recomend it to single player or multiplayer. thank you for reading this far and i hope this review helped you make a decision.( ask any questions you guys may have and i will do my best to answer!)  EDIT*  one more thing that I thought of that I personally feel should be fixed, as far as combat goes I don't mind the stat buff or the enemy having shorter cool down for skills then you do.  with that said the game should not allow an enemy to have free range of sight, what I mean is I have seen so many times that if I am in range but not within line of sight a enemy can hit you but not vice versa.  to me this is far from a game breaking bug. but it is the only way I feel gimped in any true way cause I cant truly have all power over placing my troops since ( in some cases) enemys could fire through that brush that I hid behind while shooting the other guy, with that said it also does not happen that often."

Why? I get it. You saw some screenshots, watched some videos and probably you don't like some elements of the game. It's nothing like what you've played before, and you thought well it's not your type, doesn't suit your taste. I know, people are way too individualized. But, what defines your taste? Youtubers? Streamers? Friends? Game Studios? No. It's yours. A true gamer never stops exploring. Every once in a while you need to step out of your comfort zone and try something different. Yes, from what you've learned about this game, your prejudices are probably 100% accurate, but if you haven't tried it, please don't believe you won't like it.   If you've had the patience to read thus far, stir up a bit of courage and buy this game. Just sit back, empty your mind, and DOS2 will expand it, then blow it up into pieces.   If for some stupid reason you are still reluctant to try this game, it would be such a painful loss, a shame and a pity for both me and you.

I just wanted to give some feedback on the things I personally think are too overpowered. So I played as a elf warrior, and your race ability as elf is that you get 1 AP and + 25% dmg for some constitution. Then as a warrior you have enrage, which gives you 100% crit, and you can choose a talent called ""War Lord"" which enables you to get 2 AP back when you execute an enemy. With Warrior having 3 charges (Blitz Attack, Battering Ram and Phoenix Dive) which only cost 1 AP and Crippling Blow and Whirlwind as AoE you can easily solo pretty much everything. Those things in combination with the golden double handed axe you can buy from an NPC not that far into Fort Joy's story line you are just way too powerful compared to everything else. I mean pretty much all I did with Lohse and Sebille was relocating enemies using Teleportation and then just utterly demolishing everyone with my warrior. Red Prince was basically only there for the extra cc, allthough I found out that stacking physical armour on him and giving him Bracus' Helm and letting him learn Overpower is incredibly powerful aswell, seeing that he can shatter enemies' physical armour in an instance, making them an easy target for chain ccing them. So that was the part about warrior being too powerful, now I wanted to move to the part where I REALLY like the idea of two different types of armour (physical and magical) and them protecting you from negative status effects, BUT on the other hand it's just way too easy to abuse this mechanic into chain ccing everything, making the fights not really challenging at all. So in the end I wanted to say: Don't get me wrong, I really REALLY like the game and I was soooo frustrated when I cleared the first act that I had to wait until the actual release of the game, but I personally found those things that I listed too powerfull."

I can only hope that Larian continues to flesh out this already rich experience and expand it. There's so much here, and so much potential. Improving upon everything I can think of from the first game, they've really done the RPG genre some justice.

I've been burned by alot of Early Access titles before but I'm really happy to say Divinty: Original Sin 2 blew me away.  In terms of gameplay the combat was just the right amount of difficult (classic difficulty) so that I had to really think about my actions and not just go on auto pilot and auto attack, but not too difficult that I had to read guides on how to beat a certain boss or encounter. The puzzles and quests were engaging enough that I didn't blow through them and forget about them, but not too complex or long that I was completing them simply for the sake of moving on.  There were a few bugs such as certain skills failing to registering but seeing as this is an Early Access game I'm not too worried (In 19 hours of gameplay skills only failed to land 3 times).   If you enjoy RPGs you'll love this game. I'm not a big fan of turnbased games, I simply get bored because I feel no connection to the characters in top down turnbased games, but, like Xcom: EW and XCom2, DoS2 seemed to make all my concerns about turn based games fade. I truly felt invested in the characters and felt like I was in the middle of the action, cheering when my glass cannon rogue pulls off an insanely reckless but satisfying attack. The game truly elicited some genuine reactions from me. I got upset when my mage stupidly pulled aggro and laughed when a massively armored knight failed to land a killing blow on me because he slipped on some blood. It engaged me better than some AAA First person RPGs did.    The story was well written for the first act, and leaves you hungry for more. The NPCs are enjoyable to interact with and the relationships they have with the PC and his party actually make sense.‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•a trader off enough he/she will stop trading. Steal from someone, you have to return the goods and get back in his good will before talking to him again.   The graphics are nice and the UI and controls aren't annoying. The AI is smart and for the most part doesn't get in your way. You just have to watch out for the sight lines of hostiles. The AI party members tend to stick very closely to the PC but if you're trying to squeeze past a narrow space they may accidentally walk into hostile sight lines triggering a fight. That's a very nity-picky problem that can easily be solved by watching out for your party better.  The freedom that this game gives you in actions and choices really is unparalleled.  I reccommend getting it now and enjoying it, but even if you wait I believe every RPG fan who wants to really feel immersion should get this game. Get it now, or get it later it doesn't matter so long as you get the game. You won't regret it."

Larian did imrpove on Divivinity OS 1 and made this game much better. In retrospect D:OS 1 (even though i liked it) looks like a prototype/proof of concept in comparsion to this iteration.  The Good:  -Combat system is great. Especially the adition of Physical and Magical Armor. -Likeable Companions with their own story. -Better Graphics, Effects and animations (compared to D:OS1) -Overall better Combat system (but some small annoyances) -Loads Of content (Took me about 100 hours to finish the game) -Great Soundtrack -Improvements on unique playstyles (Playing undead etc)  The Bad: -The story. Even though betetr than the story of D:OS and even though it is passable it wasn't that interesting to me. Occasionally the side story fo the companion characters were much more interesting to me. -There are still bugs(e.g. Even though i choos e a different ending i got another one->won't go into detail so i won't spoil a thing) -Small annoyances in combat: Source Point system wasn't going really anywhere for me. Should have been refined.; Some enemies have annoying abilities: Cursed Wardens/Necrofire........ -At the last chapter some of the quests are knda tedious. Sometimes more is less.   Anyhow, all in all one of my most favourite RPGs of all time I think.  Let's hope Divinity 3 will be even better.  p.s.:If you liked the D:OS series you could always go back and try Divine Divinity (Diablo like 2d game) or Divinity 2 Director's Cut(Gothic/Risen kinda game with skills and dragon transformation.)

Going from soundtrack, to gameplay, and the story.  Soundtrack : The music in the game is really good, the orchestral OST really makes the game, many locations and fight have fitting music for what they are. It's good to listen to the game OST even outside the game or use it in Roleplay sessions, I cannot add anything more to be honest... The soundtrack is truly great.  Gameplay : The gameplay is really good, I love turn-based combat in games and it is very refined combat from the first game. You can use envinronment in your advantage, set up poison and during the combat light it on fire, set up barrles of oil and poison ready to be destroyed and many more things which I really love about the combat. The gameplay itself is very nice, camera movement is nice and you can move it around however you want, the dialogue menu is pretty good. My only gripe was inventory but it's because it was mess thanks to my own fault (but auto sort button is pretty nice)  Story : It's good, great, awesome. The dialogues are very well written, the NPCs are ""alive"", it feels like they are real people, the talking with animals and them giving you quests is great addition to the game. Companions are also well written making it like you are adventuring actually with real people, with their own problems, agendas, interrupting talks sometimes to add something of their own. The game had as well really interesting plot twists in some places.

First turn-based RPG I've played and each fight was really interesting, a bit like chess because you had to carefully use your turns or the game would kick your sweet patootie.  The biggest weakness for me was the game didn't seem to keep up with the changing context eg you may have completed a mission in a particular way and characters in the game would still be talking to you about it as if you hadn't done it yet.  This is probably because the game provides so much freedom that the devs couldn't possibly predict what every player might choose in every instance.  The final fight was a bit of a fizzer - I befriended the main villains so that they helped me fight the prime villain - so that ended him relatively quickly and then it was pretty much over - I didn't even have to kill the rest of them.

Pros:  - Story: Amazing Introduction that ramps up to a very good confusing mid game meltdown and ends in emotional chaos. - Gameplay: Top Notch, skills, spells, interactions, AI, everything feels smooth and fights never get boring. - Length: You dont know when the game is finally over it is soooo long and thats a good thing - Difficulty: On Tactician the game starts absolutely brutal, towards the end it unfortunately becomes easier except a few exceptions who are crazy hard again.   Cons:  - Merchants: 1 Hour waiting to get a chance of new piece of gear, no gear leveling with you, lots of unique armors or weapons capped at level 18. You can fix this though by using mods but then you get no achievements. It's not noticeable until the very end but then you notice it very hardly, to the point you go afk for 1 hour to get some new gear.  - Skills: Some skills felt lacking, especially the source skills resolve into 2-3 being better then all the others which makes you feel pidgeon holed since the enemies on harder diffs are going to spam you with the good stuff. Some skills npc's use cant be learned... also you cant make true new classes in the SDK currently which is a big downer  - Story: I understand that with so many choices it gets more complex to keep track of everything, sometimes the game does not explain or give you a chance on understanding why a character in the story would do something. One example would be Gareth if you chose to destroy everyone but side with him always, he still will be opposing you at the end while not explaining why so yeah thats unfortunately not the only story let downs.  - Thievery: only 1 pickpocket per NPC per character this is ridiculous by the astronomical prices you have to pay and the minimal gold you get for selling stuff.

254,Enzevil,393,14,2,June 23,Recommended,117.5,"It was about time I write a review about Divinity: Original Sin 2. Let me start off with this: it's one of the best RPGs I've ever played, and this game ended up in my personal top 10 favorite games of all time. So if you're curious about why it's so good, read on!  Divinity: Original Sin 2 starts off with the choice to create your own character, or to pick one of the Origin characters. Origin characters are full fledged characters with a personal background, but you can still choose how you want to play them. These Origin characters can be your party members throughout the game, so I found it more insteresting to have my main character be self made.  The game really has a tabletop RPG (like Dungeons & Dragons) feel to it. You can really choose how you want to play. In most games, if you want to be a Jack of all Trades, you're a master of none. In this game, you're a master of all. Because the more skills you combine, the better results you get. For example, if you choose to be a Sorcerer, you can combine water with lightning or with ice. If you first use a water spell, the ice or lightning spell will have a greater effect on the enemy. You will be well rewarded for creativity.  It also has a tactical turn-based combat system. Even movement and placement is key in combat, as well as your (combination of) skills of course. It can take a little while to get used to, but damn, the combat is awesome. It's not like other normal turn-based game, where you obviously have a best skill to use every turn. It really requires tactical thinking, and it feels really rewarding if your plan worked in combat.  The roleplaying aspect is wonderful. Not everything has to be solved my combat. There are always multiple ways to solve things, even in side quests. Not only does your background matter, but also your race. Every background and race have multiple and different roleplaying options, even for the Origin characters, who also have unique dialouge options. Oh, and yes, there are romance options in the game as well.  The goal is to become a God, literally, but the biggest accomplishment is the journey. Yes, this sounds cliche, but you will really feel this after completing this game. Are you satisfied with the choices you made, to become a God? Maybe you can't even become a God, because of the choices you made. After completing this game, it really made me think twice about the choices I made in my journey and it's really magnificent if a game can do that for me.  I'm really grateful for completing this game. It was a wonderful experience and it has so much to offer, even compared to other modern RPGs nowadays. I really recommend this game if you like RPGs or games with tactical combat. Also worth noting: Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition will launch in August and is free for all owners of this game. So even if you're waiting for the that, get this one now and you'll receive the Definitive Edition later, for free!"

256,Jayco√ü,262,11,0,"September 8, 2017",Recommended,406.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2  is everything the first game was but better and more. There's more options character wise (many different races), more possible outcomes of events and your decisions, more spellls, more everything!      The story is quite interesting, because this time around it seems to be more serious, dark and characters you meet (especially your companions) have their own unique storylines and motives which make you want to learn more about them, understand their POVs and interact with them (very reminiscent of the legendary Baldur's Gate games). After beating Act 1 I'm absolutely hooked and cannot help but wonder how their stories might unfold and what suprises await along the way.  UPDATE: The full game has come out and just as I expected it's bloody brilliant. Made it past the zone from early acces and there's so much to do, so much content that it's overwhelming. Best RPG ever!!!     The combat is more satisfying and rewarding than ever. It encourages creative thinking and approach to your encounters, as well as using the environment to your advantage. There's new spells and spell schools, including summoning and polymorph as well as many additions and positive changes to the old ones. The turn based battles feel a lot more fluid and engaging thanks to many mobility options characters got (grow wings and fly away, charge at your enemies or jump back - there's always an option). And of course You have the option to play the campaign with a buddy or a random person online. There's also a game master, dnd like mode coming which looks very promising. Exploration and experimenting with crafting and such is very rewarding and satisfying.    The audio is stunning, with a remarkable main theme chorus music that I cannot help but to hum to myself as  I wait for full release! Game let's you pick a favorite out of 4 instuments (oud, tamborine, bansuri and cello) the sounds of which get mixed in battle music as well as pivotal moments in your campaign, crafting a really memorable experience.     As far as graphics go they definitely feel like an improvement. Especially the character models and the armor design are gorgeous, where in the first game characters felt small and rather generic looking, with not many visual changes affecting them along the way, this time around each character and race look unique, feel big, present and meaningful in the game's world. Landscapes are beautiful and monsters you encounter look nasty (in a good way) and threatening.   Overall, I am very VERY impressed with what I experienced in the game and absolutely cannot reccommend this game enough. You can really tell the game was made with love, passion and care. (A very rare thing to find in modern games). This is, I swear the best RPG I've ever played."

260,Mr.Yellow,565,16,6,"January 11, 2017",Recommended,201.4,"It's short and very much unfinished thus far, and yet has utterly surprised me by being one of the most fun co-op experiences I've had in a while. While it has some issues, for Early Access it has a level of polish unheard of in most games that aren't yet fully released (and also some that are).  The systems seem well thought out, 4 player multiplayer is a massive improvement, the game looks quite lovely not even just in raw graphics but more importanly in visual design, playing as the Red Prince and picking the most Vegeta like dialogue just to see what happens is funny to me, the combat is fun and just challenging enough, these are all good points in the game's favour.  But. There is but one thing that draws me in like a moth to a flame. I have never seen such levels of freedom and sandbox design in a fantasy RPG before to the extent where there's just so much room for player dickery. For example, my friend would start conversations with NPC's like some kind of Strangey McWeirdo who actually wants to advance the plot instead of committing petty crimes for even pettier reasons (I know right?). So, while he's talking, learning story and lore, and just generally enjoying the writing I decided to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• him over for a laugh.  Even outside of combat you can sneak as long as you don't enter an NPC's Line of sight, and the NPC's sight was focused on my poor friend and not her valuables and I. Needless to say I made off with her shoes, a potion, and some fish the last of which i sent to my friend's inventory as they were still talking. One (what I can only assume to be magical) cavity search later and my friend was in prison while I was grabbing many, many, crates all of which sell for 1 gold to get my pants back after a guard took them from me the last time I got busted for petty theft.  10/10 Would have a kleptomaniac episode again."

Plays like the first, but with a lot more to do in battles, around the world and interacting with NPCs and your party. Theres that same humor that the last game had, so youll still find those flavor items and people in the world. The graphics are beautiful and the world looks vibrant and captivating. The writing is as good, if not better then DSO, with an added narrator and voices with every NPC.

This is fine for me but you are currently only able to access the first act. There are plenty of bugs to be worked and features not yet added out as you would expect from an early access pre-beta release. That said, though, the first act is A+++  D:OS 2 is a  turn based RPG based on gear, skill points and abilities, elements etc. A strategic game for sure. This was exactly the sort of game I was looking for and expecting as I was a huge fan of the original.  This game manages to capture what made the original great and expand on it in so many ways, with the ability depth, more grim story and great style (even when running on a potato).  There are plenty of features still to be implimented (such as local coop) as one would expect from an early access release. That said, however, you can be at ease as this is a company that has illustrated clearly in the past that they deliver big time on any promises made during the development period.   Overall, if you're looking for a strategic, turn based RPG look no further."

Larian Studios really knocked this one out of the park with stunning visuals, soundtrack, voice overs, story, near flawless newtwork and online co-op. The list goes on and on. I could only wish all game releases were this way, so rich and full, without extra fluffs or DLC's hiding bits and pieces of it away.  About the only thing I could fault this for is not letting have the campaign assets for the GM mode, I want The Lady Vengeance map for a campaign darnit!   This game is a 10 out of 10, great package, worth every penny, would recommend it to anyone who likes RPG's. Even more fun if you play with friends, lord knows we all laughed and cried we found out how volatile mixing poison and fire is. Hehe..."

267,Pixlow,305,44,19,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,244.5,"Paid some pimp in a tavern a 100 gold for a prostitude. Went up to the prostitude and had a long good talk about how she should actually be paying me for it, then said ""Now that we have established who is the most desireable here, i will take my leave"". She got mad and said i couldn't get a refund. Little did she know that i already had stolen my money back from her pimp.   10/10 Would steal from pimps and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with prostitudes again.   But in all honesty the game is great, the story is much easier to follow now that it is voice acted in my personal opinion. Upon reaching Reaper's Coast i have experianced some slight problems with perfomance, but other than that, the game has been going smoothly.   The turn based combat gets spiced up by the ground effects, you can either make great use of those mechanics or they can be your doom. Saving before battle is recommended. When combat gets challenging there is no shame in reloading a save to come up with new strategies to defeat your foe. Running from combat might also be the smartest move in some situations.  The origin characters give a nice dynamic to the singleplayer game, having them in your party leads to some memorable events between you and them. When you interract with an npc they have interrest in, they will let you know, you can either allow them to do their buisness or keep them away. This will lead to you bonding with that character. If they do something you do not like, you can often have a talk about it afterwards.  The music in the game is pretty good, but sometimes there is some mishaps where a piece of music that is out place plays. Nothing gamebreaking, but you can lose a bit of your immersion. You are able to pick 1 of 4 instruments when you make a character, you will hear these instruments being played in the level up music and etc.  Persuasion checks have been a little confusing for me, sometimes when i believe i definantly should be able to pass the skill check for an option i fail and other times where i think i should have failed, i passed. No idea if it is randomized or how it works."

271,jimbobslimbob,243,10,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,128.1,"It's a turn-based isometric RPG which attempts to do what Sword Coast Legends never did: make a computer game that captured the essence of PnP, complete with campaign editor (not tried yet, since this is an EA review), GM mode and true RPG-freedom-of-choice. It is very similar to RPG's of old, like Neverwinter Nights, Baldurs Gate etc.  I have only completed Act 1 so far, since that's all that exists in the early access version, but I am hooked. The game is a joy to play. Difficult at times, yet rewarding too. It offers true freedom of choice in the way you play and create your character. It features a classless character system so you are free to do whatever you want with your character. It also features various ""origin"" characters which are kind of pre-generated characters with fleshed out backgrounds (the kind of thing you do yourself in a D&D campaign). You can choose to play one of those or alternatively make up your own and recruit them in game.  There are many ways to solve the quests in game, offering a lot of replay value. Race, ""tags"" (such as Outlaw etc.) all make NPC's treat you differently and offer various other ways to do things. The co-op gameplay (up to 4 players) has also been specifically designed with this in mind, meaning your party may not always see eye-to-eye on things. This creates the potential for some interesting RP scenarios.  Although the version I played does not yet feature a GM mode or level editor, this looks to be the icing on the cake and could significantly increase play-time. They will also offer Steam Workshop support for ""click-and-play"" modding.  Now all they need to do is offer the ability to import/export characters...  Summary Overwhelming to begin with, but once you get to grips with the game mechanics you realise just how well crafted this game is. Gorgeous graphics, wonderful sound and music, solid turn-based tactical combat and endless replay value.  Jimbo Rating: 8/10 "

273,Avigoat,9,15,1,August 5,Recommended,85.9,I would compare this game to the show death note where the first half is absolutley amazing but the second half is lackluster. The first half of the game in driftwood there are so many quests and things to do each quest just as interesting as the last with an immersive city that feels like its lived in but then in the second half when your're on the 3rd island idk what happened  it lost its magic with an island where all you do is pray infront of stones and there are no other quests than the one main storyline. When you reach arx after that very dissapointing island it gets a bit better there are some quests to do other than the main story and they are interesting as well. The combat through the entire game is great. Good progression to feel like your character is truly ready to become divine and if you play this game with a friend it is a great experience that for me kept me wanting to play this game till the end. This game is definitly worth the first 40 hours to immerse yourself in the world however the 3rd and 4th island of the game falls short to the rest.

282,Zurv,860,7,0,"October 16, 2017",Recommended,153.7,"This game is fantastic. One of the best RPGs I‚Äôve played.  Larian created a rich and living world to play in. The story (unlike the DOS1) is good with twists and turns. There are tons of side quest and normally multi ways to finish them. (yes, murdering everyone is an option‚Ä¶ but then you might miss out on more story/exp.) The interaction of ‚Äúsystems‚Äù they setup, from how elements react with other elements/spells to actions in the world people see you do. It makes for great combat and a lot of creative way how to deal with enemy/issues. I did play the first game (Divinity Original Sin) so I had an idea of how the game worked. (side note, there is no reason to play the first game. While great, it task soooo long to get going that many players will bounce off it.) I didn‚Äôt find the game or it‚Äôs systems confusing because of that.. maybe? Do not expect the game to tell you explicitly how to play. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù that you need to just work it out yourself. It will subttlely tell you how to play via the interface. My advice is take it slow. This is one of those games that you search everyone, read everything, talk to everyone. ÔÅä Save a lot. (f5 key) Not because it is hard, but you might change to change how some event is going once you see what is happening. Honestly my biggest ‚Äúproblem‚Äù with the game is a massive fear that I‚Äôm going to miss something. (which you can totally do.. it is very easy.) Did I miss some book? I did not ask the right question? Did I have a skill to low and missed seeing some hidden item/switch/etc‚Ä¶ argh! That said, there is so much here it isn‚Äôt a big deal to miss some side stuff. But.. but.. I want to see it all.. so.. there is some stress there. Getting to the last big area was very stressful for me as I started to feel overwhilemd  The quest log isn‚Äôt super great. It isn‚Äôt always clear what the next steps are‚Ä¶ but in the defense of the game it really isn‚Äôt a check list of this but more a log of what you are doing. (but it would still be nice if they said if X quest is going to end of it leave area Y or if it will keep going.)  Totally get this magical game, but do expect to bump into a learning curve if you‚Äôve not play RPGs before. (of course there is an ‚Äúexplorer‚Äù (or something like that) which might be a way to get into the game a little ez‚Äôr.) There is co-op in the game too.. but I personally don‚Äôt see how that would be fun. Each person in your party is a part of your strategy. Well, at least play with someone you know and not a rando. )  Most people will restart the game after a few hours after they get an idea how the party they want and rolls/skills they want. But don‚Äôt super stress it. After you leave the first island you‚Äôll be able to re-roll all you people skills/stats/etc (and as any times as you want.. free. The game isn‚Äôt setup to screw you over if you made a bad choice.  "

284,Xilil,57,14,0,"September 16, 2016",Recommended,127.9,"Everything that made Original Sin 1 is in here, plus loads of extras that add to the experience.  Character development now allows for much more flexibility. In OS1 it was pretty hard to make some original combos like a battlemage because of the way skills and attributes worked. Now it feels like characters are much more customizable to whatever crazy combination you want to have.  The graphics are also a huge improvement. The PBR-rendering makes everything look stunning while preserving the nice aesthetics of the first game.  The single player Act that is available to Early Acces offers a lot of content. The replayability is also quite high. There are quite a lot of ways to complete your goals, which will make every playthrough a bit different.   The only problem that I think this sequel still has, is that sometimes it's hard to find the content for your level. Because of this you sometimes end up just running around looking for those level 4's you still need to kill to level up.   I thought PvP was going to be kind of nice, but that is quite the understatement. The PvP is one of the best PvP experiences I had in a long time. There's so much depth to it, while still keeping it fun. This is were the additions in combat from Original Sin 1 really show their beauty with Source skills and tons of new surface combo's like blessed fire. I just hope there will be a matchmaking system eventually because the server browser isn't that good in my opinion. People try to put up private matches in public, so everytime someone joins they instantly kick them.  Which brings me to my last complaint, which is that the game visibility of single player is the same as the visibility of multiplayer. This means that if you want to play single player, and right after that create an arena lobby, you have to change the setting every single time.  In conclusion I think it still has its flaws which is normal ofcourse, but at its current state it is already a beautiful and fun game."

287,Sgt. McSergeantface,85,9,1,July 4,Recommended,237.0,"Why exactly you are reading reviews for Divinity: Original Sin 2? I doubt you were just browsing store. You were looking for RPG, don‚Äôt you? Or maybe you‚Äôve heard somewhere about this phenomenal game and just checking out. Or maybe you don‚Äôt actually trust this unstoppable hype train, do you?      TL; DR. Buy. Play. Replay. Get Enhanced for free. Replay.     Well, every praised thing you might have heard about this outstanding game is 100% true. My life is now divided into ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù Divinity: Original Sin 2.   Larian Studios - creators of Divinity - is company of people, that actually works with players and for players. I will remind you, it is an indie project financed on a crowdfunding platform. Game has inherited all the best parts from previous instance. However, it is an understatement to tell that OS2 improved things. Sequel has added so much more, it has surpassed every existing game and doubled, tripled the level of today‚Äôs RPGs, adding everything we didn‚Äôt dare to dream about.   We want to choose playable races! - Ok, here‚Äôs four. And you can make a playable undead character. We want more companions! - Fine. And they are living humans - play with three of your friends.   We want more magic and perks! - Here 4 more skill schools and mix them up to unlock more perks. We want to make love to our party members! - No problem. You also can punch ‚Äòem in a face anytime. We want personal quests! - Welcome playable characters with prewritten origins and their own story arc. We want more stories! - Here‚Äôs Game Master mode and dedicated modding support.   Everyone knows, how much time it takes sometimes to create your character: skills, abilities, talents, etc. Eventually it took me twice as much, because I just couldn‚Äôt stop admiring visual design of characters, feasting my eyes while scrolling different races and skill presets, to see as character‚Äôs model switches his looks. In addition to looks and technical part of your avatar, there are two notable things in character creation. First, if you build your own character (not pre-created), you can add some personality traits, which together with race will reflect on your social interactions (i.e. dialog options). Second, choose one of four musical instruments - game‚Äôs musical score will dynamically change leading instrument, when your character does something awesome. Imagine epic cello or bansuri solo when your hero is unleashing some hell on pity enemies! More to this: do not bother with perfect build, try fresh ideas, experiments and bold choices - Divinity will allow you to change your specs midgame numerous times if you think you‚Äôve messed up.   Combat system maybe the one thing that has changed heavily in sequel, a lot of things were reconsidered. For me personally it was hard to get used to changes right after first game, but in hours I‚Äôve found it even more satisfying. However, keep in mind that straightforward face punching still not the option. Tactics has moved into third dimension - do not underestimate high ground. And of course, don‚Äôt forget to utilize everything you can reach, that‚Äôs including you pockets and your surroundings. Found yourself standing fenced in a fire - use water barrel to extinguish it or bless fire and stand your fight in cleansing flames. Got bullied by a brute - teleport yourself out, or teleport enemy‚Äôs sorry‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•on lava. Some of most efficient tactics are those that not first come to mind.   Plot isn‚Äôt connected to Original Sin. Sequel is provided with its own overarching narrative and several personal story arcs of origin characters (which also serve as companions) and particular factions. Everything is interconnected in some complicated manner, it was the reason of bugs and some general frustration, because one path leads to impasse on other story thread (fixed by further patching). However, game doesn‚Äôt hold your hand and never questions your approach to advance the story. E.g., first thing you are tasked with after tutorial section - get out of concentration camp, and then you can look for someone to help you with this, help others for info on how to get out, murder your way out, lie your way out, or fly away, if you have the ability, without even meeting anyone. Plot progression is not just 3-4 options, but absolutely non-linear. Basically, you can roam where the wind blows the whole game, you will always find yourself on a right path.   World of Rivellon has changed. At first, after whole shiny hunky-dory previous game, it was tough to find yourself in a place that is harsh, cruel and mean as Wild West. People will lie to you, use you, and you absolutely will find yourself in a situation, where the line between good and evil is blurred into wide grey area, where all alignments are subjective. Look, I have lost the faith in what I had been doing halfway through and have to reconsider my view on things - it is impressive storytelling for a video game.   Music in game is kept on astonishing level, with memorable scores and even few actual songs, that are closely tied to game‚Äôs narrative. Soundtrack is notably adaptative to surroundings and players interactions. Thousands of lines of dialogs were voiced perfectly, with distinct accents and proper manners respective to in-game personalities. Surprising addition is in-game Narrator, that makes you journey more immersive and closer to tabletop gaming. Narrator‚Äôs commentary on things are so neat and detailed, you can basically enjoy your ride with eyes closed.   Persuasion, as a vital part in RPG gameplay, has changed. Creators ditched that awkward ‚Äúrock, paper, scissors‚Äù minigame, though there is no any kind of randomizer behind now. However, success not solely depends on your persuasion skill level: very neat thing is involving physical attributes into check, like trying to reason with someone adds your intelligence bonus, while intimidating is much easier with high strength.   Most of the game earlier criticism was based on overabundance of bugs, inconsistencies and even script deadlocks. However, Larian never stopped patching and fixing and up all holes and mistakes, therefore every month after release players received long lists of patch notes. As for now most of things are shiny, polished and perfectly balanced. Moreso, Larian is readying an Enhanced Edition for release, where everything is refined and glossy, and with reworked third and fourth chapters of the story, which got their fair share of judgement from players. No point of waiting for release, as owners of current version will receive a new one.   Divinity OS2 requires your time and energy investment. There is so much in this phenomenal game, you are not able to treat it as a casual walk in a park. Managing characters party, inventory and crafting, diving deep into each story, heck, even most of the important combat encounters are challenging and will take a lot more time that you think, with all the tactical possibilities. However, if you are ready to enter immense world of fantasy, magic, political intrigue, adventure, love and betrayal - there is no better way than playing Divinity: Original Sin 2."

291,A Catgirl is Fine Too,394,20,2,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,108.5,"The first Original Sin game was my favorite title of 2014, and I have been impatiently waiting for the sequel from the moment I finished it. I am pleased to report that it has been well worth the wait. Larian Studios have a fundamental understanding of what makes a good sequel: Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps the things that made the original great, and builds on the areas that were lacking.   The art design is even more stunning than before, and the one act currently available is packed with things to do. I've already found numerous clever ways to solve both major and minor quests. Combat, arguably the most important aspect of the game, has remained largely the same, with the addition of new mechanics such as height and cursed surfaces to keep things fresh. The plot in the first game was one of my few complaints, as it felt generic and poorly paced in places. However, in Original Sin 2 I find myself much more intrigued and very much like what I have seen of the story so far. Although the game is still in early access as I write this, it already feels like a straight upgrade from Original Sin 1.  As far as criticism goes, the music currently feels slightly lackluster, although being able to choose a special instrument to play during climactic moments is a novel idea. One of my complaints from the first game was that by the end of it, combat had begun to feel tedious. As I said, combat is still fundamentally the same, but I have yet to explore all the new features and I hope they keep combat exciting across my multiple inevitable playthroughs.   Of course, as an early access title, bugs and glitches come with the territory, but I have yet to experience a game-breaking one. I am currently playing on ultra on a moderately powerful laptop, and performance has been stable, with an average FPS of 60-65.   In conclusion, did you like Divinity: Original Sin? If yes, you'll love this one too. If for some reason you didn't, you're not going to find a completely new experience here, although it might have fixed what you disliked. If you're new to the franchise, I'd always suggest buying the finished first game over the unfinished early access game, but if you're a fan of turn-based RPGs you'll likely get more than your money's worth. I have a huge amount of respect for Larian Studios and I don't doubt for a second that Divinity: Original Sin 2 will only get better from here. "

293,axfelix,267,13,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,113.0,"Man, it's so good. They took what was already the most flexible, fun, and modern CRPG out there and made the engine even more expansive and the game weirder and more interesting.  I would actually recommend playing the first one first if you haven't; it's not really needed for plot reasons (there are a few returning characters but nothing major) but it's a little easier to get a handle on, hardly any less impressive, and in the meantime this sequel could probably still use another few months of polish patches. It's hardly anything to hold against it given the scope, and I didn't hit a single bug I'd consider really significant, but the farther you get into the game the more broken the quest flags start to feel and the more minor continuity issues the dialogue starts to have and the more combat balance starts to break. This is all after like 30+ hours, mind you (I'm up to 50 and not quite done yet, which is unheard of for me)."

300,Dralek,315,6,1,"October 6, 2017",Recommended,294.2,"This game is amazing.  I can't stop playing it.  Let's start out with the first thing you do in the game; character customization.  You have 4 races to choose from, each with their own unique traits, backstory, and affect how everyone treats you.  Lizards can dig without a shovel, Dwarves can crawl into small spaces nobody else can, Elves can eat body parts to learn the memories of the fallen (sometimes gaining skills in the process), and so forth.  You've got a lot of choices for playstyles as well, and it's not set in stone.  You could start off the game as a wizard, then transition into a battlemage who charges into the fray, then unleashes spells that require proximity.  Then, you've got the Tags.  Basically, they let you set up your own backstory, as well as giving additional dialogue options when the time is right.  Mystics can sometimes talk to the gods, whilst Barbarians want a *simple* solution to many problems.  But the best is yet to come...  and it's something that I'm a bit of a sucker for.  Music.  You can set the lead instrument on the soundtrack.  It's only four instruments, and the one you choose will be, well, the prominent instrument throughout the soundtrack.  Not a fan of character customization?  That's fine, you can select an Origin character.  These guys normally would be optional party members if you were to create your own character, but you can also play as them for your main character.  The choices are really interesting too; a lizard who cavorted with demons and got exiled, wanting to reclaim his empire; or a human who is a host of all kinds of spirits while a demon is trying to wrest control of her body.  They all have pre-set tags, but you can choose the class they start with.  Now for the gameplay.  Out of battle, stuff is simple; everything is performed from your clicking (duh).  However, even outside of combat your skills are still tested.  Persuasion can be a way to get out of a fight, or get more information out of someone, bartering lowers prices for you.  You can also steal stuff too, but be warned if you played the first game; the stealing has been revamped by quite a lot.  You can no longer just walk into someone's house, close the door and sneak about, stealing everything that isn't bolted down.  The moment you take something, no matter if you're sneaking or not, the townsfolk will become suspicious and try to search you.  Of course, there's ways to make sure they don't succeed, but I'll leave that since a lot of this game is about finding your own playstyle.  The combat is not really changed by much from the first game, but many more complexities have been added.  Surfaces play a crucial role to a mage just like before, however they have many more options due to the magic trees.  Water can be frozen, electrified, or turned into steam which can also be electrified.  Bless can actually turn surfaces, well, blessed, healing characters who travel through it.  (That includes everyone, so make sure blessed surfaces can't be accessed by the enemy.)  However, there is also Cursed surfaces, which carry extra effects to them.  Necrofire can't be put out by normal water, Cursed Oil can go off on MOVEMENT, and so forth.  Armor is no longer a stat that simply decreases damage received, it is instead its own bar.  This bar is crucial to manage, as it stops status effects.  Think of it as a shield; as long as you have a shield up, you can't be affected by the status of a surface your character may be standing on, with certain exceptions as Oil that slows you down.  As a general rule of thumb however, the game's combat is very challenging.  There really isn't many fights that have ""cannon fodder"" enemies; everyone is dangerous and they all know how to take advantage of the same things you do.  Be careful about that water you're standing on, for that mage on higher ground likely might have an electric spell he could cast, if your magic armor is down, and stun you.  My recommendation?  This game deserves all the praise that it's got and more.  The only real complaint I have is with the camera control, but that's mainly due to my mouse having issues with some games not registering the middle mouse click.  Plus, in battle you can get a top-down view if there's too many obstacles."
301,Dogg,196,6,0,"November 18, 2017",Recommended,110.3,"**spoiler free**  What a fantastic journey. Every once in a while, you get incredibly hyped for that next game that's about to come out... and every so often, that very game delivers on the hype. This game ultimately did that for me, and I'm almost sad that the journey is now over (unless I start another new game). Starting each category at 10 points.   Visuals: starting at +10 ================ The game's graphics look fantastic. There is a vast amount of polished detail in each and every environment. The developers didn't leave anything out. Even areas you may only explore once, if only for a couple of minutes, got all the same polished details as areas that you'll be spending hours upon hours inside of. Brilliant, long, hard work went into sewing the fields of this game's visuals, and the developers are reaping the fantastic benefits of that hard work. Well done.  + No real cons here. I never had any screen tearing and rarely saw any seams throughout the world.  Final score: 10/10    Sound/Music: +10 ============= For anyone who has read my past reviews, you'll know I use the word ""weight"" a lot when it comes to sound effects. This ""weight"" means that for each and every major sound effect in the game, there should typically be some kind of ""impact"" behind them. It doesn't have to be a big ""boom"" for that to work. It can be the sounds of butterfly wings flapping in the wind (which would be incredibly hard to hear), or it can be a loud thunderbolt. Either way, whichever object or environment a sound effect has been stuck in/onto, it has to have a strong feeling behind it. This is not easy to explain, but let's just say that Divinity Original Sin 2 pulls it off extremely well.  + All abilities sound effects, even ones that are as simple as throwing a dagger, feel heavy. There is strength behind them. No ability is left out, nothing is in the ""filler"" category. Excellent.  + Music appears to be orchestra, and it's great. Battle music pumps you up. ""Majestic"" music calms you down, and provides a sense of relief behind it. It all sounds fantastic.  + Pre-final battle music setup is excellent (only those who've played the game will understand).  + Great voice work across all characters, both major and minor.  Final score: 10/10    Performance: +10 ============= Overall, the game runs well.   + When everything is working, it performs at 60 FPS, constantly.  +/- Long long load times between regions. I mark this as neither a plus or a minus due to the fact that once you're loaded in, there are no load times whatsoever. The game loads everything upon entry (this is why is takes so long).  - Bugs bugs and more bugs. Nothing game breaking fortunately. A common theme when it comes to Larian Studios games. The good news is, most bugs are extremely minor. Quest bugs WILL be contracted, inhibiting you from actually completing a quest. Other quest related bugs include 1) actually completing a quest, but it never leaving your quest log. 2) you have option A and option B to choose from. You chose option A, but the game will say you chose option B. -1  - Certain battles have frustrating situations where a turn will not end immediately, forcing you to wait for up to 5-10 minutes at a time for each turn to finally end (even though nothing is happening). This will hopefully be patched in the near future. It was not patched in this playthrough. -1  - Game will crash every now and then. -1  - Strange lag issues in regards to certain spells (such as blood storm). These lag issues will persist until the specific spell (or spells) animations have completely ended, sometimes several turns after being cast. -1  Final score: 6/10   Story: +10 ======== You are a source wielder. You've been captured and you're about to sent to what would closely resemble a ""prison island"" to serve out your remaining days. It's time to escape! This is where the adventure begins.  + Premade characters all have an actual personality that you will love or hate. It will slowly be fleshed out as the story progresses, whether for better or for worse. Whichever character you pick (or don't pick, you can make your own too) will still have their main story attached, but you get to make a plethora of extra decisions behind them that will ultimately influence their endgame personality. So don't be afraid to pick the premades (you can also edit their classes and appearances).  + Relevant in-game choices that will affect the endings.  + Special endings for certain characters are available.  - Some scenes would have a far greater impact if it wasn't simply reading text. A few animations here and there wouldn't hurt, especially behind big scenes (that would normally be a cutscene vs an interactable scene). -1  Final score: 9/10    Gameplay: +10 =========== Gameplay hinges upon building your starting character with either physical, magical, or ranged damage types (ranged being both physical and magical, depending on if you're an archer or a mage). You'll run around and collect lots of loot, sell the loot, buy better loot; craft items, scrolls, and potions; learn a vast amount of abilities and even craft secret ""hidden"" abilities; there is plenty to do here, and you will be busy, all while having fun (hopefully).  + Respec any time once you hit Act 2, for free. This will actually probably enrage some players, because they want to feel the weight of locking in their choice of permenant abilities (i.e. Diablo 2). Respecing for me on the other hand was the greatest thing to ever happen in this game. I started as a Battlemage, switched to a full time mage, and then later switched to a mostly full-timer tank/DPS with certain mage support abilities attached. I had another character start as a full healer and supporter, who later stayed as a full healer supporter, but also had fire and ice abilities to help in combat, if they couldn't do anything else. You can experiment to your heart's delight. So get past Act 1, then indulge in the world of change!  + You can play as a skeleton, with facial hair.  + Various unique abilities for each race are well implemented and can provide extra benefits to playing a certain class with a certain race (such as a thief/assassin with an undead, due to getting a free skeleton key to unlock any chest provided you have high enough Thievery skill. No need to buy lockpicks!)  + Crowd control in this game is just as fantastic as it was in the first game, with a vast amount of new CC abilities (like sleeping).  + The addition of Armor and Magic Armor is also fantastic, providing you with protection against CC abilities of both the physical and magical aspects until that chosen armor is depleted (unless you have Glass Cannon).  + Playing with friends is a lot of fun.  +/- Some talents in the game feel wholly useless (Demon and Ice King), while others feel overpowered. I mark this as plus or minus simply because you can respec at any given time. It would only benefit to take certain ""less useful"" talents to quick specific areas of the game, then respec again back to whatever you were originally with. That being said...  - I played the game on Tactician mode (which is basically hard mode) and having a slightly higher fire resistance or slightly lower ice resistance never really made that big of a difference. The enemies in this mode having such incredibly strong physical or magical abilities would typically negate your armor too too quickly, and 15% out of 100% is just not very helpful. Leadership was a much better option, and also freed up the ""wasted"" talent points. These less useful abilites are what you would call ""filler"". -1  Final score: 9/10    Overall: 8.8/10 (44/50 = 0.88) ===================== A well delivered fine wine that will age almost indefinitely for days to come. Will sip on again. Great job to the developers."

On that note, play the first game first, it's great, and if you like it then come to this one. The two big notes I have about this game are that it's dumb you can freely respec, and tactician mode is a major dissapointment compared to tactician mode in the first game. It's predominantly just an enemy stat buff (+50% to damage, vitality, and armor) and that's about it. It's most just artificial difficulty for if you played the game through a few times and want to have it challenge you again.

309,Marcus Butthurticus,"1,198",8,0,May 2,Recommended,170.9,"This game is really a master piece in the RPG genre in modern times.  Simply put it is a charming game with wonderful enviroment in a world that is deeper than one might think. It takes silly bit to far at times but never as far as lets say Borderlands 2 did which to me, ruined the whole game. Original Sin 2 is both a silly and grim story. The turnbased combat is excellent and it works so well with others. Prepare for a lot of backstabs if you play with nasty people! And prepare for twists.   There is not a better multiplayer RPG this side of Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2. The builds you can do are plenty and races bring their own special abilities, especially Elf and Undead have some unique mechanics, like eating body parts to gain memories of the dead and even abilities at times or Undead....being Undead.   There is at times some weird things. Like AI going nuts and doing not so optimal things or certain questlines not working correctly. RPGs with long questlines that the player sometimes managed to screw up by circumventing things by being cheesy is a classic thing in RPGs, The more advanced endings and options for a questline, the more keen to it breaking it is.   Beside these problems, Original Sin 2 is a excellent game, with nice character building, this is probably one of the strongest parts of the game! Just going nuts when it comes to builds. NPCs that are not so bad, Interesting characters and a developed world. Only thing I would want is a longer end act. The last settlement you are in could been a bit bigger to symbolize the size of it. For the next  game I hope to more of the same, even if it has to be crazy AI and questlines that is not always triggered in the correct way. I hope to see a Original Sin 3 in the coming years.  EDIT: I must point out that the issues could all stem from us taking breaks over a month at times which could off have broken things between patches. The game usually works very well otherwise."

Many ways to discover new quests, and many more ways to solve them, rewards creativity and thinking outside the box.

On the downside, there are some balancing issues, UI could be much improved, a fair bit of wrong or placeholder text and content showing up later in the game, and a few bugs. But otherwise a rewarding experience that I want to immidately return to again, after beating for the first time. And I rarely play the same game more than once."

322,TheokolesTW,97,12,3,"September 16, 2016",Recommended,76.9,"The worst aspect of playing this in Early Access is that even though you're getting to play the game - you still have to wait until they release the final, finished version.  It's going to be tough to wait it out. Because now I know just how good it will be.  The game plays much like the first - just better. It's design, the more polished and tweaked systems. I've been playing with a friend who is new to the series and honestly I laugh when I tell him about some of the systems in place.  ""Yeah so you can teleport that bad guy and drop him on that bad guy and they'll both get hurt.""  Or  ""Right, did you pick up that corpse's leg? Oh, well pick it up and we'll take it to an Elf so they can eat and tell us where to go next.""  Or  ""I'm not sure what to do, we might want to talk to that cat.""  Lol.  Playing this game by yourself is great - playing with another person, or better in a larger group... man this game is gold.   I've still got a lot of play left in this game - but I dread finishing it and having to wait for the rest. So I'm taking my time. If I can spend a couple of extra hours where someone else would take only 1 I'll be a happy bunny.  Anyways, if you like this sort of game (and honestly who wouldn't?) do yourself a favour and pick this up for you and a friend. Just remember to come into it with the knowledge you're going to have to wait until next year for the full thing."

324,LugdunonTG,744,16,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,91.7,I loved Divinity: Original Sin both in Co-op and Single player. The first time I played it was that same feeling in D&D when you realise you can do nearly anything. Divinity: Original Sin 2 carries on this legacy incredibly well already considering it's early state. In the short time I've played I met a host of weird and interesting characters. Stumbled upon various quests that aren't just in plain site.  This is the way I love my RPG's this game rewards you for exploring and taking risks. Just because the odds seem against you does not mean they are as long as you use the environment to your advantage. Blood puddles on the floor can become electrified to shock people on them. You can contaminate them to poison people and use fire to cause poison to combust. It's a wonderful game that I feel like will improve on the original in every way once it's finished. The early version does contain bugs and is obviously missing many aspects but if you wanna just mess around with builds or the new PvP modes then now is as good a time to jump in as any as long as you realise its not fully fleshed out YET. High recommendation from me for all RPG fans.   https://youtu.be/LxvdYIl1IMI  Here's some Gameplay if you wish to see more and I may consider making this a series with enough interest otherwise I check back every few updates.

329,myhv,121,5,0,"November 27, 2017",Recommended,613.6,"It's ok for a few evenings...   But seriously, where do I even start? Probably with the best advice I can give: play this in multiplayer! There are discords dedicated to finding and hosting groups, no need to hope for a reply on the steam forums or join random groups in the browser. It's so much more enjoyable, but frustrating at the same time. Learn to love fort joy, as you'll be restarting many times. It took me good ~30 groups to find someone to finish the game with. Thankfully (and sadly) first act is the best made one, and there's a lot to do there.   Main reason why I would recommend this game is not it's story, or some innovative features and approaches, but it's replayability. Even 300+ hours in I found combat enjoyable, each fight a challenge, with a chance to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up. There are some rather clever mechanics to learn and abuse, unique skills to master, builds to optimize and routes to find.   The game is well worth your money and time, despite it's shortcomings.   Speaking of which... Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of things wrong with the game. From expected (but not liked) bugs and glitches - on my last playthrough we had at least 3 bugged quests, a bunch of issues with stuck characters and desyncs - to more serious problems.   Story is passable at best. It will not keep you awake or amaze you in the end. Sidequests are often more engaging than the main plot line.   Armor system is very restricting for the most of the game, especially on the higher difficulties. It pretty much forces you in to using only physical or magical (typically physical) damage, as you need to strip the armor before controls can be used, and controls are mandatory for the most of the game. Yes, sure eventually you can get one spell room clearing mages, but that's late game, and that's not what you will be doing most of the time. Arguably mages are gimped up to level 12, which is a good half of the game. Once again, this is highest difficulty level, but this is where it gets fun.   There is also serious lack of skills, or variety, to be precise. It's fine for first game, but later you start to notice it more. And so many skills are very situational, or subpar, so you generally use ~5 constantly and a few for utility. It's specially notable between melee classes, as a rogue, knight(2h weapons), warrior(sword and board) and metamorph will use the same warfare skills, as they are core to being a melee, and not their ""subclass"" variations. There are also crafted skills, combining 2 schools, but combinations are between magical and physical schools, meaning you will rarely even see them.   There is very little to do outside of combat, except preparing for combat or picking up quests before you go fight stuff for the quests. A bit lacking from a cRPG.   Several of the systems feel unfinished, lacking purpose. Crafting seems like a huge part of the game initially, but you only really craft runes and lockpicks. Potions, scrolls, food and grenades quickly become useless, even healing potions are disappointing in the endgame. Scrolls hold up the longest, but not the offensive one, only the ones that can remove status effects. NPC attitude value is a glorified discount program.   AI ""cheats"" a lot. No one will suspect you as an undead (or having the zombie trait) outside of combat, but once initiated, get ready to receive all the healing spells. And they will forget it immediately after. Enemies will know where exactly to move, to avoid a minefield of line of sigh obstacles and smoke blockers, just to get that single possible shot on their turn.   But all of that said, I still enjoyed the hell out of my time with the game. Sure, maybe the abysmal state of PC gaming this year and lack of good RPG games in general is partially to blame, but I think there's more to it.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for a game they can immerse themselves in."
330,Maev,181,5,0,"May 1, 2017",Recommended,116.2,"Although the difficulty is extremly high, a bit to high for release i like it. Some fight take multiple attempts and really cheesy tactics like deploying rogue in the back of a boss with all buffs and then initiating the fight :D Also you have the next lvl of making advantage of elements, especially of your blessing skill which seems the most important one in the game, eg. fire which can transform fire into holy fire.

Don't get me wrong, i love tyranny, Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland, Shadowrun, torment, etc. and i stil play the infinity engine games.  But by the gods, this game just blew them out of the water. From soundtrack to gameplay, this game is a masterpiece.  And in my opinion stands tall allongside the great Crpg's of old.

Although PoE is a formidable competitor in the CRPG industry, it still falls short of Larian's inspired craft.  -Truly immersive and imaginative, you will lose yourself in this world for weeks/months/maybe years.  The dialogue in this game is so well written, I feel like I'm reading a novel with each interaction, in a good way.  -Open world exploration and discovery is highly rewarding and equally challenging, as undiscovered secrets and side quests seem endless, and dangerous.  You happen upon a dirt pile, ask your companion for a shovel, dig it up to find a deep hole leading to something. You enter said deep hole to find a lair of angry and hungry spiders.  You defeat the spider menace to find a man's corpse, and a bloody journal, which leads you on a daring adventure.  Meanwhile, you were already on a daring adventure before you started down this path!  -Customization is extremely advanced, where each and every aspect of your characters' reputation, skills, abilities, and even speech are at your fingertips.  You can easily spend hours in character creation, days in tweaking your playstyles, and weeks/month doing it all over again on separate playthroughs.  -Impressive cooperative Multiplayer that brings an excellent experience to the game.  This is a heavily under-utilized aspect of the game, but if you have friends who enjoy turn-based RPGs, there is nothing quite like working as a team and experiencing the magic together.  It is very remincient to table-top roleplaying, except in a kickass game.  -Amazingly high replayability with options for unique interactions that inspire a renewed sense of purpose.  Even though I only have early access, I have played the game through three times already, and that was just the first Act of the game!  -Obsessive attention to detail with a mastery of storytelling, Larian poured their souls into this title, it's alive!  I rarely say that I love a game.  I love this game.  This isn't a game, this is a masterpiece of design, and I'm very happy Larian has given this wonderful experience to the world. Will you join us?

337,DurkaDog,300,5,0,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,253.7,"This game is a change in the right direction in the game industry, these past few years many game companies have been abusing their power for more marketing and microtransactions thus ignoring their communities for what they want. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a turn-based, RPG, tactical combat game for up to 4 players where you have many possiblies to play as different roles in well driven story as a savior among the people. What shocked me the most was when I found out that this game was brought up by a kickstarter. Finding out that Larian Studios conisisted of 130 employees baffled me that AAA games could be so corrupted by greed that it ruins the gameplay and to have a series like Divinity whose company focuses on develping their games rather than trying to polish it up for marketing purposes puts all AAA games to shame."

341,Finjas,100,5,0,"October 8, 2017",Recommended,87.3,"When I finished the first Original Sin, I thought that was the highest point for Larian Studios. It had everything great about oldschool RPGs and more, it was inventive in both gameplay mechanics and story. It had an interesting world to explore. Could they possibly top that?  Divinity OS2 shows how hard they worked for it. It's a huge improvement on something that was already great.  The core basically didn't change all that much. Game mecahinics are the same, although reworked a lot: balance is much better. The inclusion of Physical and Magic armour makes it so much simplier (not easier!) to plan out your tactics in battle. Writing has changed too. It's now trying to be something like the game master narrates the whole thing to you instead of letting you expierence everything in first person. The change may seem dubious, but it works here for one simple reason - D:OS 2 feels like a tabletop RPG all through. The changes are subtle, but they do a lot. The First game was a solid CRPG expierence. This one, though, because of the changes, -- the writing, the mechanics, co-op, -- this is something more. It's no longer just a CRPG. The trailer didn't lie! No matter how you choose to play, you'll expierence endless layers of pen and paper RPG depth! So much potential for roleplaying. Even if you play alone.  The game leads you to an adventure you get sucked into. The adventure you won't soon forget if you stick to the end.  And the story, especially if you play as one of the preset characters, is just fantastic. I don't remember when was the last time I hesitated so much about making story-related choices in games. Or even not story-related. Some side quests made me do things I feel so conflicted about even now! Love it.  Games like this make me remember why I like games more than just as a time killing medium. And Larian manages to remind me about it over and over again for... oh, dear, 15 years already!"

Since this is early access there are a lot of missing sounds and also the narration doesn't seem to be complete yet. I have my hopes way up for this game as I really LOVED divinity original sin. Haven't really played much of this one aside from the beginning area and all I can say is it looks better than the first game and there are some nice changes as well. I like how fortify is similar to stoneskin from old RPG games like neverwinter nights. Only personal grip I have are the elves. They remind me of the Na'Vi from avatar. Wish they went with a more traditional elven look but that is just my personal opinion.
343,Francis,409,5,0,"September 29, 2017",Recommended,290.3,"Highly recommend this game. Even if you're not a typical fan of computer rpgs. Everything is voice acted, which means eyes glossing over reading walls of text for hours straight doesn't happen. The combat is fun and the game feels really polished. There is a couple things they're tweaking/balancing which will polish everything out, not to say there is huge issues however.  My biggest gripe with the game is that itemization is a little unrewarding. Majority of the time, a uncommon items of a tier higher than rares, epics and even uniques of a teir below is strictly better. That's not fun imo, so it makes managing gear sometimes annoying/tedious vendoring shoping for upgrades each level.   Multiplayer is great, and I'm already stoked to replay the game adding that element."

But, the main flesh of this game lie in the GM mode. The freedom of expression given to the GM is almost as deep as an actual pan and paper campaign. If you have a decent GM and players, fun will be had. I hope to see more players making the jump to GM and creating unique campaigns. I would gladly pay for more GM mode content, allowing for further customization and freedom to tell your/my story. I spent at least 120hrs just building my campaign ""Olboria"" and still find room for improvement within the world and story. I plan to continue to revise and balance my campaign through multiple runs. If you're a fan on pen and paper rpgs, but dont have any local friends to play with, this is the game for you!

My PC can only handle it on Medium but it's still really pretty and run smooth. The first thing that will hit you though is how magical the soundtrack is. The people who did the music really knocked it out of the park.  One of the new feature is the Origin Story which is basically premade characters with independant questlines meaning that if you play with someone and you choose a different character than you'll have things to do that the other won't and the same for them. I'm not a big fan of fixed character but the story of the one I went with (Lohse) is pretty interesting so far. Even if you choose one of the Origin Stories you still can customize your character's hair, hair color, Skin color, facetype and class.  I haven't played a lot but I'm already hooked.

Don't get me wrong, i love tyranny, Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland, Shadowrun, torment, etc. and i stil play the infinity engine games.  But by the gods, this game just blew them out of the water. From soundtrack to gameplay, this game is a masterpiece.  And in my opinion stands tall allongside the great Crpg's of old. I will become a god, divinity original sin 2 just became my all time RPG to play.  Thank you Larian studio's. (and if you ever read this, i hope i will see your team again at facts someday). Sorry for the bad english, and enjoy this beauty. ---------------------------------------  finnished the game. Just became my altime favorite rpg. It has pushed Baldurs gate 2 from the top spot.

358,myhv,121,5,0,"November 27, 2017",Recommended,613.6,"It's ok for a few evenings...   But seriously, where do I even start? Probably with the best advice I can give: play this in multiplayer! There are discords dedicated to finding and hosting groups, no need to hope for a reply on the steam forums or join random groups in the browser. It's so much more enjoyable, but frustrating at the same time. Learn to love fort joy, as you'll be restarting many times. It took me good ~30 groups to find someone to finish the game with. Thankfully (and sadly) first act is the best made one, and there's a lot to do there.   Main reason why I would recommend this game is not it's story, or some innovative features and approaches, but it's replayability. Even 300+ hours in I found combat enjoyable, each fight a challenge, with a chance to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up. There are some rather clever mechanics to learn and abuse, unique skills to master, builds to optimize and routes to find.   The game is well worth your money and time, despite it's shortcomings.   Speaking of which... Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of things wrong with the game. From expected (but not liked) bugs and glitches - on my last playthrough we had at least 3 bugged quests, a bunch of issues with stuck characters and desyncs - to more serious problems.   Story is passable at best. It will not keep you awake or amaze you in the end. Sidequests are often more engaging than the main plot line.   Armor system is very restricting for the most of the game, especially on the higher difficulties. It pretty much forces you in to using only physical or magical (typically physical) damage, as you need to strip the armor before controls can be used, and controls are mandatory for the most of the game. Yes, sure eventually you can get one spell room clearing mages, but that's late game, and that's not what you will be doing most of the time. Arguably mages are gimped up to level 12, which is a good half of the game. Once again, this is highest difficulty level, but this is where it gets fun.   There is also serious lack of skills, or variety, to be precise. It's fine for first game, but later you start to notice it more. And so many skills are very situational, or subpar, so you generally use ~5 constantly and a few for utility. It's specially notable between melee classes, as a rogue, knight(2h weapons), warrior(sword and board) and metamorph will use the same warfare skills, as they are core to being a melee, and not their ""subclass"" variations. There are also crafted skills, combining 2 schools, but combinations are between magical and physical schools, meaning you will rarely even see them.   There is very little to do outside of combat, except preparing for combat or picking up quests before you go fight stuff for the quests. A bit lacking from a cRPG.   Several of the systems feel unfinished, lacking purpose. Crafting seems like a huge part of the game initially, but you only really craft runes and lockpicks. Potions, scrolls, food and grenades quickly become useless, even healing potions are disappointing in the endgame. Scrolls hold up the longest, but not the offensive one, only the ones that can remove status effects. NPC attitude value is a glorified discount program.   AI ""cheats"" a lot. No one will suspect you as an undead (or having the zombie trait) outside of combat, but once initiated, get ready to receive all the healing spells. And they will forget it immediately after. Enemies will know where exactly to move, to avoid a minefield of line of sigh obstacles and smoke blockers, just to get that single possible shot on their turn.   But all of that said, I still enjoyed the hell out of my time with the game. Sure, maybe the abysmal state of PC gaming this year and lack of good RPG games in general is partially to blame, but I think there's more to it.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for a game they can immerse themselves in."

Now before you say it was not perfect, let me say there is no such thing as perfection, we seek it and hopefully never find it. DOA was brilliant and that is a fact, not an opinion.  DOA2 well its ""more of the same"", and I know when people usually say that it is followed by a sigh and resignation and usually ""Uh"".  However not in the case of DOA2 it does all the DOA tick boxes but adds more, and I mean more in a very good way.  An example is when you start out in DOA2 you will find that crafting plays an important part of getting better equipment to survive.  There are even more ways to complete quests and some ways you can avoid quests, for example there are various ways to leave and some require a clever tongue others brute force or stealth and so much more.  The character backgrounds are an interesting and tease you with a more interesting and some quite meaningful motivation for escape and progression.

372,Shogoki,91,42,5,February 25,Not Recommended,31.9,"Divinity 2: Original Sin is beautiful, with a great soundtrack and the world design is also appealing. But i'm not gonna recommend it and here's why.  The game counters it's own logic. Tells you to do whatever you wants, put an emphasis on freedom, character creation, dialogue, roleplay, etc, but you must play EXACTLY like the developpers intended you to if you wanna succeed. That means, finishing as much quests as you can so your level is high enough for you to be able to win fights on your own terms. So the optional quests are in fact, mandatory. You don't like some quests ? Too bad, since you cannot grind because the mobs don't respawn. But that's not the whole story about quests. The maps are quite open, giving you the illusion of freedom, but when you discover a map for the first time, you'll realise that most of it is gated by high level mobs that are going to kill you outright if you engage combat against them, thus restricting the exploration the game strangely emphases, and forcing your hand into doing things in the exact order the devs wanted you to do them. If you try to do quest B before quest A, you will die because of how much a one or two level difference with your opponent means. That's not to mention the fact that some quests are gated behind a perk/stat/item requirment. It's like Cat Mario / Syobon Action, where you have levels loaded with traps and obstacles you can't possibly anticipate, so you finish them by dying on every single obstacle at least once and memorizing safe zones.  The combat system is also restricting, because of the way armor works, it's much more rewarding to set up all your characters into doing one type of damage (physical or magical) to finish fights quicker.  I wanted a wizard to support my knight but that would have been a bad idea. Because why would anyone lose time into emptying a full magical armor bar if the physical one has been grinded to zero through the physical attacks you already delivered ? Being able to do damage by mixing chemicals and using the environment is a good idea, the bad thing is that those chain-reactions are usually triggered early in the fight, be it by your own attacks or your opponent's, at a time where armors are not destroyed yet, thus nullifying many effects or debuffs they could create.  Nobody is sitting there, being like ""Omg this game is too hard, i can't advance !"" - people ARE advancing, but it is tedious and annoying. Not because it is ""omg, so oldschool, so hardcore"", but because the game fails to hold true to it's own principles and employs point-&-click adventure logic in many places. You are supposed to magically know how the devs wants you to approach a particular quest, area or fight. If you don't, you are going to fail, miss things, and die a lot. A good example of that would be Braccus pants. An item you can only find if your character is over a certain threshold in a certain stat, and make him interact with a particular item at a particular place, while nothing pointed that you should do that. There is a difference between not holding the player's hand and dumping them into a situation that cannot be managed unless you already have first hand experience or information.  So yeah, i wanted to love this game but it is simply not amusing. It's not a challenge in the sense that you have to improve your level of comprehension of mechanics that make sense, it's simply a matter of knowing things in advance. In Dark Souls, you can win fights on your own terms by, let's say, becoming very good at avoiding attacks and counter-attacking. Or you can be a god at min-maxing, setting up stats the right way to make a great build that's gonna make the game much easier. In DoS:2, you cannot win on your own terms. I should not have to steal every painting in the game to keep my economy flowing so i can buy gear to stay relevant in battle. I should not have to kill every non-quest related NPC so i can grind all the XP not to get crushed in battle. I should not have to back-stab bosses without talking to them and miss important story elements or sacrifice my amusement because of cheesy tactics being the only way to win some fights.  This ""You have to know it before you even attempt"" mechanic is not bad as is. I have no real problem with games that does that, however, i have one if they advertise themselves as putting the emphasis on player choice while it's clearly not how the game is designed to be played."

383,Blackadar,366,6,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,115.9,"Almost copy/paste of the original DoS2 review, this has been updated for the new edition.  I could just about copy and paste my D:OS review for D:OS 2. The short versions is that if you liked D:OS you'll like 2. If you didn't enjoy the first you won't like the second. So if you have experience with the first title, there's your answer. You can stop reading now. The rest of this review is aimed at those who haven't played the first game.  I thought the first was a GOTY contender in 2014 and I think #2 is a GOTY contender in 2017. But it's going to get tougher to keep recommeding this series when the same bugs and flaws keep showing up. So let's start with those flaws.  1. The obscure quests still remain from the original and you often have no idea how to move a quest forward or where to go next. The quest log is still quite useless. Some quests are quite obscure looking for objects that you may have uncovered (or not) including at least one with an object from a prior area. 2. Some screens are too much of a pixel hunt and the highlight button doesn't highlight most objects.  3. The difficulty curve is, frankly, stupid. Larian still needs to tone down the difficulty on lower difficulty levels and smooth the curve. You will likely hit problems in the low teens and then the endgame battles are stupid difficult. 4,. BUGS. Larian still can't test out bugs for‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• For instance, I finally won the final battle...only to have the game keep me in combat meaning I had to do the whole frickin' thing all over again. I finally got through it again and the voice-over proceeded to give me the wrong ending. DAMN IT LARIAN, YOU HAD ONE JOB!  Now on to the good stuff.  Like the first game, this game has the best turn-based combat ever to appear in a RPG. This is the meat of the game and it's sooooo tasty. There are many options on how to approach a battle, so many builds and so many tactics that it's impossible to even scrape the surface in a review. Literally no other RPG gives you this kind of build and combat flexibility.  Every encounter is a combat puzzle and most of them are fun. Sometimes an encounter seems impossible and then you figure out a strategy to make it relatively easy. This series remains the high-water mark of RPG combat and you could play it many times with many different builds because they play so differently. The AI is quite good to the point of being frustrating. You can - and will - get stun locked in certain battles (frustrating!). As I said, this is the core of the game.   The rest of the game is good too, even if it doesn't quite measure up to the combat excellence. The back stories of the starting characters are great and your party members seem to be far more developed this time. The voice acting has been consistently great and the music and sounds are still top-notch. The environments are quite beautiful and quite detailed though they are sometimes so busy the game delves into a pixel hunt. The races are really quite neat and there's a couple here that are fairly original which isn't easy to do in an RPG. The RPG aspects just feel more fully fleshed out in this version. The synergy between the NPCs doesn't seem to be very good to start but after a few rough bumps the first two levels it's easier to figure out how you want to blend your party. Truthfully, I haven't seen much in the Dev Cut that I didn't recall from the original but I'm sure there's some new stuff.  DoS2 is a step forward from the original and both are excellent games. Recommended for any RPG fan."

399,Rumbeef,"1,115",4,0,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,175.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game that had me constantly feeling as though I was getting to the point that I was powerful, and then they threw a curveball at me.  It kept me exploring and eating at the edges of quests that I would have to return to later when I was more experienced.  Throughout the game I came up to walls that I had to search for ways around or over, it seemed like the game was always ready for me.  It felt rewarding to figure out something, to get past an enemy who had stopped me before, to try something different with my skills and abilities.    I hadn‚Äôt played any Divinity games before and they had a good way of bringing me into the world they‚Äôve crafted, individual party members had interesting motives and I felt like our interactions were dependant on my input.  The story had a good thread pulling me towards the conclusion of the game and kept me wondering where it was taking me.    I like turn based combat because it usually feels like I‚Äôm responsible for what happens throughout combat, and Divinity has a few ways to have unexpected actions unravel your plans.  The elemental system worked well for this, combining a few different spells could make a whole area a minefield, or clear it by using alternatives.  I didn‚Äôt utilize all the systems, other than a few items I never had to touch crafting and rarely used potions.  The items and loot were enough to have an impact on my builds and I was usually able to get gear I wanted from either quests or vendors.  There are enough abilities and types of play that I could see a second or third run being very different than how I played through the first time.  I only played a little multiplayer, but I enjoyed how we were able to work together to rob and murder people, something I can never bring myself to do when I play solo.  I think they found a good balance around doing turn based rpg combat with multiple people, if one person gets into a fight while their buddy is somewhere else, the buddy can regroup and join into already active combat.  That also works in the single player game as well, I often would start a conversation with an enemy and before combat started I‚Äôd organize my squad and summon a demon for backup.   I got completely addicted to this game when I picked it up, I was impressed by it the whole way through."

There are secrets to be found everywhere, all of which give you loot, advance the plot, or reveal something about a character's backstory. The fight mechanics also depend heavily on the environment: element attacks have unique interactions with other elemental surfaces, height and positioning are hugely important in damage calculations, etc. You can choose any subset of characters you want, either custom or prebuilt (with backstory to discover as you play the game). I can't wait to play through the game again with a new set of characters and experience things in a different way, with new dialogue options, skills, builds, and alliances.

426,PacManPolarBear,396,4,0,"October 16, 2017",Recommended,142.7,"The realm of Rivellon feels vibrant and alive. At times sunny and cheerful, with delightfully lighthearted moments, but also deeply disturbing and dark, unafraid of having players face things that can only be described as nightmare fuel. One minute you are talking to a happy bear about honey and the next you are running for your life from a giant spider that wants to feed you to its babies. The balance between those two, the light and the dark, is spot on. The storylines are wonderful and interesting, with tons of variety. Side quests don‚Äôt feel like filler content which is a big plus for a game as large and full of things to do as Divinity: Original Sin 2 is.   It's one of the best looking isometric RPG‚Äôs ever made. Each of the games four major areas are exquisitely detailed and beautiful in their own unique way. Characters have subtle animations and visual flourishes that really make them stand out. The colour pallet is vibrant, gorgeous and bright with striking blue, green, red and yellow colours. The game does makes sure to contrast that with deep blacks, subtle grays and dark reds when fighting in the darker, more evil infested areas. Everything is visually interesting.  The soundtrack is wonderful. Joyous and fun one moment, tense and foreboding the next. None of the music feels repetitive or overstays its welcome. The sinister transition music that rings out when you enter truly dangerous areas still makes a shiver run up my spine every time I hear it. The fact that every line of dialogue in the game is voice acted is impressive and almost always of impeccable quality. It really helps sells the games more emotional moments.  The turn based combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2 is all about interconnected systems. Fire ignites poison clouds or oil slicks. Rain puts out fire while ice can trip up enemies and allies alike. Necromancy can raise the dead or curse the living but can be countered by healing magic. Everything has a counterpoint of some type and a well coordinated exchange can take advantage of any number of systems to powerful effect. Unlike D&D games where your characters live or die by a lucky or unlucky roll of the dice, Divinity: Original Sin 2 does not make players worship at the alter of the RNG (random number generation) gods quite so much.  The longer you play the more complex the combat interactions. By the time you reach the mid to late game the list of abilities and spells at your disposal is vast. Even though each character chooses a class at the beginning of the game you can place points into whatever skill trees and abilities you want. The game encourages experimentation and since you can respec as much as you want once you leave the games first area there is nothing to stop you from making a character that is exactly what you want it to be.  The early game leans a bit too heavily on basic elemental exchanges like fire and ice, but eventually you‚Äôll spend just as much time raising the dead, summoning demons, blinding your foes or charming people as you will tossing fireballs and ice shards. Because you have so many options when it comes to combat a lot of players have found ways to cheese the system. Some interactions were things the developers intended, but others are clearly breaking the game in ways they never considered. Patches post launch have addressed some of these issues, such as inflicting bleeding damage on an enemy and then transforming them into a chicken that runs itself to death. Or infinite damage loops that result from the interplay between buffs and attacks. That said the game encourages players to find innovative ways to tackle major obstacles. My personal favorite tactic it using teleport to push a tough enemy into the path of another powerful NPC and watch them tear each other to pieces.  Even with the ability to cheese the system at times and the plethora of options at your disposal, playing Divinity: Original Sin 2 on anything above Explorer difficulty can be really, really tough. Especially your first 10 hours with the game as you learn the intricacies of its many systems and options. The AI is smart and deadly and will throw every trick in the book at you. I restarted my campaign a half dozen times and invested almost 20 hours before I found a party composition and set of builds I felt complemented the way I wanted to play the game.  The game features a robust crafting system. Dozens of spells, potions, meals, enchantments and items can be crafted. You can learn recipes from books or experiment on your own to learn new ones. The one area where crafting falls short is weapons and armour.  Freedom and experimentation is at the very heart of what makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing. It applies not only to combat but how you tackle the games many quests and challenges. Almost everything has multiple avenues of approach and a myriad of solutions. The games main story quests give you a direction to aim yourself at but how you get there is completely up to you.  However this is also where Divinity: Original Sin 2‚Äòs biggest problem rears its head. The game is terrible at informing you if you are on the right track in completing certain quest lines and is often vague, to the point of maddening frustration, when it comes to giving you any sort of hint when it comes to what you should do next. On the one hand it is nice that the game does not hold your hand as if you were a child who never played an RPG before, but on the other it would be nice to know why a quest that seems to be over isn‚Äôt. Sometimes you are not sure if you just missed something or if the quest line is just bugged because you approached it in a way the developers never expected or tested for.  This issue becomes more apparent the further along you get in the game. Act 1 is relatively aggravation free when it comes following quest lines or encountering bugs. But by the end of Act 2 you‚Äôll likely pull your hair out over at least a few quests or nonsensical bugs. The game has been out a month now and I‚Äôm still locked out of a handful of quest the developers have acknowledged are broken because of the way I triggered them. I was able to get past the major bugs that were in my way but a bunch still remain. The very thing that makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing is the same thing that has caused issues with progressing further down quest lines or receiving rewards.  It‚Äôs by no means a game breaker and given the immense size of Divinity: Original Sin 2 and the sheer scope of what you can choose to do its amazing the game does not have more issues. The quest log definitely needs an overhaul and there are several major bugs that still need addressing but Larian Studios has already dropped a few hotfixes and one very large patch to address players concerns. Given the wonderful support Divinity: Original Sin 1 received I have no doubt that Divinity: Original Sin 2‚Äòs remaining blemishes will be ironed out before too long."

433,LMW-YBC,137,4,1,January 20,Recommended,126.8,"I bought this game knowing nothing about the franchise or of its background. My friends wanted to play it as it had co-op and looked pretty nice from the screenshots we had, so we all picked it up and gave it a go. 50 hours later, we eventually managed to finish our first playthrough, and what I came out with is one of the most enjoyable game experiences I have ever had, and without a shadow of a doubt my game of the year for 2017.  First of all, I did not expect the writing or voice-acting to be as good as it is. There is a lot of genuinely captivating moments the game has and a good amount of decisions you can make, either as an individual or as a party. You really do feel like you are on this grand adventure, and you essentially make your own story (even if you play as one of the origin characters) which is awesome.  Now, I think I need to get onto what is the most amazing part of this game: the gameplay. On the surface it seems quite simple, and it isn't exactly difficult as you have plenty of time to make decisions and your abilities clearly show what you can and cannot do in your current position. But if you take the time to experiment with things, you can discover new things that can entirely change the way you battle. Elements can combine to create strong new effects, objects and characters can be blessed to create entirely different effects based on their surroundings, combining abilities can create fantastic (and sometimes even hilarious) opportunities for your party, and so on. You are actively encouraged to try out new things, which is something I rarely see games do now.  The diversity of abilities is also a huge plus. There are a bunch of skill paths you can choose from, each having their own unique abilities. You can focus on having a bit of everything, or you can focus on a couple of paths, but whatever you do you will be able to make it work as with many paths you have a lot of capabilities to control the battle, and with less paths your abilities will be much stronger and capable of dealing a lot of damage. Finding a mix-and-match of what works for your team best is part of the fun, you can even change your stats entirely at a certain point so you can change if you feel your current ones aren't working.  I think it's no surprise, but the game is damn pretty. Even for a top-down game the level of detail in the world is astounding, and the art style really appeals to me. It never stays the same either, as you explore you will find new areas that have an entirely different look and feel to the last place, usually accomodated by new enemy types as well. I love the different races and how they look, as well as how differently they are represented in the game's society. It's an exceptionally well-made fantasy world that still manages to be believable.  Such a great game, if you are even remotely into RPGs I would say give this one a go. It's best played with friends for sure, although playing solo is fine, too."

436,AstroBoltos ‚ú¶,135,4,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,287.2,"One of the most immersive RPG's I have ever played, although it's only a part of Act I the world in Divinity feels ro rich in life and lore. Playing classic mode is just about right in terms of difficulty the turn based combat makes it super complex, it's both easy to understand but  hard to master. Combat is super tactical you will find yourself struggling to keep your party at bay fighting hordes of enemies. The enemy A.I. feels natural as if you where actually facing a big threat in the dungeons, but it balances out with how good you level up and build your party. There's a bunch of stuff you can do while in combat such as positioning and combining different elements to your advantage but it's still very fun and doesnt feel repetitive. The crafting gets a little confusing, dont know if it's because I haven't found many recipes but through combining you pretty much go blindly into it and expect to get soom goodies such as consumables and learn the recipe.  The decision making in this game is pretty much a big deal, since it signifcantly affects the people you interact with and the outcome of any conversation related to your actions or thoughts. For an early access game its 10 times better than any mediocre regurgitated unpolished garbage on steam.  The Core gameplay will be fighting and looting corpses to get stronger, but you will find yourself with a lot of quests from various NPC'S and sub-story lines. Although I felt a little insecure with how quests didnt show any markers on the map or minimap it is very immersive that while chatting with NPC'S they can pin point a location of interest in the quest if the person you're talking to actually knows about it, instead of just telling you to do something and you as a player just feel like you are going through rails while discovering quests.   The amount of time I spent reading and nitpicking through my journal and conversations was just about right, not too confusing but not too easy, the game really does a great job at treating you as a competent player. While its easy to get lost on objectives and questlines you can always go back to the conversations you've had with your journal. The Soundtrack is Amazing you wont even feel it bothering you when jogging or fighting through the maps various and diverse locations.   Overall I said everything I had to although, I had encountered various bugs but nothing a good checkpoint cant fix and I cannot wait for the full realease. A very good experience for a fan of the genre. I think most people should have a fun time, but its far better when playing with your friends and having a blast. Interactivity with the world and the attention to detail that Larian studios has made is superb, trully a nice gem to be found. I strongly recommend you get this game if you are into gaming in general."

Many places to explore, many people to persue and many 'ventures to subdue. One of the most epic experiences so far delivered in a fantasy world, giving us more control on builds to make - be anything you want! Combine your summoning skills with your tanking approaches, making yourself a strong opponent to those who dare to face you. Many quests to complete; each one of them has a good start and its up to you entirely how you would like the result to be. Turn based combat mechanics, along with some events that occur during the fight turn tides for both of sides, watch for a third invader! A bit of a rushed character development at the start, but you will get the gist of each easily the more you interact with them, all of them provide many benefits and great moments to witness your character engaging. Play with friends, play in-character during dialogues that can make the options wider in terms of gameplay and character benefits.   One of the best RPG games I have played in a long time that keeps me sunk in for hours even days now! coming from a guy doing a singleplayer, it is astonishingly entertaining, and the encounters are very memorable. Give it some love, look at what you'd like!"

A very hard game but once you are familiar with the mechanics of the game and spend time to level up a bit its managable.  Time will fly when you play this, be warned.  Still very fun even if you solo, can't comment on co-op. Game ran fine, no crashes even after 30 hrs.  Does support Ultra wide and graphics improved a touch over part 1.  Gears are  varied and shows great detail when equipped.  Good replayability as there are plenty of classes to choose from and you won't always get same results as your previous playthrough.

447,spookwhisper,506,4,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,56.1,"This game is -inarguably- niche. It comes out like a classic CRPG right to the core, an extremely well made translation of pen and paper gaming to a cigital medium. If you like pen and paper games, both RPG and skirmish style games included, you'll love this game. If you like squad-based strategy like Xcom, you'll love this game.  Along with its very robust take on traditional RPGs the game offers quite a diverse list of skills and assets right off the bat before we even have been given access to its modding API.  That being said, the game's primary strength is its greatest weakness, at least in respect to the main campaign mode of the game. It's an RPG unfettered by the tropes and clear story path of modernity. Even frequent PnP gamers are going to be left scratching their head for a while out of the gates. You can and will fail quests inexplicably, get left behind by NPCs if you go to loot more when they are proceeding to something else, and the slightest mis-step can irreversably change your playthrough. For example in one of the earliest dungeons, you can step through an unlabelled door hoping its an exit or a way to proceed only to find out it leads right into the courtyard of the fort you were infiltrating. A moment later you realize this turns many NPCs hostile, some of which are very powerful at that level and patrol the starting town.  If the game is such a throwback to classic RPGs, why isn't there some kind of dungeon master feedback to when you're about to accidentally do something very dumb?  -----  Act 1 Update:  Now on the final fight of Act 1, I'm still not thrilled with game's main campaign. Its main problems are the pacing, lack of dungeon master feedback, and chaotic difficulty curve. It's very stop and start with the pacing, letting you calmly explore at leisure before randomly throwing in URGENCY with no prior DM feedback. You cross a line and scripts trigger with very little nuance. There is little to guide you through the zone to meet each encounter at an appropriate level on top of that, so expect to spend your first few hours save scumming around to find just the right order in which to defeat every encounter to come out powerful enough to defeat the act boss.  -----  Acts 2-4 Update:  Once you've finally managed to use a cheesy enough set of tactics to get through the final 2 fights of Act 1 it's all smooth sailing from there. HAHA. Nah that's a lie. You can still accidentally skip crucial plot points, fail to recieve plot crucial powers, and have literally nothing to guide you accept the need for more EXP. Unless you by chance end up on the developers' intended story path you not only can become completely lost and unable to progress... You can completely break the progression! You can end up in Act 4 without powers you were supposed to obtain in Act 2 that are critical to gameplay and progression. You can end up doing everything needed for the story along one path, but the game won't recognize it because you didn't do things in the exact order the game wanted.  The main campaign of this game is a flowchart of chaos and bad scripting. It's got Tommy Wiseau's ""The Room"" levels of WHAT IS EVEN GOING ON without the unearthly charisma of Tommy's complete mania.  Do not buy this game for its main story alone. It's 30+ hours of potentially wasted time. If your game offers that many hours of content, there shouldn't be conditions in which you have to completely restart it because you missed something at hour 4 you need for hour 26.  ----  Game Master Module  Always save the best for last. That is something that I should not have done with this game. I almost would not reccomend this game if not for the raw potential it had with the Game Master module. Not only does it allow you to make your own custom campaigns to upload for everybody, you are able to play as the invisible hand of god with your friends and build a campaign as you go. It's a PnP gamer's dream game.  It does have its flaws though. The GM mode's sucess is going to hinge very heavily on support from a modding community to add more assets and maps to the system and potential future updates from Larian. It is almost barebones right now, and you sadly cannot build dungeons tile-by-tile. If you want completely custom maps you will need to learn how to make them with the modding API itself."
448,WTWR Zydrate,426,4,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,101.2,"This is one of those games I wasn‚Äôt really hyped for or interested in for a long time despite it haunting my wishlist for a while. At first it looked like a Diablo clone set in Divinity‚Äôs universe which would have been enough for me. Instead, it became more of an older school Baldur‚Äôs Gate/Icewind Dale type game with a bit of an XCOM flair to it. There‚Äôs many comparisons to be made but funnily enough, the game evokes the feeling of Morrowind and its general open endedness. It is a pleasant surprise.  Y‚Äôsee, in Morrowind, you could literally kill anyone. Even the self-proclaimed living god Vivec. You‚Äôd be met with a type of error message telling you to reload or ‚Äúcontinue in the doomed world you have created‚Äù. However DOS2 here actually doesn‚Äôt care who you kill, because progress can be found on journals, diaries, or keys on anyone‚Äôs body.  Character creation is a fun process. Not a lot on the physical customization because you mostly just play through a tiny avatar through most of the game, but the nuances come in the skillsets and ‚ÄúOrigin‚Äù characters. You can customize your own but the game comes with about five of their own, and mercifully you can customize their actual class so you can change the Enchantress‚Äôs build to suit your personal playstyle (mine being rogue/assassin like people) regardless of how she usually starts as a default NPC.  Choosing one of them may be to your benefit as they get extra dialogues and experiences. I chose Lohse, an entertainer/bard type girl who once met a dwarf she was familiar with and despite the grim surroundings, had a bit of a musical duet together for about fifteen seconds and it was quite a sight to see. You‚Äôd miss such an interaction if you went just for a personal custom character.  The game begins on a prison ship, and Act 1 is placed on the prison island altogether. I didn‚Äôt like the idea of being shackled for a while but the game does a great job of giving you plenty to do in what is essentially the game‚Äôs over extended tutorial. The amount of freedom I was able to acquire was staggering, even in the confines of the ship itself which is only the first twenty minutes of the game or so. In it, I could bash down doors, find a secret key for some extra loot, and even backtracked to murder a guard that was rude to me earlier, after‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•had hit the fan. It was awesome, and in that moment the game took me.  There‚Äôs a guy named ‚ÄúGriff‚Äù, the inmate who essentially ‚Äòcontrols‚Äô the other inmates, even going so far as protection rackets and food supplies (he runs the kitchen). There was a chestpiece called ‚ÄúGriff‚Äôs Shirt‚Äù on the ground, and he‚Äôs flanked by another vendor who occasionally patrols away.  On a hunch, I decided to sneak behind him when that happened and steal his shirt. It worked! The item‚Äôs blurb says ‚ÄúIt was Griff‚Äôs. Now it‚Äôs yours.‚Äù Then I saw the patrolling vendor run over yelling ‚ÄúThief! There‚Äôs a criminal about!‚Äù I just ran off, not wanting to test the game‚Äôs impressive AI to see if it could find me as the thief if I lingered in the area too long. I returned later, wearing his shirt and nobody was the wiser (which may in itself be a weaker point in the AI).  There will be some spoilers for Act 1, though my actions are hardly the only ones you can take.   To continue on the same line of how insane this game is with options, with the help of one of my online friends‚Ä¶ They led me to getting my collar removed, to which I was thrown into a dungeon for that. I don‚Äôt know how non-thieves get out of that but I was able to lockpick my way out, retrieve my gear, find a waypoint which allowed the transport of my teammates into the dungeon itself and we‚Ä¶ proceeded to absolutely demolish the guards from the inside out. We basically cleared the island. It was great.  There are so many nuances to the game that aren‚Äôt outwardly apparent. You may notice as you traverse the landscape that your characters will get a variety of buffs like ‚Äúwet‚Äù and ‚Äúwarm‚Äù which might turn to your detriment in combat when enemies cast spells to take advantage of those. The game is littered with oil spills, blood splatters, firey explosions and puddles. Each one can be affected by a spell type. One time, I had my mage set some enemies on fire but when it turned out to be to my detriment (my melee characters couldn‚Äôt reach some of the enemies), I had her cast ‚Äúrain‚Äù which didn‚Äôt just put the fires out, but actually creates a smoke screen which limited the enemies‚Äô vision.   So many enemies use a spell to summon a slick of oil then promptly set it on fire. They‚Äôre not idiots.  Combat in this game does an excellent job of making sure you‚Äôre both aware of your surroundings, and then actually capitalizing on it.  There‚Äôs more to it the nuances than your combat. I was speaking to a lizard-raced bodyguard in a cave who was very standoffish to my own character. On another hunch based on some of this guy‚Äôs dialog, I switched to a different party member and spoke with him again. I switched to Ifan, an ex-soldier. Being a soldier himself, the lizard-man actually respected Ifan more and had more dialog to give and even had an extra discount on the few wares he sold.  Most of my RPG life is spent in the perspective of my own, and it is a bit refreshing to see that exploring other personalities is typically rewarded here.  As I said, I‚Äôve only played through most of Act 1 so I do not have the full picture as far as the game will give me, but I am excited to find out, and more excited to the fact that there isn‚Äôt much I can get overtly wrong here.  If I had a complaint, it‚Äôd be the same complaint I have in many open world RPG‚Äôs. At a certain point my quest log gets bogged down by errands and scavenger hunts and it‚Äôs hard to tell which ones will be worth my time and what wouldn‚Äôt be. It‚Äôs also the one thing I feel I can actually get wrong - after having most of Act 1 down I still find myself with more than a few side quests, like finding a woman‚Äôs missing child and I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôll be missing out on any potential rewards if I just give up and move on in the story.  It‚Äôs a minor point to be sure considering the freedom the game is able to give you.  There‚Äôs so many other side stories I could give. Like how my multiplayer friend had the only pet pal perk, spoke to some dogs and then I ran back towards them and they all went hostile. Or how my dwarf teammate met up with an old friend and had a chuckle. Or what the pet pal perk even does, talking to dogs is just pure gold. Many other stories to be had and I can‚Äôt wait to hear others."

This game is the opposite of handholdy so when you use the mechanics to figure out a unique solution to a problem it is incredibly satisfying as nothing tells you to do certain things in certain ways.

I convinced my best friend to join me and we have been hacking away at anything and anyone who seemed like a bad guy. Breaking the game mechanics is legitamately half the fun here. We managed to sneak our way past Magisters by using the teleport spell. Somehow... we always managed to take the back door into every dungeon.   We couldn't stop getting ourselves in trouble at every turn. By the way, getting into trouble is just part of the fun. Speaking of which, be ready to quick save a ton. The developers were kind enough to give 5 quick save slots along with auto saves and unlimited hard saves... Unless you're playing on that insane 4th difficulty, in which you have just the 1 save and a total party kill is very very bad. You basically get your save erased on the hardest difficulty if everyone dies.   Pros: -Break the game dammit. Just do it! I swear finding ways to navigate and utterly cheese your way around a level is amazing. We saved a paladin just by teleporting everyone up to the second floor of the castle, then knock down the ladder, and then sneak to the front door... only to get prepared for a massive fight just before the doors swing open and  a Knight and Battle Mage just flat out turn into hulking battering rams that decimate the first guy they see. The amount of planning that you can make for a battle is amazing... I even got a chance to set up environmental hazards for the enemies by moving poison barrels and oil barrels ahead of a fight.   -The sneaking system is hilarious, but well maintained. Seeing a lizard tail poke out from under a barrel makes me giggle. The enemy vision scales down with higher thievery skills.  -The turn based fighting system is the best I have seen yet. It really feels like a ton of heart and effort has gone into this portion of the game. You need to see it to understand just how much it is like a legitamate DnD pen and paper style turn based system. It brings that niche genre to an immediate resurrection and breathes new life into it. Trust me, if you get this game for any reason, and you like turn based strategy, this is the very reason to get giddy like a damn school girl. The battle system alone is a game changer and was an insta buy for me and my friend.  -Choices, choices, choices. Choose wisely or shoot yourself in the foot... or shoot your friend in the foot... or shoot that annoying cat and feed it to the elf. I'm not joking, that cat is in the way all the time. I can't go 5 seconds without accidently lighting it on fire. The dialogue system is very well done and the choices you make will certainly matter. You can miss massive side quests that actually are very important to the overall story and your well being. Other mission and quests are just there to get your butt into a ton of trouble just because you said ""what's the worst that could happen?"". Everything... Just be careful with your choices. You may also live with any and every choice you make. Bad decisions can follow you and from the looks of it, can have consequences on the quests that get closed off because someone had a bad attitude with you or they got shanked unsuspectedly when you were looking the other direction. However, even bad decisions seem to lead down some interesting paths.   -Dialogue is absolutely amazing. Every character and NPC I have met so far is voiced and has a good feeling to their emotions. They always feel genuine, so far. I have yet to meet an NPC that had seemed overly annoying or out of place. The voice actors have done a really good job. My favorite part is the narrator, who has a soothing englishman's accent and doesn't feel snobby. Once again, props to the voice actors.  Neutral: -Have yet to experience the Game Master mode, yet the tutorial makes it out to be a true Dungeon Master style with 4 players under the control of the DM. You can make full campaigns and there are a literal sh*t ton of options. Just look up Game Master Tutorial on YouTube, which was made by the devs, and you'll see what I mean.  -If you don't pick one of the Main Characters, you may be missing out on massive parts of the story. Do not worry. If you create a custom character, you still have the option of taking 3 of the main characters along in your quests. Each main character has their own story and ambitions. Be sure to pay attention to them as they may lead you down some very interesting paths.  Cons: -I am legit am coming up short for things I do not like. There were some minor bugs when the game first released, but the devs seem to have a fast response time and are working diligently on most of the problems we were experiencing. In fact, most of the major issues disappeared on the first week. Sooooo... these are not the cons you are looking for..."

There are secrets to be found everywhere, all of which give you loot, advance the plot, or reveal something about a character's backstory. The fight mechanics also depend heavily on the environment: element attacks have unique interactions with other elemental surfaces, height and positioning are hugely important in damage calculations, etc. You can choose any subset of characters you want, either custom or prebuilt (with backstory to discover as you play the game). I can't wait to play through the game again with a new set of characters and experience things in a different way, with new dialogue options, skills, builds, and alliances.

481,PacManPolarBear,396,4,0,"October 16, 2017",Recommended,142.7,"The realm of Rivellon feels vibrant and alive. At times sunny and cheerful, with delightfully lighthearted moments, but also deeply disturbing and dark, unafraid of having players face things that can only be described as nightmare fuel. One minute you are talking to a happy bear about honey and the next you are running for your life from a giant spider that wants to feed you to its babies. The balance between those two, the light and the dark, is spot on. The storylines are wonderful and interesting, with tons of variety. Side quests don‚Äôt feel like filler content which is a big plus for a game as large and full of things to do as Divinity: Original Sin 2 is.   It's one of the best looking isometric RPG‚Äôs ever made. Each of the games four major areas are exquisitely detailed and beautiful in their own unique way. Characters have subtle animations and visual flourishes that really make them stand out. The colour pallet is vibrant, gorgeous and bright with striking blue, green, red and yellow colours. The game does makes sure to contrast that with deep blacks, subtle grays and dark reds when fighting in the darker, more evil infested areas. Everything is visually interesting.  The soundtrack is wonderful. Joyous and fun one moment, tense and foreboding the next. None of the music feels repetitive or overstays its welcome. The sinister transition music that rings out when you enter truly dangerous areas still makes a shiver run up my spine every time I hear it. The fact that every line of dialogue in the game is voice acted is impressive and almost always of impeccable quality. It really helps sells the games more emotional moments.  The turn based combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2 is all about interconnected systems. Fire ignites poison clouds or oil slicks. Rain puts out fire while ice can trip up enemies and allies alike. Necromancy can raise the dead or curse the living but can be countered by healing magic. Everything has a counterpoint of some type and a well coordinated exchange can take advantage of any number of systems to powerful effect. Unlike D&D games where your characters live or die by a lucky or unlucky roll of the dice, Divinity: Original Sin 2 does not make players worship at the alter of the RNG (random number generation) gods quite so much.  The longer you play the more complex the combat interactions. By the time you reach the mid to late game the list of abilities and spells at your disposal is vast. Even though each character chooses a class at the beginning of the game you can place points into whatever skill trees and abilities you want. The game encourages experimentation and since you can respec as much as you want once you leave the games first area there is nothing to stop you from making a character that is exactly what you want it to be.  The early game leans a bit too heavily on basic elemental exchanges like fire and ice, but eventually you‚Äôll spend just as much time raising the dead, summoning demons, blinding your foes or charming people as you will tossing fireballs and ice shards. Because you have so many options when it comes to combat a lot of players have found ways to cheese the system. Some interactions were things the developers intended, but others are clearly breaking the game in ways they never considered. Patches post launch have addressed some of these issues, such as inflicting bleeding damage on an enemy and then transforming them into a chicken that runs itself to death. Or infinite damage loops that result from the interplay between buffs and attacks. That said the game encourages players to find innovative ways to tackle major obstacles. My personal favorite tactic it using teleport to push a tough enemy into the path of another powerful NPC and watch them tear each other to pieces.  Even with the ability to cheese the system at times and the plethora of options at your disposal, playing Divinity: Original Sin 2 on anything above Explorer difficulty can be really, really tough. Especially your first 10 hours with the game as you learn the intricacies of its many systems and options. The AI is smart and deadly and will throw every trick in the book at you. I restarted my campaign a half dozen times and invested almost 20 hours before I found a party composition and set of builds I felt complemented the way I wanted to play the game.  The game features a robust crafting system. Dozens of spells, potions, meals, enchantments and items can be crafted. You can learn recipes from books or experiment on your own to learn new ones. The one area where crafting falls short is weapons and armour.  Freedom and experimentation is at the very heart of what makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing. It applies not only to combat but how you tackle the games many quests and challenges. Almost everything has multiple avenues of approach and a myriad of solutions. The games main story quests give you a direction to aim yourself at but how you get there is completely up to you.  However this is also where Divinity: Original Sin 2‚Äòs biggest problem rears its head. The game is terrible at informing you if you are on the right track in completing certain quest lines and is often vague, to the point of maddening frustration, when it comes to giving you any sort of hint when it comes to what you should do next. On the one hand it is nice that the game does not hold your hand as if you were a child who never played an RPG before, but on the other it would be nice to know why a quest that seems to be over isn‚Äôt. Sometimes you are not sure if you just missed something or if the quest line is just bugged because you approached it in a way the developers never expected or tested for.  This issue becomes more apparent the further along you get in the game. Act 1 is relatively aggravation free when it comes following quest lines or encountering bugs. But by the end of Act 2 you‚Äôll likely pull your hair out over at least a few quests or nonsensical bugs. The game has been out a month now and I‚Äôm still locked out of a handful of quest the developers have acknowledged are broken because of the way I triggered them. I was able to get past the major bugs that were in my way but a bunch still remain. The very thing that makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing is the same thing that has caused issues with progressing further down quest lines or receiving rewards.  It‚Äôs by no means a game breaker and given the immense size of Divinity: Original Sin 2 and the sheer scope of what you can choose to do its amazing the game does not have more issues. The quest log definitely needs an overhaul and there are several major bugs that still need addressing but Larian Studios has already dropped a few hotfixes and one very large patch to address players concerns. Given the wonderful support Divinity: Original Sin 1 received I have no doubt that Divinity: Original Sin 2‚Äòs remaining blemishes will be ironed out before too long."

501,Martyr81,83,39,1,"October 10, 2017",Not Recommended,106.1,"Upfront, I'll say this game does have some fun gameplay at times. However a litany of problems make me give this a negative review.  - Dumbfoundingly inconsisent difficulty. Battles range from entertainingly fun to stupendously, insultingly difficult. Seriously, you should never have to go into a battle knowing EXACTLY what is going to happen in order to have a chance of surviving (not winning, just surviving). And the only reason you know what's about to happen is because you've tried it half a dozen times and failed each time.  - Weak story compared to D:OS, and heavy use of sad, tired and predictable tropes. Half the time it wasn't even clear what we were trying to accomplish, and who/what we were fighting against or for. And when major plot points did occur, most of the time our response was ""Really? We're doing this again? Sigh...""  - For a game that encourages you to forge your own way, it punishes you for not following some pre-assumed path through the world. Heaven help you if you choose a different direction - enemies do not scale with level, and gear that would help you manage is prohibitively expensive. So if you head west when the game expects you to head east, you'll struggle.  - Battles that break the game's own pre-established rules. Examples: repeat casting of abilities which have multi-round cooldowns, and stacking identical status ailments. Case in point: The Sallow Man's Airborne Plague, which bypasses all armour (physical and magical), stacks with itself (I was at -15 Con at one point because of three repeat casts) and can be cast EVERY ROUND.  - Inconsistent lore/world impacts: you can kill someone and consume their soul, only for them to show up again later, apparently none the worse for wear. (Yay, that achieved a lot...).  - Multiplayer feels like two single player games occurring simultanously, with some quests not progressing or closing because the wrong player spoke to the quest giver. To add to that, if the speaker doesn't have the required item for a fetch quest, too bad - having it in the party isn't enough (but the game doesn't let you know that, does it? That would be too much to ask...)  - Quest system is broken. Somewhat repaired with a patch, but if you'd progressed past a certain point, the damage was done. The Tarquin side-quest was just a balls-up.  - My partner, who was using a controller (I use keyboard/mouse), had endless difficulty with target selection and interactions with the environment. Certain skills just wouldn't work (no reason was given - you just can't select this character because we say so). The controller interface also made line-of-sight hard to gauge, so several times critical actions were lost because of some unseen obstacle.  - Multi-stage boss battles: stop, just stop with this tired, over-used and just irritating chiche. This has been done so many times it's just not interesting, exciting or surprising.  - Some puzzles have an exact solution required, but the game gives you absolutely no guidance or hints. Another case in point: the Cursed Revenants in the Lizard Embassy. We gave up trying to solve that and just left them there. We got around them enough to finish the quest, but they'll be sitting there in the ruins till Judement Day.  More on the battle difficulty: if you're at the correct character level for a given encounter (ie a L5 party against L5 opponents) I don't think it's unreasonable that your party members are able to survive the opening salvo. I GM a Pathfinder group and so understand that some encounters are meant to be more challenging that others, depending on their importance in the plot progression. However, given that in 95% of encounters one or more of the opponents invariably go first, the number of times one (or more) of our party members were one-shot killed or disabled before they've had a chance to act is kinda ludicrous. This ties back into my previous point where you have to know exactly what is about to happen in order to have a chance of getting through the battle (which I consider meta-gaming in a cRPG). Sure, give the enemies superior starting positions and outnumber the party, but don't compount that by making every mook immediately superior to the whole party.  For a game that we've spent over 100 hours on, this has left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I can't say I've enjoyed it. We've given up trying to win the final battle, and to be honest I couldn't care less about how it ends. There were occasional moments of fun, but the negatives outweigh them."

509,DMD,17,5,0,"October 4, 2017",Recommended,399.7," 44 hours into the game, and we are just finishing act 1..  Few games gave me the same experience I'm having now with DOS2, and I don't mean the artistic, gameplay or story aspects of the game here, I'm talking about a personal feeling of satisfaction that as ""Gamers"" we are lucky to have a studio like Larian to develop such a marvel for us with such attention to details and passion for perfection, that you know from the start of the game you're going into a very special adventure.. The only game I remember that was able to deliver this personal experience and show the same level of love and dedication from its developer was the Witcher 3.  The Story (so far), the music, the voice acting, the graphics, and the world details, are all perfect.  The 6 origin characters, are very interesting to choose from and play as, each has her/his unique persona, story and quests.  Gameplay mechanics are hard but satisfying, it's a turned based tactical strategy with action points to spend each turn (xcom style), with a big number of varied abilities, skills and talents to learn, build, use and combo.  Quest tracking and inagme journal can be a bit confusing though, and might force you to miss some details on some quests, I don't consider that as a bad thing in principle, as it encourages you to keep checking the journal regularly, to find out and explore or even miss things on your own, but I would like to see some improvements on it in future patches.  The camera is inconvenient sometimes, it can be hard to spot enemies on higher grounds and the ones who are blocked or standing behind other characters.  It's hard to justify why some of the AOE skills are still affected by the miss chance, since most of them are still resisted by magical and physical armor anyway.  Now, one of the best parts about playing DOS2 for me is the co-op mode, that's why i mentioned ‚ÄúWe‚Äù at the beginning, I was lucky enough to have a friend who was interested in the game, and agreed to start the story with me, and since then we are having a blast, and enjoying the game together.  Playing in co-op provides you with a totally different experience, which adds to an already amazing game, I honestly think everyone should give it a try..  I mean: discussing the choices we have been offered in some conversation with a random rat, that we were able to speak to using one of our characters talent.. Asking my friend to use one of his character's flying skills to reach places my characters can't.. My friend asking me to buy him a skill book he found interesting, since I've invested some points in the barter ability which improve my trading skill, therefor I can buy items for cheaper prices than him..  Doing silly stuff that cause us to lose the fight like miss-clicking the wrong area, or healing my friend's rogue main character without noticing that she has the ‚ÄúDecay‚Äù debuff which damages her instead, laughing at our mistakes and then reload..  Those are some of the things that make co-op a great feature in the game, and all you need to enjoy it, is the in-game text chat, obviously you can use any type of communication, but i personally find the text chat better for maintaining immersion.  There are too many great games out there, but few of them can standout to be a masterpiece, DOS2 has its rare flaws sometimes but as a whole, it does ascend to its well deserved place as one of the best games of this generation, and this is one man's opinion.   Thank you for taking the time reading this.  "

542,Jobbut,198,8,0,"September 25, 2017",Not Recommended,137.0,"[Spoiler-Free Review] Foreword: The game is not reccomended for a few major reasons: 1. It lacks serious mechanical polish; if you played the first game, expect to be disappointed by many of the mechanics. 2. The game is seriously bugged, the majority of quests are very likely to break and become uncompletable-- Including the entire endgame sequence. 3. Acts 3, 4, and the endgame lack the content and polish of the first two acts, and were clearly rushed out the door.  Pros (Reasons to Purchase) +Combat is turn-based, tactical fun +Game has very acceptable voice acting, no particularly bad examples stand out +Art direction and visual design is top notch +OST, while not as good as D:OS1, is not bad with many fantastic tracks +World is vibrant and full of characters you can interact with +Game allows you a great degree of freedom in exploration and progression +Memory Slot system is much better than D:OS1's School system +Early game is very polished and expansive, lots of content and choice   Notables (Things You Might Want To Know_ =The writing is very hit-or-miss, but is excellent compared to AAA RPGs =Combat is very easy to those familiar with cRPGs and played the first game to completion; but is very challenging for those inexperienced with tactical combat or cRPGs. =Potential party members seem very abrasive and offputting early on before their stories develop =As of the time of writing, support for content creators is barebones but growing  Cons (Reasons to Think Twice) -Game's Quest Log system is broken, almost every quest in the game can and will break, have wrong entries in the journal, become unresolvable, or just outright disappear -Game's combat is significantly streamlined -The new Armor System was not properly fleshed out, leading to a lot of issues -Several mechanics are redundant, forgotten, or outright removed (Accuracy, Initiative, Attributes, etc) -Itemization, Crafting and the Economy are much worse than the previous game's -Character Building is very boring compared to D:OS1; there isn't nearly as many elements to work with, and lots of choices have been streamlined away -Lategame gets more and more restrictive and unpolished, things become a trainwreck by Act 4 -Devs are on a spree of nerfing/removing/restricting things in the game rather than fixing balance or overhauling anything; does not set a good trend for the game's continued development and community support  If you really want to buy it, or liked the first game, just do a bit of research about what changed and the game's current state before you end up in a 4 man coop party 49 hours later unable to complete the game, and half of you end up quitting or refunding before they bother to release the first major patch a month later.

Voiced dialogues with decriptive narration as if you are reading a book!   The combat is absolutely amazing especially for those of you that love using magic.  Whenever the player use a spell ie. Rain which will cause the area the leave puddles of water. The player can cast various spell on the water affected area for different status effect.  Casting aerotheurge skills on the water will cause electrocutions, casting poison will turn the water into pools of poison then use fire spells on the poison to release explosions!   There are so many ways of playing inside combat.  At first classic mode may be difficult for players that haven't got use to the game mechanics. One big tip is breaking enemies respective armor (physical/magic armor)  different enemies have different amount, some with lower physical and some with lower magical. Now then you'll have to carefully choose the right character to unleash damage on the enemy with physical or magical damage. Once the armor is broken you are free to put status effects on them to make them more vulnerable or simply crowd control them. Split your party before going in combat! And make uses of line of sight, make the enemy use ap on moving,   This game requires you to plan your strategy ahead, laying a spell and think of what that spell will affect for next few turn.   The world is stopping you from using your most powerful magic! But you hunger to unleash your full strength on to the world. Then this game is for you!"

561,Leonhast,414,3,0,"September 22, 2017",Recommended,23.2,"I've played lots of CRPGs. Baldurs Gate (both), Icewind Dale (both), Fallout (all of them), Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Planescape, Tides of Numenara, Tyranny, Wasteland, Pillars of Eternity, Divinity (all of them), Dragon Age (all of them, unfortunately) and more and more and more. This is one of the best of them. Great setting, different enough to be interesting, but not too strange ... you can identify with story and characters ... oh, yes, interesting characters, too. Combat makes great use of abilities and environment. It can be tough but that's part of the fun for me. I think also that it might have a lot of replayability because you can choose a number of different Origin characters who seem to get slightly different story arcs.  Story ... for my taste way better than Original Sin 1 (same goes for most quests). Can't wait to learn more.  Voice acting (Larian originally did not plan to do it) is a great addition and adds a lot to the game. I backed this game on Kickstarter, it was a no-brainer because Larian did great work with Original Sin 1 and is simply a great company, very much in touch with their fans and customers.  Great company, gem of a game and to top it of: an editor.

Game Master is a legitimate contender for Roll20 and like web sites for RPGs. They should try and copy what this game has done, but with more of a D&D rule system.    The bad:  If you like the PC doing the random save versus spells, you will not like the Magic and Physical armor combat.  This is not D&D rules.  Combat will always come down to keeping your armor up while trying to strip the enemies and using a bundle of crowd control to keep them from attacking you. I wish enemies scaled to your level. Example, if you fight hard enemies of superior level early, you will have a great challenge and might have to do multiple re-loads to win‚Ä¶BUT later you go to areas you missed or should have hit earlier and completely walk over the enemies who are of lower level.  The mix:  Once you understand the game mechanics and accept them, you begin to understand how to win battles against superior AI opponents through solid strategy.   The meh: The PC AI is hit or miss.  While there are times the AI does smart counters to your efforts, often it is the AI‚Äôs lack of intelligence that allows you to overcome those odds and cheapens the victory.   I can boast that I finished the game and will likely do multiple runs. Second, I have completed a lavish GM campaign that I will post in the workshop, so I have a complete understanding of the game.  Lastly, I‚Äôve been gaming since pong‚Ä¶need I say more?  Final thought:  If you want to experience everything this game has to offer, it would take multiple play throughs‚Ä¶some might see this as good, while others will see it as just too much an investment.

I'd definitely recommend hard difficulty for experienced tactical players. On the other hand, the story pulls you in. There are a lot of side quests, puzzles, and mysteries as well.    At the beginning were the predefined characters not that interesting to me, but with time they grew to my heart. And seriously, every single NPC dubbed? With branching conversations? That's every rpg player's dream come true. So be prepared to read a lot too. Or not, that's up to you.    Combat? Feels very fluent and very similar to a combat from the first game. But now some skills can be better combined and create a potential for your cunning. For example: with Hydrosophist and Necromancer you can make Raining Blood - which creates blood surfaces, sets bleeding on enemies and douses fire surfaces - and those blood surfaces you can further electrify or freeze, or simply walk on it with blood sucker for some healing.

The second game catapults that formula to the stars.  It stands alone as having the most freedom any RPG has ever given a player.

581,gerganon,31,3,0,"September 5, 2017",Recommended,474.6,"             This review will cover each aspect of the game and will be updated after full release: sound, gameplay, story, art etc.               Some things can only be understood if you actually experience them, so I won't go into much detail about those amazing things that make this game stand out from anything I have ever played.  The sounds, and music are part of this experience and I can't really describe how calming the sound of waves lapping on the beach is, or how tense the screams of a sadistic tortue chamber changes the atmosphere of the game.  Sound and music are excellent.  Full voice acting for all characters really encases you within the immersiveness of this world.                I've enjoyed 100 hours on the first Original Sin, and 150 hours on the Enhanced Edition, and the gameplay that made that game such a success has only been evolved and molded into a what can only be described as a masterpiece.                  I'll start with the simplest form of gameplay: Combat.  While simple in essence, the amount of possibilities and ways to approach every battle give the combat in this game replayability and makes it never feel monotonous.  You will find yourself planning turns ahead, baiting enemies into a tighter space, saving AP and waiting to spring a trap on them- just for your enemies to do the same to you.  Early access only has access to a ""medium"" difficulty, and as a veteran of the series I can say that while it isn't a walk in the park, it won't require too much out of a well thought out party.  Character planning and preparedness make the difficulty in my opinion, as starting battles differently will show you that a battle that you may have once thought very hard, can become very easy if starting it out thinking outside the box.  Picking up that oil barrel you saw way back, carrying and sneaking it into the middle of an enemy pack, sneaking out, and opening combat with that firescroll you have been saving since the beginning of the game is just one of the many ways you can make the game easier for yourself.                While the game rewards thinking in that aspect, one of my favourite things about this game so far is that it DOESN'T reward you traditionally.  A talent ""Pet-Pal"" will let you talk to animals, and you may expect that every animal you talk to should give you something in return, by nature of spending a hard-earned talent point on the ability.  While sometimes that may be the case, more-often than not you are rewarded with a thought-provoking sentiment from a creature that is just trying to survive in this crazy world.  Consoling and replacing an orphaned bear's parental figure, or trying to explain to a dog what death means won't give you EXP or skills, but will tweak your heart-strings and remind you that there is nothing you can't expect in this world that larian has created.                The story of this game is interesting, as it will be very different depending on who you are playing as, or who you are playing with.  6 Origin characters each have their own goals and will play the game according to their needs.  And even if you aren't playing as them, they will continue throughout the world trying to accomplish their unique goals.  And woe be to those that will stand in their way.  Will you help them or turn them against each other? Or pursuade them to join you?  Or use them to as a means to an end to find better treasure and kill them when their usefulness has run out?  The characters are vastly improved upon the first game and out of everything, this is the part of the game that is the most improved and the most exciting for fans of original sin.                The only thing I can reccommend to players both new and old is that you really try to do EVERYTHING.  If you think it may be possible, just try it out.  What does 10 points in telekenisis and a really heavy object look like over-top of the enemies head?  Sneaking Pacifist playthroughs?  A character that lights everything around them on fire, then has their fire spells reduced in cost because of them standing on fire, and having so much fire-resist that they are healed by standing in it?                  The replayability of this game is insane because there are too many viable options to discover and explore.  The best part about it all is that you can play with 3 other people and do it all together."

I'm not one for doing so, or for commenting in public in general. That in itself should tell you something about the sheer brilliance of this game.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is quite possibly one of the best games ever created, or at the very least one of the best RPGs ever made. Never before have I been so sucked in, so compelled by a game and its story, lore, and characters.  One of the first things you'll notice about DOS2 is the atmosphere. The musical cues, the environment, the feel of ever-present danger, a truly epic quest, and of course, the soundtrack. My god, the soundtrack.  Combat is innovative and feels really good. With an 'open-class' concept and enough spells and abilities, you can make just about any kind of character you could imagine. From a blood-sucking witch that dabbles in lightning to a sturdy warrior with a healing spell or two. And more notably, many of these spells can be combined with either others or the environment to create incredible effects. Toss a fireball into a pit of poison to make it explode into flames, or shock a pool of blood or water to possibly stun everyone caught within.  The game is hard at times, surely. Even on the easiest difficulty (which honestly can be -too- easy sometimes), you'll have to have to really think about the battlefield conditions. Honour mode especially gets mention; brutal, wonderfully intense combat mixed with your basic ironman mode. Wipe your whole party and its game over with a single save.  Finally, it's the story that truly shines in this game. I've played a -lot- of games in my day, but hands-down DOS2 is one of the single most powerful games I've played. The main story is sturdy enough to stand on its own and only gets better as you venture onward, and especially the last few hours will have you questioning everything. Your companions, who take the form of the other origins stories you don't pick at the start, have rich storylines each with a very nice twist. The voice acting is excellent, as is the narration, and the ability to romance one of your companions later in the story makes for a pleasant little plot point.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an incredible game, and you can tell Larian took their time to create a masterpiece. They succeeded. I can't see myself putting it down anytime soon. Fans of oldschool-esque RPGs with heavy emphasis on story, rejoice. Our savior has finally come."

I got into the early access and it felt very similar to the first, but more polished and the layout was more efficient.   The story is extremely in-depth, voice acting is exceptional with almost every npc having dialogue, a voice, and personality following suit.  The combat is great, targetting has been improved and what the reticle shows will happen is the actual result for the most part. Occasionally the abilities will miss, or you will accidentally move your character when you misclicked.   My only qualm is really the fact that I now have 6 friends who want to play with me, but we can't really get that together at once."

It's combat is turned based, but don't let that scare you away. It really does feel like a dynamic game of D&D.  The strategy that can go into each situation, whether you try to talk your way out or you just go full murder hobo, is really rewarding.  The games only in early access but it releases today. I can't wait to get my hands on the full title. The 11 hours I've played so far have been very enjoyable Every bit as good and in my opinion better than the original.   The addition of 100% voice over in the final game is just a big bonus for anyone who doesnt want to read a lot, although in this game its well worth the read or listen now. If you didnt play Divinity original sin, you missed out, but dont worry it really seems like it is not a prerequisite for the sequel.   There is definitely stuff in there that is remnants of the past game but the events of the game are 1000 years plus in the future from the original game.   I'm really hoping to get to put the game master mode to the test with friends somwhere down the line. The guys and gals at Larian really out did themselves. Talk about underpromising and over delivering. That was pretty much par for the course for this game, and boy am I glad they delivered.   I don't want to give the game a full rating yet, but I'm definitely throwing a positive thumbs way up for what i've played so far and from everything theyve shown us coming on release."

This game is excellent and so story rich it is hard not to get totally absorbed, There is really only one progression path it seems in the main quest set but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.   I suggest playing a charcter with an orgin story as they provide a more immersive experience, and intrestting dialogue options in some situations.

Absolutely nothing I've very played can top this game in its gravitas. The story is clever and riveting from the beginning to the end, and keeps the player rabidly invested in the development of both the characters and the state of the world. The story is supported masterfully by the (fully voice acted) dialogue, ambient music, and gorgeous art.   The combat in this game just... makes sense. Veterans of RPG games will have no trouble understanding the system, but even newcomers to the genre can pick it up in the space of a few battles. The game's combat continues to throw you curveballs in terms of player and enemy abilities, but they all fit snugly within the bounds of the overarching system. You'll feel like a strategist, unconsciously planning out the best ways to apply your characters' different abilities to best slay enemies with different armour types and quantities.  Divinity is an apt title for this franchise. The gameplay, story, and aesthetics are all worthy of that mantle. I could honestly see this game as a contender for best RPG of all time."

Huge amount of customization and deep combat system.  Keep in mind this game is 1) quite long 2) requires you to read, think, and sometimes retry things a different way, 3) takes a bit to warm up.

Adding in extra races, characters with origin stories that actually effect the story of the game, having a storyline that makes more sense then the last game and adding in romance options has really created an atmosphere that exeeds the previous game.  Adding in more spells (a new school has been added; Polymorph) and adding physical armour and magic armour instead of just health has really expanded on the combat.  The only con to this game is the quests and the way that they are explained/the player is directed. This was a problem in the previous game, where if you don't do the quest exactly as the game wants it, you won't complete it. As well as this, the game once again doesn't explain quests adequetly. Quests will have very vague references that leave the player running around entire maps not understanding what the next step is. This was a very big problem for me in the Driftwood area, where there were a lot of quests, but I was given literally nothing to give me a clue as where to go.  I'd still give the game a 9/10 regardless, because I liked this game very much, and still continue to play it. There's a lot more content here than the previous game."

That's insane, and really makes Larian one of most realiable and trusted names in video gaming. I can't heap enough praise on them, and this time multiplayer is simply astonishing.   + Darker than DOSI, with a much more compelling storyline and script + Unique take on character races. Elves eat flesh to reveal their secrets. Undead heal only with poison, and are engrossing to play.   + Combat system is one of the best, and the Ai is challenging, especially on tactician mode.   + Loot is balanced, and rewards the player depending on your choices.  + Beautiful game, and downright stunning at times. I find myself sitting idle just marveling at some of the game's foilage, and enviroments.  + It's optimized for lower end systems, and they are saying Mac support is likely as well. + RNG elements have been minimized with a tremendous loot system that makes each playthrough unique, but dependable.  + Highly custimizable skills and talents that truly allow you to make whatever you deem worthy of your time, and party composition.  + Multiplayer/Co-op are amazing, and even more enjoyable than the solo matches  + All Origin characters have depth, personalities, and stories that are woven into the fabric of the game. Events will trigger only for certain combinations, or interactions. It constantly surprises you. + Fully voice acted (80,000+ lines), and damn good too.  + The game is gigantic, and the tutorial island takes nearly 30+ hours to get through.   - Addictive, and you will want to stockpile food, and other goodies for your travels.     - The occasional glitch, but they are far and few, and easily overlooked by everything else"

There are only two things you need to know about Divinity: Original Sin 2.  First, within one week of launch it became the highest-rated games of all time on Metacritic (it currently has a metascore of 95).  Second, all of that critical acclaim is completely deserved.  You see, a very long time ago there was a game called Baldur's Gate 2. It was incredible. An enormous CRPG with engaging combat, compelling characters, and an intriguiing narrative. It demonstrated just how good a roleplaying game could be, and established a standard of quality that would cast a shadow over every subsequent CRPG for decades. For a very long time, we convinved ourselves that Baldur's Gate 2 was an outlier. An abberation. That we would never see another game of similar scope, scale or quality again. And that we were wrong to expect such grand ambitions from even our most beloved of developers.  But we were wrong.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is the game we have been waiting for. It is a spectacular, transcendental experience. Compex, challenging gameplay married to a well-written and extraordinarily dynamic narrative; gorgeous visuals and skilled voice acting; a phenomenal soundtrack and an overall design that grants players an unprecedented level of freedom.  But you know all of this already. Original Sin 2 has already thoroughly enmeshed itself into the zeitgeist. That metascore did not happen by accident, and you know it. The 10,000+ user reviews that are almost exclusively positive are likewise no accident.  This is it. The game that was promised. The game we never thought would come. Divinity Original Sin 2 is, finally, the true successor to Baldur's gate, not because it has a similar style of gameplay, or a similar tone or narrative style, but because of what it represents: a new standard for the genre.  Truly, it is one CRPG fit to rule them all."

I paid full price for this one, and I am very pleased with the purchase.  The application of turn-based combat mechanics to old-school RPG gameplay makes Divinity a very worthwhile experience. It's like Neverwinter Nights had a beautiful lovechild with Xcom. It's also a huge game with huge number of ways to play, and I particularly like that you can play it local-coop. My wife and I are always in the market for a good couch-coop game, and this one is spectacular.  My only complaint with the gameplay is that there is a LOT of inventory management required, at least if you want to i. have adequate gold and ii. don't want your inventory to look like a crazy bag lady got a hold of it. I've also found the game to be pretty buggy at times, though it's only actually crashed once in more than a hundred hours of gameplay."

638,Teteh,240,3,0,August 30,Recommended,253.6,"Definetely one of the best rpg I ever played and one of my favorite game of all time.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a very refined rpg with a decent 30-ish hours of content without taking into account the amazing replayability (Thanks to the origin character having varying stories and the game having a branching scenario.)  The combat system is close to perfect, the bossfights can be very challenging, the voice acting is great, everything is very pretty and each mechanic is really interesting and in-depth.   The only way I can describe how great this game is is not by stating the endless list of things it does perfectly, but by listing the only few things it could do better: -A few glitches getting you stuck in dialogues when playing coop -Half of the ending cutscene not playing for players who choosed to fight for Divinity and lost -Easy to overlevel and trivialize the game until the last few bosses  And trust me I had to dig deep into my brain to find you that handful of flaws because this game is truly close to perfect. I'm the first person to always find the tiniest detail to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about in every single game I play (My friends hates me) but Divinity: Original Sin II is the first game I sunk 8 hours in and surprised myself I didn't get stupidly angry at anything!  I'm 250 hours in and I only cleared the story once, I still want to know the side story of Fane and Lohse, I still have quests I forgot to do, and so on! This game is not only great, but it's full of content that will make sure your money spent on its heavy price tag is worth it!  I should also mention that the game have a Gamemaster mode that allow you to design and play typical Dungeon and Dragon campaign with your friends online, without the hassle of collecting tons of paper and friends around a table and with the ease of using digital scenery that will nearly always look better than that papier-m√¢ch√© montian you spent 5 hours on!   Overall I believe this game is a must have and even while its price tag is a bit scary, after playing it a bit I knew it was worth the money I spent on it!  Really great game, if you like rpgs and especially if you have friends to play with, don't hesitate, this is probably the best rpg of this decade."

650,zanos,300,3,0,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,102.0,"Wow, where do I begin...  This game harkens back to a time long past, a time of unforgiving games that don't hold your hand,  and offers you pithy clues to make your way through a vast uncompromising land replete with challenging combat, the odd puzzle, and a myriad of ways to deal with a situation rather than selecting an option through a chat box.   There were so many instances during my playthrough where I felt like I was breaking quests only to see them to completion in ways that would have involved a reload in others.  It's a game that stands on some firm philosophical foundations: questioning the nature of power, the idea of power corrupting or the good that can be done if consolidated. It explores the nature of institutions in a world gone awry, exemplifying the idea that the road to hell is most certainly paved with good intentions. The moral dilemmas are many, and in an almost Witcheresque fashion, the consequences of actions taken often come with a cost.  That being said, Larian is able to balance the seriousness of the subject with the humor, sarcasm, and satire that they are known for and given the gravity of the events unfolding, the humor adds an extra dimension to the game.  The combat is as challenging as you want it to be. I don't mean in terms of a difficulty slider, I mean in terms of scouring the forums for optimal builds or cheesing for gold to get the best possible equipment. I don't condemn either, I found it rather refreshing that the satisfaction of combat is as customizable as you want it to be depending on how one chooses to engage in a situation. Do you use environmental barrels? Reposition before engaging the situation? Run in and make do? Some of these will work, others will not, but what is interesting is that the solutions to these situations are many and are at the discretion of the player.  The companions you can choose all have excellent backgrounds, some more interesting than others, but all of them were noteworthy. What is also interesting about it is that they are not just there for you, like in most RPGs, they have their own ambitions, goals, and desires and often time going at odds with them could cost you a slot on your roster.   The quests and the world itself are amazing, especially the latter. It's not perfect, and you can clearly see some additional attention was given to certain areas of the game over others, but the different areas, the choices made, and consequences really strengthen the overall story and your journey from a prisoner in Fort Joy to its aftermath.   The quests, in typical Larian fashion, run the gamut. They vary from discovering a serial killer to the occasional rescue to providing an item or eliminating a threat. They are pretty standard fare, but what is interesting is how many different ways you can handle them and the consequences of handling them in the way that you do. There have been bugs with journal entries, and sometimes quests can seem rather baffling, but I didn't really let that upset me. I have no doubt that in the coming months they will be fixed and tightened up. But yeah, to some, and to me at times, it was frustrating.  All in all, this was an excellent game. Perhaps that isn't the right word, it was better than excellent. It was not without its faults, but I really got a lot out of it, from the story, to the challenging combat, the voice acting, the perks and quirks of communing with animals, the different ways to tackle each situation and even the soundtrack. It's a tightly knit rich and rewarding game that you savor long after it ends and even into the beginning of the next playthrough.    If you like CRPGs, you will most likely really see this as a worthy successor to the Fallout 2 style of CRPGs. People have been comparing it to Baldur's Gate 2, and, in terms of the story, companions, and the epic nature of the experience, you can definitely draw comparisons, but the combat is firmly rooted in the Fallout 2 or Temple of Elemental Evil tradition.  So, yeah, Larian does it again, even better than before. I expected a good game, even a great game, but I was not expecting this. It will be penned into the great book of RPG goodness that it deserves. Larian firmly deserves every bit of success they get from this title.   They have stolen the divinity from the former greats and it is perhaps only contested for the crown, in my opinion, by CDPR. Obsidian is also up there, but POE, even in all of its greatness, failed to evoke the same feelings that I had for this. It really filled the void left for me by the Witcher 3, and for those of you that know what I'm talking about and perhaps for those of you reading these reviews to see if it's a worthwhile purchase...it is.  Good luck in your future endeavors Larian, I, for one, will be there to continue to back your projects henceforth, bien fait."

Adding in extra races, characters with origin stories that actually effect the story of the game, having a storyline that makes more sense then the last game and adding in romance options has really created an atmosphere that exeeds the previous game.  Adding in more spells (a new school has been added; Polymorph) and adding physical armour and magic armour instead of just health has really expanded on the combat.  The only con to this game is the quests and the way that they are explained/the player is directed. This was a problem in the previous game, where if you don't do the quest exactly as the game wants it, you won't complete it. As well as this, the game once again doesn't explain quests adequetly. Quests will have very vague references that leave the player running around entire maps not understanding what the next step is. This was a very big problem for me in the Driftwood area, where there were a lot of quests, but I was given literally nothing to give me a clue as where to go.  I'd still give the game a 9/10 regardless, because I liked this game very much, and still continue to play it. There's a lot more content here than the previous game."

It's a masterpiece at every level, and even had a surprise at release with over 80,000 lines fully voice acted. That's insane, and really makes Larian one of most realiable and trusted names in video gaming. I can't heap enough praise on them, and this time multiplayer is simply astonishing.   + Darker than DOSI, with a much more compelling storyline and script + Unique take on character races. Elves eat flesh to reveal their secrets. Undead heal only with poison, and are engrossing to play.   + Combat system is one of the best, and the Ai is challenging, especially on tactician mode.   + Loot is balanced, and rewards the player depending on your choices.  + Beautiful game, and downright stunning at times. I find myself sitting idle just marveling at some of the game's foilage, and enviroments.  + It's optimized for lower end systems, and they are saying Mac support is likely as well. + RNG elements have been minimized with a tremendous loot system that makes each playthrough unique, but dependable.  + Highly custimizable skills and talents that truly allow you to make whatever you deem worthy of your time, and party composition.  + Multiplayer/Co-op are amazing, and even more enjoyable than the solo matches  + All Origin characters have depth, personalities, and stories that are woven into the fabric of the game. Events will trigger only for certain combinations, or interactions. It constantly surprises you. + Fully voice acted (80,000+ lines), and damn good too.  + The game is gigantic, and the tutorial island takes nearly 30+ hours to get through.   - Addictive, and you will want to stockpile food, and other goodies for your travels.     - The occasional glitch, but they are far and few, and easily overlooked by everything else"

In the years that followed, theys left behind the dice and paper, moving into the realsm of digital wizardry, and in time they did beget the CRPG.  And it was good. A myriad of beardy, stats heavy mana did fall from heaven, and the faithful feasted on Baldurs Gates, Eyes of the Beholders, Neverwinters, Fallouts and Arx Fatalises.    A great time it was, indeed.  A time when quests could be solved by using your brain rather than murdering everything in sight.  A time when putting points into speech resulted in more than just a boost to bartering. A time when you could convince an endgame boss to kill himself if your stats would allow it.  Alas, a time of great darkness followed, and hither came the likes of Dragon Age 2 and Fallout 4, from whence there was little 'role-playing' and simply 'game' in its stead.  Bethesda and Bioware did cheer as they drowned in coin, but the 'R in the 'RPG' was thought lost forever, and the faithful seemed eternally doomed to walk the path of 'action adventures with skills trees but really you just have to murder everything',   'You don't need any of that old beardy old RPG nonsense' Dragin Age Inquisition cried.  'You need bland worlds of endless icons and fetch-questing between awkward digital sex scenes with elven waifus.  You won't have time for meaningful dialogue choices or stats that effect anything other than combat, not when there are farmers who need you to find lost sheep or villagers who need you to go into the forest and bring back10 rumpleberry leaves'.  All was thought lost...   But hark!  the Bespeckled Ones did hear thine prayer!  'A skill-tree doth not an RPG maketh!' cried Larian, and Divinity Original Sin did emerge from the darkenss, and it was good.  It was bloody good. It giveth from the fruits of meaningful dialogue, choices and actions with consequences, stats and character building that actually matter the game, and it blessed with the freedom to solve problems and quests in any way you could figure out.  And in the later years, Larian did beget Divinity Original Sin 2, and it was even better than the first in almost every way imaginable.  More complex, more engaging, more consequential to the players actions, better written, more co opy then before, just more in everyway!  And the faithful did rejoice! Multiple playthroughs were planned, and marriges and careers thrown to the wayside!  It was the RPG we all wanted...  The Bespeckled Ones have not forsaken us.   (FYI this is just a bit of a laugh.

I¬¥ve played about 100h now and had alot of fun building weird character combinations , playing alone and with friends. There¬¥s a few minor things that bug me but they can all be fixed with mods. All in all my money was well spend on this game and cant wait for either a dlc or a addon campaign! Would spend again !"

This game shines where other games just brushes over. From the writing of dialogue to the extreme open endings of each story. Even just looking around will have you waste hours thanks to breathtaking environment.   Where there is good there must be bad. The bad thing about this game is the closer you get to the ending the more you want to start over. Nobody wants this game to end.  In the wake of companies disregarding single player games, DOS2 deserves the be the flame carrier for those experiences.   "

There are only two things you need to know about Divinity: Original Sin 2.  First, within one week of launch it became the highest-rated games of all time on Metacritic (it currently has a metascore of 95).  Second, all of that critical acclaim is completely deserved.  You see, a very long time ago there was a game called Baldur's Gate 2. It was incredible. An enormous CRPG with engaging combat, compelling characters, and an intriguiing narrative. It demonstrated just how good a roleplaying game could be, and established a standard of quality that would cast a shadow over every subsequent CRPG for decades. For a very long time, we convinved ourselves that Baldur's Gate 2 was an outlier. An abberation. That we would never see another game of similar scope, scale or quality again. And that we were wrong to expect such grand ambitions from even our most beloved of developers.  But we were wrong.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is the game we have been waiting for. It is a spectacular, transcendental experience. Compex, challenging gameplay married to a well-written and extraordinarily dynamic narrative; gorgeous visuals and skilled voice acting; a phenomenal soundtrack and an overall design that grants players an unprecedented level of freedom.  But you know all of this already. Original Sin 2 has already thoroughly enmeshed itself into the zeitgeist. That metascore did not happen by accident, and you know it. The 10,000+ user reviews that are almost exclusively positive are likewise no accident.  This is it. The game that was promised. The game we never thought would come. Divinity Original Sin 2 is, finally, the true successor to Baldur's gate, not because it has a similar style of gameplay, or a similar tone or narrative style, but because of what it represents: a new standard for the genre.  Truly, it is one CRPG fit to rule them all."
681,Discos and Dragons,425,3,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,233.1,"This is a really good RPG that is constantly receiving balance and bug fixes, while listening to it's community.  Pros: ++ NPCs REACT to things and I can't describe how essential this is for a good RPG; the tag system, your class and race choice, talents and attributes, quest choices, etc, make the NPCs say different things each time, it doesn't even matter if they don't lead to major changes about half of the time, the fact that they exist puts this game a little over most other RPGs. ++ Constantly improving. ++ Can do an almost infinite combination of skills and classes, and pretty much all of them work. ++ Multiple ways to complete almost every single quest in the game. ++ Very good completionist game, requires no multiplayer and all achievements are related to single unique tasks or milestones, (needs more than one playthrough for 100% completion and needs at least one of those to be on honour mode). + Varied equipment and multiple armor sets. + Big open areas with epic fights that can lead to awesome adrenaline filled moments. + Rewards exploration, replaying the game, and learning the mechanics. + Can be played alone or with friends. + Larian Studios is one of the best developers out there, they published continuous game updates through the development process.  Cons (Keep in mind that most of these things mostly apply for Tactician or Honour mode): - - Tactician and Honour mode not only need vast knowledge of the game, but also luck and a strong focus on one source of damage. - - Requires one single Persuasion focused character and discourages you from using two of them since you can't use other characters to intervene during conversations using their own attributes for persuasion checks (like you can in Wasteland 2 for example), which makes the speaker feel like a lone adventurer everytime you're not in battle. - - As of March 2018, NPCs are doing weird things on tactician and honour, for example, making ice surfaces, then casting fire on them to make steam and water, then turning the surface back to ice; casting Death Wish on opponents and not using certain gap closing skills unless damage can be dealt right after. - Some skills feel really weak considering they cost the same points as others. - You may or may not like the armour system, I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me over time. - A certain talent (Lone Wolf) makes the game EXTREMELY easy, except for the starting area, when you don't have decent gear. - Easy to fall into minmaxing on these difficulties, since in reality, there isn't any other choice to beat them reliably."

Your enemies will be very tough encounters but every encounter teaches you how to use your parties skills and the terrain to your advantage and you eventually start to win.

I have spent (probably too many) hours on building a brand new character and running through a good portion on Fort Joy. The whole storyline is a amazing and the interactions between party members is on point.

703,Skankinpig,59,3,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,36.7,"I'll start by saying i've not played all that far through the story - I've had multiple starts due to purchasing just prior to release and a Co-op partner who seems to enjoy playing several classes before sticking to one.   Interestingly enough, this has had the positive of showing me just how different the game can be with different class combinations. We've played combos where it seems that no matter how careful we are, the battlefield inevitably becomes a blanket of different elemental affects indiscriminately maiming everybody on it and we've had more tactical groups that have more control over such affects, without the volatile power behind their attacks.   We've settled on a slightly more understated group, methodically using status affects to control the flow of battle and tip it into our favour.   The game is beautiful looking, it's as deep as you wish it to be and the sheer amount of detail in the world is amazing. The UI is simple without being restrictive, the game will guide you without holding your hand and through that allows you to make your mistakes, or genius discoveries and whichever it be, you're left with under no illusion: That was your doing, for better or worse.   I always want to like games like this but often find the world doesn't feel alive enough, is to linear or awkwardly open to its own detriment - the balance is never quite right, but here, for me at least it has been struck and i've really enjoyed exploring and experimenting.   tldr:   The game is generally well polished, fun and of good depth. Looks beautiful, with an interesting story and the world feels richer for it. Worth a buy from any RPG fan, especially if like me, an rpg feeling like an MMO with no players in it just feels like an empty experience to you - you wont find that here."

I like it so much, I bought the original Divinity just to give me something to play pending complete game release in September.  Thanks so much Larian Studios.  This is one of the very best Steam purchases I've ever made.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  :)  Update 9/17/2017:  Now that game has been officially released, let me add that the voice acting on finished game is great.

It has taken me 145 hours to complete Divinity Original Sin 2 and I just want to say that it was one of the best CRPG experiences that I have had since I finished Planescape Torment (for the first time) back in 2013.   Now onto the  Pro and Cons followed by my final thoughts.  Pro:   - Interesting story & interesting party members with choice & consequences - Amazing soundtrack - Great replayability (multiple endings, different classes & origins to pursue) - All dialogue is fully voiced (major props to Larian for taking the huge undertaking on fully voicing every line of dialogue in the game) - Robust crafting system - Interactive open world gameplay (picking up objects and moving them around to your advantage or to plan strategies) - Robust character & class customization with the option of respeccing  Cons:  - Optimization issues mainly in the second half of the game/later acts (solved via patches) - Some bugged quests that don't complete properly or don't trigger (solved via patches) - No search item bar option in the inventory for specific items (quality of life improvement)   Conclusion: The sheer amount of content and replayability that you get from this game is staggering and I cannot fathom how Larian have managed to create such an amazing game in such a short span of time (2 years).   I would like to thank Larian and everyone involved including the Kickstarter backers help create this masterpiece. The praise it has received from numerous gaming outlets is well deserved.  Now...do I recommend this game? This is one of those games that shouldn't be missed, because it's one of the best CRPG's ever created and if you have any incling of trying a turn based RPG then I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this game is worth your money."

The atmosphere of the game is somewhat dark, but humorous at times with a sprinkle of childlike light themes. Has lovable, charming, but yet believable characters. The combat and all questing is never boring.  The game has been a real sense of accomplishment playing through it, it's so much fun to play with friends, so I'd really recommend this as a co-op game. However, playing solo is also very fun. All other games since I bought D:OS 2 have been outclassed by it in sense of enjoyment for me.  Not a short game either with all the mod capabilities, and I've played about halfway through the story in about 122 hours and I've still so much more to explore in the game.  Would really recommend - best RPG experience I've had."
711,Rhedin,154,3,0,April 25,Recommended,87.1,"I absolutely recommend this game.  It plays like a classic RPG with turn based combat, action economy, skills, spells, multiple ways to build your characters, even multi classing and having it have drop in drop out 4 player cooperative is a very nice feature, can even be modded to have larger parties though you will unbalance the game for yourself and disable achievements. The in game lore and stories play well from one arc to the next and the scenes in which they are set are beautiful.  My only complaints about this game would be the lack of interesting none human player races, though the lizard folk are really nicely designed.  The fact you can move far enough away from active combat (sometimes) to leave combat and thus get infinite and free action economy whilst the rest of your team is playing turn by turn."

I didn't check for a week but after some more time I took a look. 10 minutes after first checking out the game I bought it and here I am, almost 100 hours in the game.  The game is huge, we played the first act for 20+ hours, and there are 4 acts! The gameplay is very interactive and feels great, you can, for example, create a puddle of acid and set it ablaze!  EVERYTHING is voice acted and the graphics look beautiful. Also the combat system is great for players that like tactical games. Your positioning and skill usage matter a lot, 1 wrong move might cause the end of you.  There's also a ton of replay value due to all the different classes, origin stories and decisions that you make. On top of that there's the Game Master mode where you can create your own campaign or play the ones from others aswell as the workshop which already has a ton of stuff on it.  The only 2 things that I dislike so far is the fact that a few quests have a tendency to bug out making you unable to complete the quest. Also the mages in this game are kinda underwhelming. Physical characters are much more potent. Im hoping they'll take a look into that.  All in all a great game and possibly one of the best rpgs ive played so far.

In the years that followed, theys left behind the dice and paper, moving into the realsm of digital wizardry, and in time they did beget the CRPG.  And it was good. A myriad of beardy, stats heavy mana did fall from heaven, and the faithful feasted on Baldurs Gates, Eyes of the Beholders, Neverwinters, Fallouts and Arx Fatalises.    A great time it was, indeed.  A time when quests could be solved by using your brain rather than murdering everything in sight.  A time when putting points into speech resulted in more than just a boost to bartering. A time when you could convince an endgame boss to kill himself if your stats would allow it.  Alas, a time of great darkness followed, and hither came the likes of Dragon Age 2 and Fallout 4, from whence there was little 'role-playing' and simply 'game' in its stead.  Bethesda and Bioware did cheer as they drowned in coin, but the 'R in the 'RPG' was thought lost forever, and the faithful seemed eternally doomed to walk the path of 'action adventures with skills trees but really you just have to murder everything',   'You don't need any of that old beardy old RPG nonsense' Dragin Age Inquisition cried.  'You need bland worlds of endless icons and fetch-questing between awkward digital sex scenes with elven waifus.  You won't have time for meaningful dialogue choices or stats that effect anything other than combat, not when there are farmers who need you to find lost sheep or villagers who need you to go into the forest and bring back10 rumpleberry leaves'.  All was thought lost...   But hark!  the Bespeckled Ones did hear thine prayer!  'A skill-tree doth not an RPG maketh!' cried Larian, and Divinity Original Sin did emerge from the darkenss, and it was good.  It was bloody good. It giveth from the fruits of meaningful dialogue, choices and actions with consequences, stats and character building that actually matter the game, and it blessed with the freedom to solve problems and quests in any way you could figure out.  And in the later years, Larian did beget Divinity Original Sin 2, and it was even better than the first in almost every way imaginable.

If you want to play lonewolf, you will without a doubt lose and have a disadvantage later in the game from fighting events that are designed for losing turns..... THATS the problem needing to be addressed... WHY are there so many freaking lost turns in this game. Stunned makes sense, Feared, is okay. Why is knocked down the same as stunned.

760,RT-XD,296,3,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,144.4,"I've been holding out on writing a review for this game until I finished it, which took ages because I put the difficulty to tactician mode which made things extremely difficult!! (But very fun!) I put 144H to finish one playthrough.  The best way I can put it is: it's probably the best game I've ever played since Witcher 3.  I backed this game after playing the first Original Sin, which left me wanting to play even more! I definitely made the right decision. There's a lot of freedom in this game; playing with friends, playing alone and even doing our own DM games. I only played it in Single player mode so far, but I'm very much looking forward to playing with friends when they get the game. Here's a general pros and cons list (from a single player perspective):  + Graphics are great + Runs really well + Gameplay is fantastic (if you like turn-based games) + You can pretty much do anything and kill anyone you want + Voice acting is phenominal + Companions each have their own backgrounds which tie in with the main story line, really giving you a sense of wonder and motivation to find out what's going on and how to 'fix' it. + Workshop and Modding (read below for more)  - There were a few issues with quests not finishing properly, or not being able to talk properly to some NPCs, leading to missed XP and story (but a lot of that got fixed recently) - Tactician mode is difficult. Really makes you work hard to find as much XP before moving onto other parts. Especially at the beginning of the game.  Now here's the BEST part of all this: Larian even gave us the Divinity Engine 2 to us for making our own Campains and DM games. Which means...we can look forward to people creating their own stories and Campaigns in the future - something which I really look forward to seeing and playing.   Get it now! It's totally worth it!  EDIT: Nominated for the ""Even better than I expected"" award. Because it truly was better than I expected...makes sense right?"

778,seanhogge,93,3,0,January 19,Recommended,97.6,"So you already know the game is good. Very positive reviews overall and recently. The devs are responsive and sensitive to the players, and it's one of the few Kickstarter projects that didn't seem to fall apart or leave everyone underwhelmed.  What I'd like to do is help you figure out what will leave you perfectly whelmed with this game.  TL;DR? It's tough to get into. I failed the first time. Experiment and mod, and you'll have a blast. The game won't keep you from fights way too tough for you. Just learn caution.  I started it maybe 18 months ago, got to the first town and quit in sort-of frustration. I had approached it all wrong. Maybe I can help others avoid the mistake. Here's what you'll need to know, I think.  This is a game of thought. The action is visceral and fun and frequent (unless you prefer it not to be), but even then you'll be most successful when you are deliberate and creative. Don't expect Dragon Age, this is more complex. Battles aren't about the amount of damage, they're about doing the right damage at the right time. You can see the action order, you can see weaknesses, you can chain things together.  The game is a challenge. Levels are significant. 4 level 10s vs 3 level 11s can be a genuinely tough fight when you're still learning mechanics and combos. Quicksave a lot. Just. Like, constantly. Trust me. It's exhilarating that any encounter can go either way, but you can easily get caught with your skivvies in the static cloud.  Don't be afraid to mod, even on your first play through. I came back after a few mods eased some annoyances and made the game slightly easier, but still a challenge. Just do whatever you need to experience the game, and don't listen to the magisters purists. The strength here is in the play, not the mechanical experience.  You can completely respec at any time, starting in Act 2. No mods needed, total freedom to move all your points. The only thing downside is that you'll have to spend money on skills if you go in a new direction. But even in Act 1, don't fret about getting every level-up right. Try wacky things.  Crafting isn't a chore. Once you know a recipe, you can just make it if you have the stuff. You can experiment like a graveyard debtor without penalty. You can ignore crafting altogether.  Leveling up, getting new equipment, and getting new skills all make an impact. All of them happen often enough that I feel like I'm more powerful in almost every fight. A single level opens up many new options. A new weapon is usually around the corner. A new skill is about to be revealed. Relish it, rookie.  Choices make a difference, not in a superficial way. But there's always a way around. Almost. If there isn't, then that's why you and I will have to play through again. I'm only in Act 2, but I already have a half-dozen things I'd like to see go a different way.  You can make mistakes. I killed a guy I needed because he got‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•that I kept asking the same question. So then I had to work around it. It was great. The devs have you, you can't get yourself into an unbeatable state, but ain't no one gonna slay the voidwoken in the closet for you. Also, if you have an undead, always check their coverings or disguise. Just sayin'. Poor townspersons.  Do you like ""gaming the game?"" Figuring out what's overpowered and exploiting it? Go for it! Me, I think that's as boring as a turtle's unrequited love laments, so if you're like me don't read a thing about min-maxing or party makeup. Just pick what you like and you can make it work and the work to do so won't be so bad because it's fun.  If you expect Diablo or Dragon Age, a one-best-way game or mindless distraction, this isn't it. I dig all of those, but this game isn't what I play to scratch those itches.  Oh, and teleport is a crazy useful skill. Make sure at least 1 person has it. FIN."

I am not usually a big fan of turn based combat and that might give people cause to pause when considering this game, it did with me anyway .... dont let that stop you though.   This is a true role playing game something we see so very rarely these days, the turn based mechanic of the combat wont get in your way. In my experance any way the game's turn based mechancis wont adversly impact your enjoyment in any way, if anything you may find you like it if only in this specific case. As to the story, world and characters they are all master strokes through and through, the massive array of options and granular details to game give it huge replayability just in terms of the main campaign and the community have added a lot more via mods and scenarios. Put simply you will get your monies worth out of this game just from the stock content then on top of that you have a great community giving you even more via Workshop and Nexus.  Cons? Nothing really, while the game isn't perfect ... simply because nothing is ... there is nothing I would see changed about it that isn't a matter of personal taste and for thouse aspects of taste the community has that covered in mods e.g. difficulty rebalance, spell effects, rate of progression, etc."

Would be great to see this fixed once they introduce more monsters to kill so you can gain a higher level before fighting this boss, otherwise it is extremely hard, unless I missed something.

790,Roger Feederer,204,3,0,"November 12, 2017",Recommended,42.8,"The true game of the year in 2017.  Hopefully the steam review system/tagging system gets this game to pop up on your store, because you probably won't hear about it from major outlets or podcasts.  I honestly thought turn based strategy had gone the way of XCOM.  Divinity, however, can be more readily compared to Dragon Age: Origins...only with more story, more character customization, interesting party members and fun yet challenging combat.  There's no need to experience any of the previous games (I didn't).  If you have ever enjoyed RPGs then play this game."

792,RainyDay,121,3,0,March 31,Recommended,129.6,"An absolutely incredible experience, without a doubt, one of the finest rpgs to date, it certainly is the best I‚Äôve ever played.  I wouldn‚Äôt know where to begin, the world is as interesting and alive as the long and beautifully crafted story, which stays strong for almost all of its entire 130h runtime.  If you‚Äôre new to rpgs, you might be put off by the inherent amount of lore and world building exposition these kinds of games often exhibit, but I must say that the game does a remarkable job of giving you all the information you need without overwhelming you. The world building is constant and just detailed enough as to make you want to fill in the details yourself using your own imagination.  Having not played the original Divinity Original Sin, I did not once feel like I was missing some important piece of lore or that I had missed out on anything story-wise, which is something I truly appreciate from the developers.  The writing is witty, fresh and fully voice acted. Not one person, monster or animal goes without a voice. The voice acting is also excellent, a pleasant surprise seeing how much has been had to be dubbed.  Combat is a lot of fun, and it only gets better the more you level up and are able to experiment with new interesting skills and combos; the only thing I feel could have been done better is how the different skill trees are explained. As it stands, only a very basic description is given, when important information, like that hydro spells are in the most part curative or that pyro spells focus more on damage should be explained somewhere. This is not such a major issue due to the fact that players are given the opportunity to respec at any time once they reach a certain point in the story (fairly early) , but still, it does make investing into certain trees a bit dangerous and daunting as a new player.  Overall, the game has provided me with a beautiful experience and I‚Äôm left reminiscing about my adventures in Rivellon alongside my memorable companions, thinking about what I could have done differently.  If you have even a passing interest in rpgs, try it, you won‚Äôt regret a second of it."

797,Nurse,648,3,0,January 15,Recommended,125.0,"My personal Review to Divinity: Original Sin 2 So, lets get this straight, this game is a master-piece.   It's a game like XCOM: Enemy Unkown its a game like The Witcher its a game like Dragon Age and many more...  Divinity is not for everyone, but it is for everyone who loves MMO/RPG/TBG Turn based game I try to be spoiler free, but i will include stuff in this review that is obvious.  Character Editor There are a few thing's that i want to talk about, mostly good. You can create your own char in this game, and it's not only for the look, it changes the gameplay for the entire game. There are a few races, Human's, Lizard's, Drawf's, Skeleton's, Elf's... Every Race has a unique talent, example: Elf's can eat body Part's and know what happened to them or what they thought about while they died, sound strange? Yes it is. But it help's you in-game to find hidden treasures or hidden quest's. Even the NPC's are reacting to your Gender/Race/Behavior.  You can choose your own Style, i dont mean hair, face, etc. i mean... how your char is reacting to things... example: I mad a Noble Lizard, that talk's like it has a stick up her‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I role-play her like she is a Annoying know-it-all.  This way, your story takes different out comes. So watch out what you pick.  The only thing that bugs me is, that i cant change how tall my char is, how the body looks... Also, some gear looks weird on the body of the chars, they look more fat in some of these, and some are way to skimpy.  There are also many trait's and Skills you can pick but thats too much to go in to... You just need to know one think... there is everything from the normal knight to cleric.  This might be a spoiler for an enemy in the game: Some races has permanent side effects.. like skeletons heal when they get poison damage, same with enemys Martin Looter King What can i say? There is a‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•tone of loot... i dont know how much and how different they are, but what i saw so far... simply -amazing-  I just noticed, here and there, some clothing and loot looks the same... different item stats, but what will you do with a such big game?  The Trading is very simple to use, easy to access, quick to understand.   Enemy's you face NPC's Sadly, this is the only point i am slighty disappointed, its not bad for me, but i think some people might notice very quickly, that there are not that many different enemy types. Yes there are plenty, but for the length of this game, it might get boring. I dont mean the fights, i mean the types, i go to the fights after this section...  Oh boy... the NPC's... Where do i start? Simply put, they all are very good written, +1 to the writer's. They never get boring, it feels like every NPC has a story... also, they all are voiced, but sometimes here and there, they dont speak, mostly for stuff like ""YOU THERE! You violated the law! Return your goods or serve your sentence!""  But still, its amazing how much time they put in to the voice acting... and the Narrator... gosh, very good job... you mostly hear his voice, he is describing EVERYTHING you see, smell, feel, do. Its truly amazing.  Sometimes you hear the same voice actor from another person... but this is not a biggy. They did the same in Oblivion, but i dont mind, some people do but not me, a simple little thing.   Multiplayer / Co-op / D&D Mode Alright, lets make this one short, There  is the PvP in alpha/beta, quite fun, then you are able to play the WHOLE Story with 3 others... other player. It's super fun, but i recommend to play with someone you know or to scream at... if you play with randoms... they attack the guard... many... times... its a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Sometimes people dont do that, but many do...  So now to the D&D section, Thats one of the best features the game can offer right next to the single-player. I recommend not to access the Game Master Mode, many spoilers there, enemy types, loot etc.  It's hard to describe, but all you need to know, its like a level editor, or like that one thing from Arma 3 Zeus mode. You can role Dice, you can possess NPC's you can do all kind of‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• But... you need to do all by your self. That means, no NPC's walking around, only you, moving people from A to b. Would be cool if they would add something like a Waypoint/patrol mode so people are walking around citys, taverns etc.   Battles, Fight's, What can you do SO, the main thing in divinity: Original Sin 2 is the battles, fights, etc.  I tried something harder then easy mode - died. You need some training in the beginning but you will find a way to deal with different enemy types and 'areas'.  By Area, i mean... You surrounding. There are some different types of 'things' laying around... Let's talk about the basic of the basic, Fire we all know it, we all hate it. You can ignite Oil with fire, you can throw oil at enemy's, you can burn an enemy and lead him in to a puddle of oil so they explode in a cool way. There are some other thinks like Water and wetness, combined with electricity... just try stuff... its super fun to combine these elements... you can also use magic to make it cursed ;)  My RatingAre there Physic's / Ragdoll in the game? - Yas How big is the map?                                   - Very big, much to explore How are the graphic's?                               - Very nice, smooth pleasent to watch people burn or acid away Fighting?                                                     - Very good, sometimes its too easy, sometimes its too hard, or just ged gud. Multiplayer?                                                - Everything works good, no disconnect stuff or lagging. Plenty of people are                                                                         playing this game Stuff to do?                                                 - Yas... A lot... you are not getting bored in this game... Replay potential?                                       - I think you could play this game like 30 times and you still wouldnt find everything in                                                this game, many secrets, many options, combine race/trait's and you will have a different out come Is it buy worthy? Yes! 100% but ONLY when you are a fan of TBG/MMO/RPG's video games. A few games as example:  XCOM: Enemy unknown Dragon Age The Witcher Mass EffectThere are just a hand full of good MMORPG's out there, and if you like turn based combat, then its the perfect game for you, you can waste so many hours in this game, finding the best way to solve problems without fighting. You coudl play this game for a long time just to find out what else is hidden in this game. Gather some friends, play D&D online master the dungeons together. When you search a game with 100% on Metacritics or 10/10 IGN- Would Burn again then... you found it. It cost a lot of money, but its worth it. I think this game was on Kickstarter once too, but just look at it... so much time and effort. If there is a game that's worth the money, it's this one."

From the character creation to party selection, you are really writing your own story. The combat is the most entertaining turn based system I have ever played. Your enemies will be very tough encounters but every encounter teaches you how to use your parties skills and the terrain to your advantage and you eventually start to win. Winning a fight in this game feels very very rewarding. If you loved the RPG's of old but want to experience them in a modern, compelling way in 2017, there is simply no better experience than Divinity: Original Sin 2  9.5/10"

Anyways, amazing game, Long story, kinda one time play through, but is the best virtual game to duplicate a TableTop RPG.  They designed it perfectly for how players want to play. With dual co-op locally, and 4 player coop online, and any mixture of the two.  Along with Dungeon master capablilty, and steam  ----needs to be fixed in these areas. If you want to play lonewolf, you will without a doubt lose and have a disadvantage later in the game from fighting events that are designed for losing turns..... THATS the problem needing to be addressed... WHY are there so many freaking lost turns in this game. Stunned makes sense, Feared, is okay. Why is knocked down the same as stunned. That destroys LoneWolfs chance and bonus, you need more members to counter lost turn CC. Why isnt it 2AP to stand up from knockdown?  And p.s.( summons is the op thing right now)"

I'm 80~ hours in, and barley halfway through."
812,Awkward,522,3,1,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,342.0,"I've got to do a full review here, because this is probably one of the best games ive ever played. The only other RPG I've been this engrossed in since childhood is probably Witcher 3. I legitimately am just looking forward to the end of my shifts at work because I want to just go back to playing D:OS2.  First, the side quests are super fleshed out and frankly revolutionary in a way that I hope sets precedents for future RPGs. Remember how we all praised witcher 3 for having a lot of side quests but none of them being simple mindless fetch-quests like in Bethseda RPGs? This game has one-upped that: the game is jampacked with side quests, none of them are fetch quests, and you have a variety of ways of completing them that can change how the quest develops and rewards you without the options being inherently wrong.   There are ways to fail the sidequests, sure, but there's also fleshed out ways of completing quests (read: It's not '""You get Dialogue B instead of Dialogue A because you clicked text Option B instead of Option A). You have unique ways that make the story of the side quest finish in unique ways which end in unique rewards. In fact, the way you complete one side quest can have a domino effect that can change other things in the game including the options you have to complete other quests. It makes the world feel alive and dynamic and I hope this becomes a RPG staple.  Second, the combat is exquisite. It's everything great about the tactical and in-depth customization Original Sin 1 had but better. New classes, a more balanced AP system, etc. Basically, you get four action points per turn that can be used to attack, to move, cast spells, etc. Typical S-RPG stuff. However, the depth of the tactics you can pull off is pretty much the best there is gaming. Just to give you an idea of how the combo system works: If you use a fire spell, the spot you hit will now be 'burning'. Walking over it will cause fire damage and set a burning DOT condition. Use a water spell? Well now it's extinguished! But there will be a steam cloud, and if you use lightning on it you can stun everyone inside that cloud. That's a small sample of what you can do: You can fly, teleport, ram, sneak, whatever you want through combat and the amount of combos and unique interactions you can find are limitless. It feels like every single 'quintessential' fantasy rpg archetype was lovingly crafted into the combat.   The game came out like a week ago and I already have 60 hours in it. All I think about when I'm at work is how much longer until I can play Divinity again. I haven't felt this way about a video game since I was a little kid. My main save has about 30 hours in it and I'm probably like 1/4 through the game (also got a 2nd save for the co-op). I haven't even touched Game Master mode (which is basically Dungeons and Dragons with full control of basically every asset in the game) and Arena (PVP) yet. I could see myself easily logging hundreds of hours on this game.  This is hands down game of the year and hands down one of the best games I've ever played. I had huge hopes for this game and was really worried it wouldn't live up to the hype. But this is hands down everything I could have wanted from a sequel to D:OS1. You're missing out if you don't get it."

I have played through the game entirely on tactian mode and can say this game has earned every bit of praise that people have put. I have spent (probably too many) hours on building a brand new character and running through a good portion on Fort Joy. The whole storyline is a amazing and the interactions between party members is on point.   The only complaint I have is that NPC's treat Fane as human until combat where the begin raining healing spells to his face as if they knew he was undead. Not a huge gripe and something you can generally ignore.

I spent over 100 hours on the starting island of Fort Joy completely f*$#ing around and having a blast.  At one point, I collected/stole basically everything I could and just laughed or nodded in respect at the wordplay/detail in the descriptions of each item.

Because Original Sin was such an amazing game, I've followed the progress of its successor's development and watched how Larian, with the help of the community, turned Original Sin 2 into an even better game.  The freedom you have in Original Sin 2 while exploring and the way you're progressing through the game is some of the best I've seen. It gave me mixed feelings of excitement and nostalgia which, at times, made me forget that I'm in the year 2017, and feel the same way that I did while playing Torment or Fallout. It felt new and enticing, the areas are varied and the content is hidden behind actually talking with people or having to read stuff to know what to do. You can mess up and miss out on quests if you kill people and your actions have consequences, I know, I killed everyone in a playtrough. NPC's are not immortal just because they have a generic quest attached to them.  If you're unsure on whether to purchase the game or not, I'll try to help.  PROS: - Varied, visual detailed and beautiful areas. No recycled content (like Generic caves 1 to 40 in Dragon Age 2); - Detailed origin stories that have an effect over multiple encounters in the game; - Fully and adequately voice acted(Apart from 1-2 encounters); - Lots of class combinations and spell interactions; - Extremely satisfying combat; - Level-dependent loot system; - Loads of exploration; - Puzzles; - A plethora of quests, fun ones; - Excellent writing; - Interesting and useful crafting system; - Actions/Consequences; - You can follow your own path and still achieve the endgame; - It does not have the price of an AAA title, it's only 45 euros and offers far more content than its competitors.  CONS:  - In the first few days the game seemed a bit rushed, there's still room for improvements/optimizations; - Using more resources than Mass Effect: Andromeda/ The Witcher 3 on Ultra seems a bit of an overkill; - Found a few placeholder items and unfinished areas; - Difficulties do not make enemies smarter or, at least, they don't appear to be doing it. It's just hp/armor/damage multiplier; - Entire difficult fights can be won instantly; - Sending items to party members is not proximity based; - Pruned talent trees compared to Original Sin;  Few of Today's companies have the dedication and experience to release a polished and entertaining product that offers huge amounts of content at such a low cost. Well, Larian did it. They released decent content in the past but their latest games have shown a huge level of interest in their users, the feedback they provide and they genuinely seemed to care about their work. I can't wait for your next game, keep up the good work guys!  "

I have never been interested in them, but with all the praise this game has been receiving, I figured I would buy it to try it out. I have been thoroughly impressed with the quality and quantity of the game thus far, especially for the cheaper price tag. The level of complexity with the combat system and crafting is unmatched, I feel like I discover new ways to play the game every few minutes. It can be a difficult game, though that makes it so satisfying when you win a battle. The game doesn't hold your hand, and my friend started out feeling overwhelmed by what we could or couldn't do. The tactical decision making sort of reminds me of Dragon Age: Origins, though more in-depth by far.   Performance is pretty good, there isn't SLI support, though you probably won't need it. The game dropped frames significantly once when surrounded by fire, smoke, gas, and electricity in a high foliage area.   I fully recommend this game if you're even remotely on the fence about it, and I look forward to spending hundreds of hours mastering different classes. The savior of the RPG genre!"

868,Beeps,97,122,5,"October 6, 2017",Not Recommended,90.0,"Much like the first game, Divinity Original Sin 2 is a fun game that seems to only be fun purely by accident. There's so much to unpack here that I genuinely suspect that the developers were just randomly throwing darts at a board to decide game elements--at best. At worst they were being intentionally lazy--possibly even intentionally provocative at points.  A lot of the major problems have been harped on about to the point where I dont' feel the need to mention them, but for the sake of the uninformed: the armor system in this game is entirely pass/fail, you either have armor and you resist everything or you don't and you resist nothing. The turn order is mindbogglingly terrible, working on a round robin (enemy goes then you go then enemy goes and repeat) system that seems to heavily favor the enemy. The game is literally unfinished, Act 4 was shuffled together out of planks of wood and has blatant cut corners in the form of poor scripting, low effort dialogue, low effort area design, pointless quests and voice acting that varies from being poor to simply not existing. Act 3 is not much better. Inventory management is somehow worse than the first game.   I think the best way I could describe the act of playing DOS2 is that if it feels like you are gaming the system, you are probably playing the game the way the developers intended. In someways this is what makes the game fun--I had a very similar experience with New Vegas, where playing the game on the yellowbrick road was boring as sin, but intentionally breaking the quests in ways that favored me was extremely satisfying. What makes DOS2 less satisfying than New Vegas, however, is that in DOS2, the things that break the game are things that the developers knew full well would break it. It is an intentionally asymmetrical experience. Things like teleporting enemies away from their allies and ganking them, planting explosive barrels around enemies before triggering a fight, stacking up on a certain resistance to the point where you heal from an element--these things are how the game is designed to be played.   This of course means that certain abilities are comparitively bad because they don't do key things like strip armor, reposition allies/enemies, heal, apply surfaces, etc. The top three non-source abilities in DOS2 (Which are probably: Teleportation, Shackles of Pain, Invisibility--which special mentions to Summon Bone Widow and Rain) are so unbelievably powerful that you are gimping yourself to an extreme degree if you do not use them. Balance was clearly of no concern here.  On Tactician mode, ""cheese strats"" like the ones I mentioned are so ubiquitious that I legitimately do not understand how the developers intended certain encounters to be beaten. Of particular note is one instance where I needed to save a lizardwoman from the gallows, who was being hung by a single tough guard and her slave. Easy enough, just kill two people. The problem was--as soon as you instigate the fight, the guard literally summons four equally strong guards from thin air, all of which are right next to her so repositioning her is useless. This *by itself* would be a very challenging encounter, but it gets better. The woman had a permanent aura on her that increased her dodging abilities and those of her allies to ludicrous degrees--meaning I basically could not hit her, or anyone around her. The way I beat this encounter was, no joke--teleporting her three times in a row, at max range, into another encounter entirely with some evil bug things, and the bugs killed her.  The encounter I just spoke about could have been talked about with the same words, but in an entirely positive tone. Because technically, I just teleported a woman three blocks away and had bugs rip her apart. And that's ""awesome"". Truth be told, it actually was somewhat fun. The crux of the issue is this: the rational person inside of me is screaming in agony when I play Divinity, while the fun-loving idiot inside of me is very satisfied. I know for a fact that this encounter was unbelivably poor. But because I beat it in a *special* way, I'm almost tricked into believing blatant disregard for things like balance, fairness, and sensibility produced something cool. It's like junk food. It's a momentary rush that quickly wears off when you realize that ""cool trick"" you pulled off was probably just a set of drapes set up to hide a super ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up game.  A lot of the encounters are like that, except some are even worse, in that the ""trick"" to the fight is the literal one way to proceed. There's a witch that will set up a MASSIVE fire resistance debuff on your party and then cast a fire spell, instantly killing the entire group. The only way to beat this fight without losing a party member is to bless the flames underneath her so you get fire immunity before she casts her debuff. Once you do that the fight is a cakewalk. It is an actual puzzle with one solution.  There are other encounters that are just laughably bad. If I played a tabletop RPG where a DM pit me against 15 slow moving clay soldiers that respawn indefinitely until one of them is killed, where each of them gets their own turn and they only have one attack, I would quit that game on the spot. There's another fight that's such a literal waste of your time it's unreal. You start out with dozens of oil slugs, which turn into more slugs, which turn into fire slugs, which ignites the oil and causes the whole area to be lit on fire, which heals the slugs and hurts you. Also every slug has a ton of HP. That fight took me FIFTY FIVE MINUTES but only took me one try.  The final fight: I audibly laughed when I realized the final battle is just an immense battle royale between three factions, where both the magisters and the antagonist's forces have 5+ people and each of them gets at least three actions per turn. I seriously just played dead with my undead characters and WATCHED the fight happen, until only one enemy remained with a tiny amount of HP. This sort of‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•should not be the optimal strategy in the climax of the game. Still somehow was not worse than the last fight of DOS1!  In my DOS1 review, I said the game was flawed to an unbelivable extent, but that I had fun, so I gave it a thumbs up. Why does that not apply here? Because the context behind the game makes the state of the product totally unforgivable.  To begin, DOS2 was a kickstarter project after DOS1 had already gotten kickstarted and been the most successful game for Larian in...ever. Additionally, DOS2 was in early access for almost a year and a half, supposedly to gain feedback to improve the product. Larian got feedback, and they ignored it. Changes to the armor system were heavily requested. Changes to the initiative system were heavily requested. Changes to the stat system were heavily requested. None of these things happened. As far as I can tell, Larian did not make a single change to the game during early access that actually made the game better, with the sole exception of adding full voice acting--which was probably planned anyway but only carried out during the pre-release hype.   The best part? DOS2 came out unfinished after a YEAR of early acess and a huge crowdfunding campaign. Even ignoring the fact that Act 4 is rushed-out trite, I cannot understand that a high-budget crowdfunded sequel was released with multiple game-breaking bugs. And I mean game breaking. I don't take this stuff lightly. About 15% of the quests I played were bugged to some extent, some of them were literally unfinishable.  When I played DOS1, I kind of got the picture that Larian knew what they were doing but were being intentionally transgressive for the sake of being different. Now that I've finished DOS2 I see things in a different light. It really does feel like they just...winged the entire game, and it almost worked. I admire their ...luck? "

Several years later and Larian Studios have done just what I hoped they would, making a sequel that retains the strengths of previous game while addressing just about every issue I had with it, and then going even further with additions like full voice acting, something not generally found in the recent wave of cRPG games. Due to the relatively high difficulty and patience required it may still not be for everybody, but Divinity: Original Sin 2 is very much at the pinnacle of the sub-genre and will no doubt prove intoxicating for those who get trapped in its spell.   continue reading [www.newgamenetwork.com] "

890,calibrojosh10,392,4,0,January 27,Recommended,100.9,"What I liked:   Improves almost every aspect from the first game     The best combat system thus far     Voice acting (I didn‚Äôt play the updated original)     Story at some parts is amazing     Game designed with co-op and solo in a CRPG???!!?! What You Need to Know:   I played this game solo (#FOREVERALONE), even though having two copies from Kickstarting the game. I would love to play the game co-op to see the game how a great game is even better with a friend competing for how the game plays.      With that out of the way, I want to start with the story. It‚Äôs all over the place. I don‚Äôt remember the story from the first one and I‚Äôll probably forget most of this game too. The first 2 acts which is about 60 hours of the game and feels at times lackluster in terms of the pacing, with only the ending of each act being amazing mostly in terms of what it makes you fight. The last 3 acts each get more focused on the main quest and side quests that branch from it. The huge time sink in the game is how many side quests you get or prevent from completing if you kill everyone.      The game does favor heavily playing the good side as after watching the ending you get 30 seconds if choosing anything other than the good option with no details on anything other than world is screwed. You choose to be good; you get over 10 minutes of details about every character you helped, companions, and the entire world in way more detail. I usually play the hero and help anyone I can and accidently picked the wrong option as it I thought it was the good choice. The whole tone at the end, is based on this final pick regardless of what you do in the rest of the game. So no matter how you play pick the good ending so you can hear your story.  The players you create can be just random dude that is standard with most RPG‚Äôs. I decided to play as the undead guy because I got the collector‚Äôs edition and he‚Äôs the statue you get, so why not. I‚Äôve never played as an undead which heals from poison, hurt from normal healing, as well as agro npc if you get naked, lol. With these premade characters of 6, they allow you get a quest for yourself and for each companion you bring along. You can also play as undead of any race too. So you get options bro.      The combat improves from the first one with two armors that while up prevents the major status effects that previously was percentage and more chanced based. I like this move to prevent save scumming for effects. You have battles taking place in areas that have verticality that can extend or block skills as well as increase or decrease damage based on the height. You have everything from the first one that I love with over one hundred skills that each have a purpose since you have elements playing a role. You get curse and blessed variants on each element. What I‚Äôm trying to say is the combat is by far my favorite so far. I‚Äôm loving turned based combat more and more with each game I play.      The game scales loot you find in the world but not quests as they are static, this saddens completing quests that are levels below you as the reward sucks. The AI you fight feels at times cheating as they never attacked my undead character with poison ever and always knew what elements are my weakness and feel like they know everything regardless of level or enemy type. This does make the game more difficult but actually plays like a real person would. I never got the feeling of laughing once at a stupid enemy messing up and healing my dude. Also when my characters are charmed they always do the dumbest stuff and use all my potions and scrolls, this was actually funny to watch and always had more than they could use. I do know the AI being too smart can be modded to feel more artificial if you don‚Äôt like that feature.       My biggest gripe is the interface to shift items around characters and when crafting no search option. This is so freaking stupid, with efforts put into teleporting items to relevant characters when needed for actions to save tedious shifting items; they forgot that when you pick up everything, I have a lot of crap sort to which player to give to. This is tedious when doing by item. Let us set items to go to certain players that use those items like arrows, grenades, and armor. So much time is wasted sorting and finding out who needs what item. Also crafting when you have hundreds of materials is hard to find the one you need. Dear god this was annoying at times. Not enough to‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•me off, but enough to annoy me.      Crafting is no longer a skill to put points into; you learn recipes and anyone can craft them. This sounds nice but I never really crafted until the end to prepare for the last fight. So that feature felt lackluster compared to the first game.       Overall the game is another instant classic just like the original. You don‚Äôt have to play the first one to understand this one. The combat has so much depth in it and was the main draw for me and did not disappoint. The story overall only felt epic at ends of each act with some fun side quests, especially the animal ones. I love the pet pal talent. All the major side quests had satisfying endings and I can‚Äôt wait for a 3rd game. These devs have made me to understand why old school RPG‚Äôs are the best and can‚Äôt go back to shallow ones anymore. Thanks Larian Studios for showing me da wae of CRPG‚Äôs as I‚Äôm still new to the genre, as to why I don‚Äôt have much recommendations.    My Score: A+ Paid: $135 Completed in: 90 hours  Games similar I recommend:   Magicka  ( pure magic combat)     UnderRail ( has some flaws)    Pillars of Eternity 2  (Haven‚Äôt played either game yet.

I must admit I was disapointed after few playing hours to realize RPG content isnt as deeply as classic aD&D games and Builder very different of what I hoped with a just succession of very small maps.   If you got in your group someone who speaks with animals, have good persuasion and wits scores, with only DamageDealers you're sure you'll miss nothing and progress easely : quests are interesting but dont need any analysis or long searchs, no mortal traps anywhere, no oneshots (maybe with Alice or missing in making Hannag one of your friends), no wipes (except being too optimistic with Adrahmalihk), quite nothing to detect, quite nothing to miss anywhere (Braccus legs ?) and finaly a hardest difficulty mode ""too soft"" for most of players.  So... how explain our actual 600hours on DOS2 HM with many diff√©rent groups and choices (magical, physical, distants, ranges, with  tank, with only DD, 2 lonewolves, wipe maps in genocides, or pacifist ""just alone"") ? For me the biggest quality of this game isnt RPG at all but by-turn-combat options and strategies, with many different builds choices and mix for each member. Every tactical/HM combat is a +/- complex arena where you must analyze options and ways to success. Concerning GameMastering Leaks are finaly forces : this part of game must be seen as a way to play exactly the way you RPG-play around a table, and not to create a big scripted world like with Aurora (NeverwinterNights).   Except minor changes in menus, dialogs, a global easier game (...), a new strange corpses ragdoll animation and a bigger game folder, sorry to see DefinityEdition bringing nothing more. But DOS2 is one of the most dynamic and interesting games I played with friends for many years."

907,@Neiffarious,236,4,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,57.6,"So my brother and I played through most of the first act. I'm not saying that we got through most of the content because I'm sure there is stuff we missed out on for whatever reason. Playing through the first act was very exciting. Although I must admit it started out a little bit slowly, but i feel like a lot of games in this genre can have kind of a slow start, in part because there is so much to do you might feel overwhelmed.  I'm not going to get into great detail about any of this, i'm not professional reviewer, but I'm going to adress some things that are pretty important to me when deciding whether or not to buy a game:  Is it worth getting this game in early access? - In my opinion, as a big fan of this genre, yes There is probably 10-13 hours of content if you try to do EVERYTHING. More content to be added such as New playable undead race, more origin stories, new areas to explore etc. There is so much content coming and so much that I missed out on as well. there are a few bugs. keep that in mind.   How is it mechanically to the first Original Sin? - A drastically better inventory system, skill system seems to be much deeper, and there is a bit more variety in ways to play as each skill point provides some kind of bonus besides just allowing you to use higher level skills IE: Necromancy gives you lifesteal, or Hunstman reduces the penalty for firing from low ground gives a bonus for attacking from high ground etc. etc.  Bugs?  - Yes, a few that really stuck out: Blank Conversation boxes that require a reload to escape from, quests unable to be complete even with all the items in your inventory, and smaller ones like ressurecting a character but instead of standing up they slide around the ground. These kinds of things are 100% expected in early access so avoid this game if you aren't willing to try to squash them.  How is the Story?  - Personally I find it much more engaging this time around. As a Sourceror there is a lot more room to be the bad guy if you would prefer it. In the first one it didn't make much sense to be an Evil Source hunter. I don't want to spoil anything at all but there were a lot of moments, even in side quests, that I thought were really cool. Some kinda sad stuff too with the Pet Pal Talent (Which lets you talk to animals).  Overall, I found it to be very worthwhile. I am excited to see new content added and bugs fixed as time goes by. So far, Larian is really knocking it out of the park.   TL;DR: I really enjoyed it. It is not yet complete. IF you're a fan of isometric or old-school RPGs this game is for you. Co-Op is fun. Skill system is neato. If you want a super complete experience this is not the game for you. Hope this helped someone!"
908,Arumin,260,4,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,54.9,"If you like PC-style top-down RPG's, you have to get this game. It's really quite that simple.  People here have already given descriptions left and right in their reviews, I've very little to add to that. Sufficed to say that where Larian's Original Sin (1) was already a very good game, but had minor nuisances here and there, this one, at fricking Early Access Alpha, already felt, looked, and played like a true AAA title. Everything that was in Original Sin has been improved many fold, all the flaws and nuisances fixed, all the good things perfected, and so, so much more added on top. So much so, that I'd have to write a novel to cover it all.  The age of RPG's - in my opinion - has been in decline for a good 10 years with previous big players like BioWare and Bethesda being stuck, even backtracking in their production of quality games. CD Projekt Red managed to start a new evolution of AAA RPG titles with its brilliant Witcher 3, but has so far seen no even remotely serious competition. Now, having played Original Sin 2, it's blatantly obvious that barring some extremely unlikely U-turns in the full release, Larian Studios will be cementing its position as the latest Gold producer with Midas' touch.  The overwhelmingly positive reviews in Steam and everywhere else are not a coincidence, as it's easy to see that this game will be a BIG deal. It's quite simply that insanely good."

921,Dimmie,192,4,0,"September 5, 2017",Recommended,136.2,"28.8 Hours on Record, and that's how long it took me to complete the full Fort Joy & Swamp areas.  I know the early access is missing a lot, which only makes me want this game more, and more with every passing minute- especially after watching the developer video speaking about the playable undead (Undead being my favorite race in most any game I've played).  28.8 Hours on Record, and there are STILL things I haven't fully figured out, still quests I feel like I left incomplete. Still things I think I might be able to do, yet I couldn't figure out the answer.  For the early access content (Which I assume is not even close to what they've gotten completed right now), I was more then satisfied. I was seeking a create your own character game with an in-depth story, with some lovable and quirky companions, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 has scratched that itch.  I cannot wait for the full release and will likely try other actions and combonations on the side. And the fact that I can just get Lohse & Ifen as my companions and I'm not shoehorned into accepting anyone else pleases me beyond belief- It allows for some fun immersive experiences.  I want this game to be out so very badly, like the full release. I yearn for it and I'm giddy with anticipation- Couldn't recommend it more, especially for someone who has been craving a create your own character and a LOT of story driven content.  --------  I've decided to put a bit of an edit into my review.  Mostly to make a comparison of the Alpha version of Divinity Original Sin 2 and the Enhanced version of Divinity Original Sin- albeit I've only gotten 14 hours down on the first game.  First off the Character Creator:  (Divinity Original Sin, Enhanced Edition/The First Game) The main difference for me in regards to the character creator is the characters pasts. I'm someone who likes to feel immersed as the 'average jane' sort of character. A nobody, so needless to say in the original Divinity Original Sin game, I wasn't exactly fond of the backstories the customizable characters were given. The Source Hunters were established ""Bad Asses"" so to speak, no matter what class you picked there was a backstory explaining exactly how skilled they were.  There was no build up to your characters esteemed position. You were a Source Hunter, you're both well respected and somewhat hated/envied. You could be this rogue who was caught doing a job, a knight who was the last survivor of some kind of knightly house, a Witch that actually faced off against the Source Hunters until the 'Leader' asked for your assistance. Although each little back story was beautifully tailored, it left me with a feeling of: ""These characters are woven, personalities set.""  Which in turn, made me feel like if I replayed the game.. Although there are differing dialogue choices, decisions, and options.. The past of the Customized PC's makes it feel as if I'm just replaying the same people. (Mind you this is from my perspective)  (Divinity Original Sin 2, The Alpha Release) The Alpha Release is not the final product, so this portion of the review may change. However, from the most recent streams Larian's shown the public, it seems that the customized character is far more 'Pastless'. For people like me this is a fun immersive/roleplay aspect. I can, as an example, play a character who semi-leans towards the Magister's methods and refuses to use Source, and believes that locking away Source is the best course ofa ction. Although I doubt it's possible to keep the collar on the entire game (Something I will try to do on full release), it is still something I can mold as a 'past'.   I could throw them a background as a Soldier and a Scholar, I could go with the idea that they lost a loved one to the voidwaken when my character had first used their source abilities and that is why they refuse to use Source any longer. Not only that but each dialogue option doesn't make my character out to be a bonafied badass. As a simple example, if I choose the Soldier background and meet a certain NPC with a soldier background, there is an option to salute them- the salute feels like it implies that my character was beneath the other characters Rank. Whereas they once commanded, my character was merely a grunt.  There is a lot more growth from an immersive self-RP perspective, a lot more variety I feel. Though once again this is a personal opinion!  Companions:  (Divinity Original Sin, Enhanced Edition/The First Game) I've only met three companions in the first game, the man in the library, the locked up wild woman, the veteran source hunter, and the thief. Now I haven't really dealt with the library man but the Source Hunter & Thief are the ones I run with constantly. They do have the occassional smidgen of dialogue (perhaps this branches out later in the game, this is just me talking from a 14 hour period, which is half of what I played in Divinity Original Sin 2 to complete the alpha areas). However I don't feel.. Very connected to them, NPCs refuse to talk to them and would prefer ""Talking to the leader."" sure they may be fleshed out but as I see them they're.. Just nice things that punch stuff. With the occassional quip here and there. I'll likely play more Divinity Original Sin enhanced edition and change this opinion but for now I'm not too interested in the companions.  (Divinity Original Sin 2, The Alpha Release) The amount of love and care that went into these companions astounds me. They feel alive, and that's in the ALPHA of all things. Each is distinct, if someone offhandedly mentioned ""That one character that talks about boats."" I'd know it was Beast, and he isn't even a companion in the alpha!   Another example is Ifen, he is labeled with a tag called ""Villain"" in the alpha, I'm not sure if that will be there on release, but there are dialogue choices he can sue with that tag. It's implied that he's a horrible individual, but if you look at his personality, he is much more the  just a ""Villain"". He stood up for an elf when humans were rabbling her, he does not approve of killing an animal in an area that can be killed because it is disgusting. He's only a villain, because the world has ousted him as one- he's a mercenary, he's infamous, he's feared. But he's also someone who loves animals, someone that doesn't really enjoy bullying others that are 'lower on the food chain', he isn't a fan of senseless killing but kills only because it's his ""Job"". For an alpha, there was so much insane depth to him.  I didn't use Sibble or Prince much, but every interraction with them that I had, made them out to be people. Not a piece of the scenary or a meat wall that was needed to throw in front of swords.  ----  I'm sure there are things the original does better then the second- albeit I've yet to find that out. Some may say the combat, but the combat in #2 feels much more strategetic. I can't just strong arm my way through the combat like I do in 1, quite frequently at that. Perhaps I am just naturally biased, but, I think that #2 beats #1 in all categories. I enjoy both the alpha of dinivty original sin 2, and the enhanced edition of the original Divinity Original Sin.  However, I can find myself lost in #2 for hours (As seen by my 40 hours put in even after completing everything I could at 28 Hours), whereas in #1 I need to take breaks due to growing.. Bored."

926,ShrimpDawgy227,71,4,0,"December 3, 2017",Recommended,47.5,"BUY THIS GAME! Boom. Review over. Oh, you want more? Well you need to pay $1000 for the next 10 lines.   This game does not do that. For 33 USD (For the deluxe edition), this game offers a lot more than most AAA titles in the past months, or even years. This review is here to hopefully show you how much you NEED this game. (Note: Not all the games content is able to fit into one review, so I will try to keep this as short as possible.)                                                     DIVINITY: ORIGINAL SIN 2 Review (Spoilers Ahead)   Story:  I have played a few modern  RPGs in my life. Mass Effect, Dragon Age, SWOTR, Skyrim, Fallout, Phantasy Star, Final Fantasy, but none of them really hold a candle to how much content and diversity this game contains. The story itself is continued after the events of Original Sin, but taake place hundreds of years after, meaning that there is no need to play the original to know what happens here. You play as a Sourcerer, a being able to tap into the misterious Source to use powers that are deemed too dangerous for the public.   I won't go too in detail on that, but from there, your journey begins. When I say ""your"" I don't really mean JUST your character that you made for the game, but YOU as well. This game makes YOU an integral part of the story, not just your character. You can traverse the world and do whatever you want.   The best part of the story is that it is non-linear. Hell, the entire game isn't linear, but I'll get to that. Any and EVERY choice that you make has an impact on, not just the story itself, but the lives of everybody around you, and it shows. The story can be played hundreds of times and still feel fresh. Different ""tags"" that you get/use (talked about in character customization) allow you to interact with people differently. What race you choose also makes a huge impact on how characters interact with you.   In this game, there are 6 different ""origin characters"" that allow you to experience their story through their point of view. I haven't done this myself (having only 38 hours into the game at the time of this review) but it is interesting to see the world through their eyes. If you don't want to, you can always use your own character and recruit them as ""allies.""  Note that in this game, your companions stories play out alongside yours. Choices will have to be made. Thats all I'm saying about that.  This game also allows for friends to enter your game alongside you. Many different things can happen, and you may end up fighting each other if you decide against it.   Quests can be found anywhere, especially NPC's. Depending on your choices however, they may be harsher to you, or maybe even not give you the quest in the first place.    Character Customizations:  This is arguably the least amazing thing in the game, which is saying something because it is still better than most other RPG creation systems. You can customize anything from a persons style, to their tags (which are sort of like occupations, which affect the story and dialogue.) It is here that you can also choose what class you are going to be. I won't go into too much detail, but know that choosing a class doesn't mean that you stay that class forever. You can spec your character into whatever class you want. One should note however that your beginning weapon is determined by your class.  You can also choose your atributes and skills in this section. Note that these affect your beginning character, and possibly your end game character if you stay on the road that you started.    Combat:  The flexibility of the story applies to combat as well. There are dmany different skills that you can choose from, which can be learned using books. Note that it is impossible to learn a skill if you don't have the right stats for it. There are many different ways a battle can go.. especially since the AI is good on higher difficulties.   There are different elements that can be used to your advantage. These elements give different debuffs to your oponents, but not all of them are effective as there are resistances. With the introduction of Divinity Original Sin 2 comes armor. These values are found on top of the health bar, and they serve the purpose of negating any and all debuffs, so you need to take care of that first.   In this game, you might notice some elements on the ground. If you happen to hit it either with a skill or basic attack, it turns into something different. For example, if an enemy is standing on a pudddle, you can use an electricity skill to stun them and cause them to lose a turn. Or, if they are standing on oil, using fire would cause an explosion, dealing damage as well as DOT. The possibilities are endless.   The only limit to combat is how many action points you have. This can be increased with the use of armor and skills, but I won't get too into that.    Music/Voice Acting:  For a game that almost didn't have voice acting, it is done pretty damn well. Every character is fully voiced. With a certain perk that even allows you to talk to and get quests from animals. Its 100% amazing. Over 1,000,000 lines of dialogue was recorded for this game, and each one really pushes the game along  The music is superb. Both thematic and atmospheric, it really helps immerse you in the world of Divinity. You can even choose which of 4 instruments will be playing during the game. It is amazing.   Mods and Downloads:  Aside from all of this content, Larian has decided that this game needed mods. They also allowed players to make their own stories using the ingame assets, which, for a 33 dollar game is astounding. While I would say that mods and downloads aren't NEEDED for the game to be amazing, it really adds to the replayability of the game as a whole. Note that using mods will disable achievements for the game, so you achievement hunters out there will need to play without them.   Multiplayer:  Sometimes, it gets a little lonely, so playing with friends is an option, and in my opinion, a MUST TRY. You can play with up to 4 players online, and 2 on split screen (YES THERE IS SPLITSCREEN.) They can help you do many things... of which I shouldn't spoil. You can even sabotage them when fighting, and you can even initiate PVP with them.   Speaking of PVP, there is a designated area for such, where you team up with others in order for you to kill your oponents. I haven't played the game mode myself, but it does look fun.    Closing Thoughts:  BUY THIS ALREADY. "

The first was already great, good combat, and an okay story. A fun rpg all around. This is great because this is only a small, unfinished portion of the game, and it's so full of content. Several characters each with their own stories, custom characters with their own story. I have 60ish hours and still find new things each time I play through it. So many different interactions with various elements. New spells, magic schools, and more. If you like cRPGS, or the last game  and don't wanna wait, then I'd buy this game for sure. Hopefully this is a trend that stays throughout the rest of the development cycle."

Do not allow for Larian to gather information about your PC though, it can cause problems (see my thread in technical probles thread). And one thing I really dislike - it's too slow. It was like that in DOS 1 but I hoped they would improve it in this one, everyone walks and fights in slow motion.  Edit: They've added fa_ggots, a huge flaw in my book. Can't bigger studios make a game without these sick people, for once..."
932,TheDuke,313,4,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,96.8,"I know larian for a long time now, maybe because their headquarters are in my hometown, maybe because they just make awesome games. Or both. So when they announced they would start a kickstarter campaign for this game (the sequel to divinity orginal sin, suprise I guess when there is the number 2 involved in a title, I immediately signed up for it. I saw the game grow from within the kickstartes, I saw Swens comments on the changes, it all looked and felt so good. For backers they had some polls on what we wanted them to focus on. And, by Jove, did they pull our requests off. This game is awesome, storywise, gameplaywise, sound&musicwise,... (image a ton of more wises ;-) )If you are into RPG's, play this game! Take your time to explore it all, take your time for several replays of the game because the world is so open yo have so many opportunities you do not get all quests, storylines, characterdevelopments in one playthrough! Invest in this game and let the times pass, it will be next year before you know it. Before I forget it, this game can even be played in co-op (up to 4 players), what else do you need (maybe some beer, chips and a girlfriend, but that's not important now) For d&d fans they even implemented a game master mode (with one d&d campaign already worked out for your party!) to make sure you will never ever have to play the same story. Find yourself a good dungeom master and prepare to have some amazing adventures. Must buy! 13/10 for the Bronts among you."

People here have already given descriptions left and right in their reviews, I've very little to add to that. Sufficed to say that where Larian's Original Sin (1) was already a very good game, but had minor nuisances here and there, this one, at fricking Early Access Alpha, already felt, looked, and played like a true AAA title. Everything that was in Original Sin has been improved many fold, all the flaws and nuisances fixed, all the good things perfected, and so, so much more added on top. So much so, that I'd have to write a novel to cover it all.  The age of RPG's - in my opinion - has been in decline for a good 10 years with previous big players like BioWare and Bethesda being stuck, even backtracking in their production of quality games. CD Projekt Red managed to start a new evolution of AAA RPG titles with its brilliant Witcher 3, but has so far seen no even remotely serious competition. Now, having played Original Sin 2, it's blatantly obvious that barring some extremely unlikely U-turns in the full release, Larian Studios will be cementing its position as the latest Gold producer with Midas' touch.  The overwhelmingly positive reviews in Steam and everywhere else are not a coincidence, as it's easy to see that this game will be a BIG deal. It's quite simply that insanely good."

It blows my mind that games of this quality and quantity (I'm 27 hours in and am not even off the first island, who know how much more gameplay there is) can exist and ask for $44.99 and not be on the front of every gaming website, while these triple A titles asking $60 chocked full of micro transactions are selling copies by the millions.

951,@Neiffarious,236,4,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,57.6,"So my brother and I played through most of the first act. I'm not saying that we got through most of the content because I'm sure there is stuff we missed out on for whatever reason. Playing through the first act was very exciting. Although I must admit it started out a little bit slowly, but i feel like a lot of games in this genre can have kind of a slow start, in part because there is so much to do you might feel overwhelmed.  I'm not going to get into great detail about any of this, i'm not professional reviewer, but I'm going to adress some things that are pretty important to me when deciding whether or not to buy a game:  Is it worth getting this game in early access? - In my opinion, as a big fan of this genre, yes There is probably 10-13 hours of content if you try to do EVERYTHING. More content to be added such as New playable undead race, more origin stories, new areas to explore etc. There is so much content coming and so much that I missed out on as well. there are a few bugs. keep that in mind.   How is it mechanically to the first Original Sin? - A drastically better inventory system, skill system seems to be much deeper, and there is a bit more variety in ways to play as each skill point provides some kind of bonus besides just allowing you to use higher level skills IE: Necromancy gives you lifesteal, or Hunstman reduces the penalty for firing from low ground gives a bonus for attacking from high ground etc. etc.  Bugs?  - Yes, a few that really stuck out: Blank Conversation boxes that require a reload to escape from, quests unable to be complete even with all the items in your inventory, and smaller ones like ressurecting a character but instead of standing up they slide around the ground. These kinds of things are 100% expected in early access so avoid this game if you aren't willing to try to squash them.  How is the Story?  - Personally I find it much more engaging this time around. As a Sourceror there is a lot more room to be the bad guy if you would prefer it. In the first one it didn't make much sense to be an Evil Source hunter. I don't want to spoil anything at all but there were a lot of moments, even in side quests, that I thought were really cool. Some kinda sad stuff too with the Pet Pal Talent (Which lets you talk to animals).  Overall, I found it to be very worthwhile. I am excited to see new content added and bugs fixed as time goes by. So far, Larian is really knocking it out of the park.   TL;DR: I really enjoyed it. It is not yet complete. IF you're a fan of isometric or old-school RPGs this game is for you. Co-Op is fun. Skill system is neato. If you want a super complete experience this is not the game for you. Hope this helped someone!"

955,calibrojosh10,392,4,0,January 27,Recommended,100.9,"What I liked:   Improves almost every aspect from the first game     The best combat system thus far     Voice acting (I didn‚Äôt play the updated original)     Story at some parts is amazing     Game designed with co-op and solo in a CRPG???!!?! What You Need to Know:   I played this game solo (#FOREVERALONE), even though having two copies from Kickstarting the game. I would love to play the game co-op to see the game how a great game is even better with a friend competing for how the game plays.      With that out of the way, I want to start with the story. It‚Äôs all over the place. I don‚Äôt remember the story from the first one and I‚Äôll probably forget most of this game too. The first 2 acts which is about 60 hours of the game and feels at times lackluster in terms of the pacing, with only the ending of each act being amazing mostly in terms of what it makes you fight. The last 3 acts each get more focused on the main quest and side quests that branch from it. The huge time sink in the game is how many side quests you get or prevent from completing if you kill everyone.      The game does favor heavily playing the good side as after watching the ending you get 30 seconds if choosing anything other than the good option with no details on anything other than world is screwed. You choose to be good; you get over 10 minutes of details about every character you helped, companions, and the entire world in way more detail. I usually play the hero and help anyone I can and accidently picked the wrong option as it I thought it was the good choice. The whole tone at the end, is based on this final pick regardless of what you do in the rest of the game. So no matter how you play pick the good ending so you can hear your story.  The players you create can be just random dude that is standard with most RPG‚Äôs. I decided to play as the undead guy because I got the collector‚Äôs edition and he‚Äôs the statue you get, so why not. I‚Äôve never played as an undead which heals from poison, hurt from normal healing, as well as agro npc if you get naked, lol. With these premade characters of 6, they allow you get a quest for yourself and for each companion you bring along. You can also play as undead of any race too. So you get options bro.      The combat improves from the first one with two armors that while up prevents the major status effects that previously was percentage and more chanced based. I like this move to prevent save scumming for effects. You have battles taking place in areas that have verticality that can extend or block skills as well as increase or decrease damage based on the height. You have everything from the first one that I love with over one hundred skills that each have a purpose since you have elements playing a role. You get curse and blessed variants on each element. What I‚Äôm trying to say is the combat is by far my favorite so far. I‚Äôm loving turned based combat more and more with each game I play.      The game scales loot you find in the world but not quests as they are static, this saddens completing quests that are levels below you as the reward sucks. The AI you fight feels at times cheating as they never attacked my undead character with poison ever and always knew what elements are my weakness and feel like they know everything regardless of level or enemy type. This does make the game more difficult but actually plays like a real person would. I never got the feeling of laughing once at a stupid enemy messing up and healing my dude. Also when my characters are charmed they always do the dumbest stuff and use all my potions and scrolls, this was actually funny to watch and always had more than they could use. I do know the AI being too smart can be modded to feel more artificial if you don‚Äôt like that feature.       My biggest gripe is the interface to shift items around characters and when crafting no search option. This is so freaking stupid, with efforts put into teleporting items to relevant characters when needed for actions to save tedious shifting items; they forgot that when you pick up everything, I have a lot of crap sort to which player to give to. This is tedious when doing by item. Let us set items to go to certain players that use those items like arrows, grenades, and armor. So much time is wasted sorting and finding out who needs what item. Also crafting when you have hundreds of materials is hard to find the one you need. Dear god this was annoying at times. Not enough to‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•me off, but enough to annoy me.      Crafting is no longer a skill to put points into; you learn recipes and anyone can craft them. This sounds nice but I never really crafted until the end to prepare for the last fight. So that feature felt lackluster compared to the first game.       Overall the game is another instant classic just like the original. You don‚Äôt have to play the first one to understand this one. The combat has so much depth in it and was the main draw for me and did not disappoint. The story overall only felt epic at ends of each act with some fun side quests, especially the animal ones. I love the pet pal talent. All the major side quests had satisfying endings and I can‚Äôt wait for a 3rd game. These devs have made me to understand why old school RPG‚Äôs are the best and can‚Äôt go back to shallow ones anymore. Thanks Larian Studios for showing me da wae of CRPG‚Äôs as I‚Äôm still new to the genre, as to why I don‚Äôt have much recommendations.    My Score: A+ Paid: $135 Completed in: 90 hours  Games similar I recommend:   Magicka  ( pure magic combat)     UnderRail ( has some flaws)    Pillars of Eternity 2  (Haven‚Äôt played either game yet.

It blows my mind that games of this quality and quantity (I'm 27 hours in and am not even off the first island, who know how much more gameplay there is) can exist and ask for $44.99 and not be on the front of every gaming website, while these triple A titles asking $60 chocked full of micro transactions are selling copies by the millions.  To Larian Studios, thank you for making this game. It is going to go down in history of one of my favorite games."

970,Liefwarrior,242,4,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,177.6,"Wow, where do I begin?  First off, Larian Studios is a company who respects the people who play their games.  Did you notice the price of the game?  Did you also notice that shiny Divine Edition with the awesome artwork and music?  I know that one thing I didn't notice was a bunch of content locked behind a paywall (Destiny has me jaded at this point).  DoS2 as a game respects the players more so than any game I've played since the good old Morrowind or Baldur's Gate days.  The way you explore this world they've crafted for you is completely up to you, because Larian Studios are a company who *respects* the way you want to play their game.  Any number of the bizarre scenarios you may find yourself in during the potentially 100+ hours of content can be reacted to with an equally large number of solutions.  You will get as much out of it as you invest into it, creativity will get you a long ways and will feel very rewarding.  The voice acting is wonderful, and every NPC in the game is fully voiced.  Even the narrator is voiced, the only lines that won't be read to you are the things you select to say for yourself (which is standard).  You really get the feeling that the NPCs have a life of their own and that the world is moving on with or without you.  The marks you leave on the world are very real, every monster/creature/villain/person you slay will never be back.  You may walk through the area much later and expect some battle with skeletons that you remembered from before, but this isn't Pokemon.  Once you kill something it never comes back.  Including you.   Perma-death is handled interestingly in DoS2, your character can die like any other, permanently.  It's got something akin to the D&D equivalent of resurrection with scrolls and spell you can buy from some vendors.  They won't be affordable for at least 10-20 hours into the game however, if you find yourself frequently dying in the first 10 hours of the game expect to empty your coffers on resurrection scrolls instead of that shiny sword you've been eying.  It works though, death SHOULD be punishing in a role-playing game, and this is just the right balance between death being too punishing and meaning nothing.    Combat always feels really good, and there's unlimited creativity you have when you're going about it.  The environment is entirely interactive.  Want to use a barrel as cover?  Sure.  Want to use telekinesis to move that barrel of oil towards your enemies and then set it on fire?  Sure.  Screw the barrel, I'll make it rain and freeze the ground and then combine my boots with nails in the crafting menu, now they're slipping all over the place but I can walk around like a champ.  Or sneak through the fight all together.  Or talk your way out.  There's so many ways to handle it.  I wholeheartedly recommend this game.  I've beaten it with about 65 hours but I was playing with no companions and with a Lone Wolf perk, there were SO many things I didn't see.  I've got 6 campaigns in progress and I'm still finding new stuff every day.  You'll thank yourself for getting this game."

This game is a throwback to the glory days of crpgs like Baldurs Gate, Fallout and many more. Decisions matter, your party matters, everything you do matters. Not only that, but it also offers a rich world, where things happen around you wether you intervene or not. To top it off, the game looks great and has the best soundtrack and sound design I have ever heard.  On the other hand you have some minor continuity issues that can prop up if you take the open invitation of the game to play your own way to the extreme and some clunkyness with the UI. Nothing too major, those are things I can tolerate in a game that comes along fully voiced.  Comparing this title to other so called RPG's of modern times bar the Witcher series reveals a lot about the state of the industry. Larian gives the big names like Bethesda or Bioware a run for their money with this masterpiece.

1002,Mr. ZAion,111,5,0,"July 10, 2017",Recommended,219.6,"il gioco √® altamente consigliabile, anche se ha vari punti che lo rendono meno appetibile del suo predecessore.  Una volta abbandonato fort joy col tuo party, quel party ti rimane. gli altri personaggi non scelti vengono eliminati o comunque non sono recrutabili. Male a mio avviso, nel capitolo precedente potevo completare le storie di tutti i personaggi , qui no. Questo limita anche il volere creare un personaggio del tutto nuovo nuovo. se i personaggi principali della storia sono 6, e il party contiene al max 4 pg, se creo un personaggio ex novo non potr√≤ vedere la storia di ben 3 personaggi principali. vale la pena quindi usare i personaggi ""prefabbricati"". grave mancanza a mio parere, se lo fanno per farmelo giocare pi√π volte , per me non ha comunque senso.  La trama PRINCIPALE non √® all altezza del gioco. √® piuttosto banale anzi, anche questa mancanza grave, che sposta gli equilibri da ""capolavoro"" a ""ottimo gioco"". poca roba direte voi, ottimo √® ottimo. NO, perch√® capolavoro √® capolavoro.  L'inglese utilzzato con alcuni termini ""arcaici"" e la mole mastodontica di dialoghi con cui ci si scontra rendono il gioco faticoso anche per chi conosce l'inglese, si rischia di perdere parte della storia , se gioco per 3/4 ore e devo mettermi a leggere e tradurre tutto quello che c'√® scritto, di quelle 3/4 ore ne perdo almeno una, una e mezza. Ovvio che alla lunga viene da saltare alcuni di questi dialoghi, e rischi di trovarti a non capire il proseguimento della trama.  Il gioco √® comunque molto consigliabile, ma  gli autori si sono un po fatti prendere la mano, hanno aggiunto tanta carne al fuoco, troppa, per me, rendendo il gioco faticoso da finire, un po come se tu fossi a una grigliata di carne buonissima, ma ce n'√® talmente tanta che ti costringi a finirla, non per fame ma perch√® non vuoi sprecarne, ma alla fine ti senti un p√≤ stomacato e forzato."

The game, upon release looks and feels incredible, and yes - there are a few bugs, but with how immense this game is, it's really nothing I wasn't expecting.  ALL of my previous ""Cons"" have been resolved as of release. There is legitimately nothing bad I can say about this game, it is one of the best games I've ever played, It's equal to (and sometimes greater than) Witcher 3 in almost every respect.  This game is one we will be talking about for years to come, it's an instant classic, and if have even the slightest enjoyment in tactical combat and deep RPG gameplay, this game is for you.  That's all i'm going to write for now, I have more of Rivellon to explore!      Update 1: It took me approximately 30 hours to finish the entirety of the first act (Note: I left some side-quests unfinished, and this involved few deaths.)  My pros and cons remain unchanged, but i would like to throw out some more things i noticed.  This game has more challenging combat that D:OS EE, I found that even on the ""Classic"" difficulty, the combat encounters were on-par with (If not slightly easier) than playing on tactician mode of D:OS EE.  If you thought D:OS was too easy, this game improves on that quite a bit.  This game also has more decisions for your character to make, and even this early in EA you can see where they intend to take things.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   22 Hours in, still not finished with the first act, this game was worth the purchase even during Early Access.   Pros: * Polished Feel * VERY descriptive dialogue * Challenging Encounters * Entertaining Spells * Divinity Game  Cons: * Beginning is quite difficult, as the game doesn't explain where you should go. But this was present in D:OS Classic as well. * Leveling up doesn't feel as fun anymore, since you only get one ""Talent"" every 4 levels (This includes talents for Sneak, etc.) * Party dialogue system is unfinished (Early Access)   On the whole, This game managed to pull me in just like D:OS Classic, and i look forward to many more hours in rivellon."

1008,skullplace,337,69,3,"October 8, 2017",Not Recommended,64.7,"The story and mood of the game, while a step up from the first, quickly starts to fall apart the further you get into it. The disjointed nature of the story really hurts the game, despite having such a strong start with Fort Joy, which was easily ten times better than Cyseal (though it lacked the same charm). The dual dialogue system being gone also means that co-op interractions have a lot less weight to them; similarly, origin characters don't really have interactions with each other, which really brings the experience down at times. The disjointed story becomes especially apparent after Fort Joy. It's revealed the player character is a Godwoken, and depending on your race, you represent your God and must become Divine. The Gods push the whole ""war against the other gods/races"" thing a lot, but when the time comes around where its every man for himself, its quickly resolved by the the antagonist, Dallis, and now our Gods just hate us in general and its no longer a plot point that matters. Even the endings of the game are all a let down, with the outcomes being very general... you could honestly compare it to the Mass Effect 3 endings.  The biggest problem with this game is that combat scenarios are far too similar to one another, thanks to the armor system. Unlike the first game, crowd control and status effects must first go through physical or magic armor, or else they are completely resisted by the target. While, in the beginning, it seemed like a nice solution to fix the problem the first game had, where you could CC targets one after the other and just wail on them for free, the armor system REALLY hurts the point of elemental surfaces and the like. Outside of Fort Joy, I found no use for them; everything just had too much armor for anything to work. Your strongest abilities were the only thing that did much of anything, and if you were a magic user, using a staff for damage was awful as wands were a lot stronger.  Skills, stats and talents are all pretty homogenized in the game. Strength, finesse, and intelligence are all ""more damage"". Memory gives you more slots for more abilities, and wits gives you more crit chance and lets you detect treasures (you can supplement this for a wits potion or the clear minded ability, since the amount of wits you need to detect stuff is pretty low). For melee builds, Necromancer is almost a must, because the health returns and utility of many necromancer abilities are irreplacable. For any character, though, being a hybrid (unless you are just a full mage) is a must because many abilities in each magic tree do not rely on intelligence to be useful. It lets your characters have much more access to abilities outside of Warfare, Scoundrel, and Huntsman, but some just aren't good or don't really add much in the way of variety, except for Necromancer. Civil abilities vary in their usefulness, but one that I found particularly vexing was persuasion. Sometimes, you can't really control who an NPC talks to during certain events, and if you lack persuasion, you may end up missing out on certain events. Some dialogues have stat checks, but they still require persuasion to do anything. I suppose I was expecting it to be like an Obsidian RPG in that regard.  Overall, I think Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a step back to a degree. I don't neccessarily not recommend it (but I can't write a mixed review yet...) but I really feel like its lacking in a lot of areas. The story can't be helped, though its still better than the first game, but a lot of this stuff could probably be fixed in an inevitable Enhanced Edition, which I feel like this game sorely needs. Its still a game worth its asking price, and if you are looking for a good co-op RPG, this is the best one out right now."

1011,Brainwave,173,132,16,February 24,Not Recommended,86.6,"I really wish that Steam allowed us to rate games on a 1-10 scale rather than a pure thumbs up, thumbs down rating. I spent a lot of hours on this game, but I didn't finish it.  To me that's the ultimate cut off, if I grow tired of a game before actually completing it, I'm giving it a thumbs down.  I enjoyed Divinity 1 (and played the original Divine Divinity) so expected to like this game.  There were some improvements over Divinity 1.  The inventory system is more streamlined, you can look at all of your character's inventories in one big screen instead of having to swap between characters.  In addition, you can use an item or equip an item with any character from any inventory.  I also somewhat liked the storylines of the pregenerated characters better than in Divinity 1.  But honestly, other than that, I liked the first game much better.  Both games have an issue (at least this is a problem for me - others might not be bothered as much by it) that if you go the ""wrong direction"" you end up facing enemies that are too hard.  In several areas you end up having to test out different battles to see if they are doable at your level.  I have mixed feelings about this - it makes levelling feel meaningful but something like this feels more in line with a dark souls game than more of a standard RPG.  I don't particularly enjoy having to go back and see if I can do a fight yet 3 or 4 different times as I level up.  But as to specifics about Divinity 2 - to touch on my last point, the areas felt really unbalanced.  As I mentioned already, you have to test out battles in some areas to see if you can do them yet,  In others, not so much.  For example, Act II for me was a constant situation of trying to find the one area I could actually make progress on, since everything else was too hard.  Then Act III wasn't a problem at all, I never ran into a fight I couldn't handle.  Then Act IV (and this is the point that I just lost interest) there's a part where you get ambushed in several different spots by monsters that are higher level than my level as well as the level of everything else in the area.  Keep in mind I'd been attempting to complete every quest along the way, so I should have been at least close to the highest level I could have been at by that point.  I was also playing on normal difficulty and have a lot of experience playing these kinds of games (I know how to use terrain, split party, etc..).  I also disliked the change in how skills work from Divinity 1 to Divinity 2.  Divinity 1 had a Novice/Adept/Master system for learning skills.  Once raised your skill level to a certain point you could learn a certain amount of skills from each tier.  The higher level skills also had level reqs and had long cooldowns.  Divinity 2 changes all of that.  Instead it uses source points which are kind of like non regenerating mana points.  Starting with the mid level skills, all of the powerful skills require source points to cast, some as many as 3 points.  From a RPG standpoint that does make sense that as a Sourcerer you would need Source points to cast skills - however as a game mechanic I found it to be really annoying.  After each combat you basically have to either travel back to a place where you can refill Source, or cast a spell multiple times with each character out of combat to regain these points so that you can keep using these skills.  *And* in many cases these are the exact same skills (Arrow Spray for example) from Divinity 1 that didn't require Source then and in fact were used by your characters in that game who were Source HUNTERS - so after even a bit of thought, the whole concept that they are Sourcerer skills kind of falls apart.  The Divinity games utilize elemental combinations to create effects (fire, freezing, electricity, etc..) in combat.  Divinity 1 did a good job of this but this is another area in which Divinity 2 changed things for the worse in my opinion.  Div 1 had a good amount of abilities that caused elemental effects but it wasn't everything and it was relatively controllable.  Div 2 has so much that quite literally after almost every combat the entire area is just a giant lake of cursed fire.  It's not so much that this is deadly it's just not as clean of a system as in 1 where you could set certain areas on fire in a more controlled way.  In that game for example, you could create an area where enemies would have to cross that would quite often significantly damage them before they got to you.  This game, perhaps because it's so easy to just set everything on fire, the actual fire damage doesn't really feel significant and really makes the whole thing kind of pointless.  This game also introduces Magical and Physical Armor to the health system.  Basically each character and enemy has a certain amount of Magical and/or Physical armor.  Most attacks are considered one or the other type and will hit that type of armor first before they will damage the health of the target.  There are two reasons why I found this system to really not be an improvement.  First, a standard party will have a mix of damage.  I had a tank/melee fighter, a ranger and 2 wizards.  The wizards did almost exclusively magic damage and the other 2 did almost exclusively physical damage.  Most enemies have both physical and magical armor.  This creates a situation where you are almost always having to knock out *both* types of armor on enemies, or you have to split your damage to 2 different enemies which means you can't focus down anyone very fast.  In addition to this, almost all secondary effects (knockdown, stun, charm. etc..) don't work at all until you've broken through the type of armor that blocks them.  This made those effects much less useful than in Divinity 1 where you could immediately crowd control someone in a tough battle.  In Divinity 2 since you have to break through the armor first, by the point where you could CC someone, it's often almost as easy to just finish them off.  Making that whole aspect of combat (which was a big part of the first game) much less useful.  In the end, I got tired of continually having to reload because I stumbled upon something thrown in my path that was too hard, bored by the inability to use skills without having to constantly refill my source points and just lost interest overall.  I'm sure plenty of other people who aren't bothered as much by these mechanics would enjoy this game, but it wasn't for me.  "

1045,JimmyWolf,731,2,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,95.8,"I'm 20 hours in, playing with the same friend I played all the way through Divinity: Original Sin with.  We love that we're back in this world. It's beautiful, exceptionally well crafted and an exciting experience.  Combat is even more expansive than before, mixing the ideas that were so successful in the first game (use of elemental surfaces and spells) with new ideas such as the addition of an armour system for both magic and physical damage. This is something of a double edged sword though, on the one hand the armour system makes combat a really interesting dynamic of carefully choosing opponents based on whether their magic or physical armour is higher, what resistances they have and so on, but outside of the combat, the armour system makes traps completely devoid of threat as their effects will not breach your naturally regenerating armour. Whereas in the first game suddenly being hit by a fire trap would send on a quick jump to your hotbar to prepare a Rain spell or healing, now you just walk on without an issue.  We've deliberately avoided choosing the characters with origin stories as we're looking to focus on the main story and avoid the party dynamics that the game has. These characters can leave if they dislike the choices you make, which I fully support as a choice by Larian, but it's something to bear in mind when building your party at the start.   One thing that definitely amazes me is the full voice-acting. Thats a huge amount of work, especially as the Narrator is fully voiced as well. Well done to Larian, that must have taken an enormous amount of work, but it really adds to the world and to the immersion.  The only thing we miss is the music from the first game. Larian cannot be blamed for this, as the composer for the first game passed away but his music was exceptional and an extremely high bar to match. The music this time round feels too quiet pretty much all the time even at full volume and if we find a mod that adds the music from the first game we'll be grabbing that as soon as possible.  So far, 9/10, the only issues being the music and gameplay niggles that sometimes break an otherwise amazingly immersive experience"
1046,JPŒõŒö,273,2,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,37.2,"First, let me say that this is my first Turn-based RPG ever. I did not expect this game to be as good as it is.  Right from the start, as you level up, you can feel that the levels matter and you actually need to level up if you want to proceed in the game. Same thing happens with your gear. You really need to find some better gear in order to win some battles.   The battles feel very challenging and therefore rewarding when you actually beat them. It feels good when you come up with a strategy and you win after countless of losses. (Experience may vary :D)  I like the characters. Every character seems to have a personality (even the animals!) and they seem well written. This is the first game I've played that has a narrator too! That's cool as he can really paint the picture for you because the characters don't really have good animations for every emotion or so in these top-down RPG's  Graphics look good for but I'd like a better antialiasing as MSAAx1 is not enough. Otherwise this game looks amazing. Lot's of cool places to discover and stunning vistas. The soundtrack is good too, the game lets you decide which type of music do you want to hear when you make your character. I recommend finding the soundtrack in YouTube and listening it.   I can't really think of cons because I don't have anything to complain (yet)."

Thes dev's of Divinity OSII, Larian Studios did not forget what gaming was and still is suppose to be.    I don't know if resemblance was intentional but I can't help but think of a few games that this game reminds me of however, often I don't hold it to that and because I just want to play Diviniy II, as Divinity II. I wont describe it (being the games it resembles and the game itself) because I feel that takes away from the spectacular creation that is Divinity Original Sin II, after all. the creators have no doubt been influenced, but in the best ways ever possible.  They took glorious ancient concepts and with a few unique features I've only see them do, and make it all their own. Plus it is a game you will have enjoyed 10 to 100 if not 1000 times more if you just go in.

There are so many different classes you can have and you're not limited in any way, you could be a rogue necromancer or a tank archer if you wanted.   I'm 60+ hours in and it has not gotten tedious or started to feel formulaic or repetitive, which is something that I've never seen happen in a long single player game either.  The side stories, environments and things you do are varied enough to feel fresh after 60+ hours, the sense of exploration and adventure never goes away.   Every time you level up or progress further in the story you are rewarded with new spells and abilities that keep expanding on the combat and allowing you to experiment and try new builds and tactics, which keeps you from falling into familiar combat patterns/habits and keeps you entertained.

Cons:   - ORIGINS, I don't like premade characters, if you choose lone wolf you skip a very big part of the game. - No Linux support. Seriously Larian? I needed to make a partition only to play the game. - Poor localization. I'm a native spanish speaker (I'm from Spain), for me english is not an issue but it is for my girlfriend...

Basically feels like going from Baldur's Gate 1 to 2 (though not quite, since that was continuing from low level to midrange and then to epic levels with the same narrative, and this is not that), since the new armor system involves you either taking advantage or PEELING off layers of armor before you can actually do things.  Positioning and elemental manipulation are somehow even more important this time around. Fortunately, a lot of the difficult encounters are not initiated until you finish a dialog, so one has plenty of time to position  the party as one sees fit.  The original one was an amazing game that I spent hundreds of hours on, but never actually finished. This so far  is shaping up to be an even more impressive experience that I will revisit over and over.   That being said, it is slightly disappointing that the premade dwarf character has extremely little relevance to the plot until the 4th act, and then it is tangential. Oh well."

Numerous improvements have been made since the last game (Divinity Original Sin). The Textures and animations are amazing. Also There seems to be a much more deep combo system compared to the last game which will make for some fantastic experamentation. Combat is still very interesting with most encounters resulting in different choices by the Enemy AI which ""spices"" up engagments.   Pros   The Characters and Dialoge are of course very good, with all of the origin characters having interesting backgrounds. your choices are questioned by your party memebers and many of them have different veiws, as they should.  The Skills and combos are fantastic and really fun to use although you will need to remember that your combos can be exploited or even used agaisnt you by the enemy Ai.  Armor and weapons look great and there seems to be a wide variety of different skins for each type of weapon.  While i did not explore the crafting system as much as i should have its pretty much the same as the last game. Although there are supposed to be way more (items etc) that we can craft.  The sound affects and the soundtrack are just as catchy and cool as last time. (GIVE ME THE SOUNDTRACK)  Cons.   Some enemy types have almost unfair adavantages against a party of any compsition, namley the undead and or necromancers/witches. Undead/ dark magic users, can both heal from poison and blood, as well as regular healing spells, which really just makes the battle alot longer than it needs to be. Ive never been a fan of undead being able to use the Hydro Healing spells. They should benfit from blood/poison fields/ spells only.  The Ui Still needs a bit of improvement as the item management system is still not that great. But is ok. It is very simplistic/minimalistic which is fine but we will need access to a universal chest of some sort to store our materials and such in. Or multiple backpacks will need to be equipped to carry most of your loot /items. Rather than turning one character into a pack mule or having lots of items spread out around multiple characters.      "

1096,Ridiculous Primate,17,2,0,"October 30, 2017",Recommended,276.4,"This game is one of my favorites of all time now. The world is immersive and beautiful.  The battles are challenging yet rewarding.  I played through it on Tactician mode  out of the gate because I beat the first game on Tactician mode and figured I'd master this in no time too.  The difficulty was surprising at times.  But one thing that I really liked about the difficulty was that it didn't rely on RNG for everything.  There are a few RNG elements, but for the most part the fights are designed to be beaten by strategy and predicting what the enemies would do. The over arching story was pretty classic, but what made me really love it was the companion stories.  They were really interesting and I really loved them.  Some people on here have commented that the companions don't interact much, and while I would have loved for them to interact more than they did, I feel like their stories cross over a lot.  For example Sebille and the Red Prince's stories straight up merge near the end if you are playing with them both in the party. I would suggest taking Lohse in your party too, because her personal quest is one of the best. I know there are still some bugs, and those can be frustrating. I know it uses some classic tropes, but classic tropes are classic for a reason.  Sometimes when you try  to reinvent the wheel you end up making a block of rock. The game also does successfully reinvent the wheel at a few points. I played it all through tactician mode and felt it was a good difficulty considering I took the hardest option.  If you are playing a game on the hardest setting you should expect to have to fight some fights multiple times to master them, and it makes me so happy that I never felt like I was just flipping a coin to win a fight.  Every decision in fights matters a lot. It's not a perfect game, but no game has ever been perfect.  This game is pretty damn good though, and if they fixed the broken quests and bugs I would put it in my top 5 RPGs instantly.  My major complaint about this game is that there isn't more of it.  I can't wait for some DLC."
1097,Atara Mos,174,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,147.3,"I had played the prior game and was encouraged to pick this game up in Beta because of the promise of having more than just one friend join you. In the Beta alone I have over 30 hours of play time, and we barely got out of the first area. That isn't a bad thing at all! That is a testament to the variety of ways that you can do things. We wanted to try all the different classes, the different racial traits, the different talents. The addition of a single talent can entirely change how the story plays out, which dramatically increases replayability. You're presented with multiple ways to resolve your quests, and each are different and can have influence on multiple aspects of your character. Despite the 30+ hours in beta I still found entirely new things in release.  The story is rich and deep because of how so much of your character influences different interactions and what you find along the way. The combat being turn based is a lot more thoughtful than just running up and bashing your strongest skill, you can truly use the environment to your advantage, or accidentally screw yourself over with it if you aren't careful.  It really harkens back to the classic rpgs of the past in such a great way.  My only real critique is that the learning curve is sort of steep to start, camera movement isn't the most intuitive and takes a bit to figure out the finessing of it, as the tutorial is minimal. This can lead to some funny interactions, though, as you figure out that maybe red outlined things aren't the best thing to click on with others around."

All the fights are so difficult that I have to save-scrub each of them multiple times; I can't imagine how hard playing this on the hardest difficulty is.  Super in-depth lore, lots of stuff to be engrossed inside. The world feels a lot like a less grim Path-of-Exile (you're sent to a prison island), which I like a lot.  I'm about to restart the game on the easiest difficulty. I'm not super into RTS or ""Strategy"" games, but I do like RPG's.

1115,StolenMadWolf,91,2,0,"September 10, 2017",Recommended,93.6,"Okay, this review is way overdue, but I wanted to take all the time I need to fully explore this game before getting it up. This proved more difficult than I hoped for a few different reasons and I‚Äôve decided just to take what I have got and get this review up now. Because this game deserves the praise. I did a review for the beta, and to be honest, not much can be changed from that previous one. But I will try and do a change up and update.  In DOS 2, you play as a Sourcer, an individual able to use a powerful magic known as Source. Unfortunately for you at the time of the game, said magic has some negative issues and you are persecuted and rounded up for 'curing'. Naturally, there is more to you then meets the eye, and your certainly not planning on sticking around for the 'cure'. This evolves into a deep and complex plot as you go on a quest not only to save the world, but to become the next divine, a form of demi-god. Only thing is, only one of four characters can be that.  Starting off with gameplay, first off, you have excellent roleplaying potential. You can select one of a few origin stories or create your own custom character, with their own origins, starting abilities and ‚Äòtags‚Äô, which offer additional dialogue options and opens up several possibilities in interactions. There are no classes in the game (the 'classes' you pick at the start of the game only really define your starting abilities, stats and maybe appearance.) which coupled with the simple, but very nicely done customisation system and wide range and freedom of dialogue lets you create the character you want to roleplay as in game. This is especially true with the ability to play the game you want to play it. Be a noble knight? Check. Be an anti-heroic rogue? Check. Kill every sucker in sight for the lols? Well, not everyone so you don't break the game, but check. Which leads me onto the combat. I love it. It's the good old fashioned slow-paced turn based gameplay that is so rarely used nowadays outside of some specific games. You can use basic attacks, abilities, consumables and magic to fight your way through your encounters, or, with a bit of luck, avoid them. You can utilise your abilities and the environment to create powerful combinations for attack and defence and there is a great deal of strategy and tactics to be had, encouraging you to think before you act. When you win a tough battle, you feel a sense of relief and of course, the feeling of being a badass.  Also, unlike many RPGs, especially amongst the older ones and the MMO's, the game is complex enough to make you think and to make you invest time into the game, but simple enough not to confuse you or tire you out and hence allow you to stay immersed. Few games can get that balance right.  Couple the roleplaying and combat together along with companions with different relationship values, and boom, you have the ideal combat roleplaying game ready to go. Even better though is the fact that whilst you can play the game solo, on your own or with a playable NPC party. You can also bring in three other players in on your campaign adventure with their own characters. The possibilities of cooperation, backstabbing, competition, friendship and the occasional bit of griefing or trolling with four human players is endless. All in all, by pure basic gameplay along, it‚Äôs utterly fantastic solo or with a group of friends.  There is a catch to this though‚Ä¶ this game can be insanely hard, at least initially. The enemy plays smart and can wipe the floor with you if you‚Äôre not careful. Once you start getting reasonable equipment, abilities and spells you start to find yourself increasingly able to slaughter your way through most of your opponents‚Ä¶ until you hit the bigger fights and the bosses, in which case, you promptly start getting your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•kicked, even on the lowest difficulty so be ready to save scum and rerun fights. Unfortunately, some quests and fights can feel just unfair at times regardless of where you are at, so be careful.  The campaign for DOS 2 is deep, complex and gripping, always encouraging you to continue playing through to the end. It has excellent characters and voice acting, coupled in with an unpredictable and well-done story with multiple endings with variations. It certain stands out as a solid campaign with numerous sub quests and side stories alongside the main one, couple this in with a natural inclination to explore the map, and you soon find yourself more than happily working to complete whatever you can find. The story‚Äôs one real weakness is that it suffers Halo 4 syndrome. Anyone familiar with the series will quickly get the gist of the plot, events and characters, whilst newcomers will be left scratching their heads as they try and get a better understanding of setting. Thankfully, a lot of this is covered as you progress through the game and you will soon get an understanding of the story and setting, which is solid enough to stand on its own two feet. The campaign is strong throughout Acts 1-3 but weakens in Act 4 due to some almost unfair and annoying quests, situations and fights, but the very final segment makes up for it.  I was able to complete the campaign on the easiest difficulty in about 40 hours, probably a little bit longer. You could do it quicker, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it if you want to have an easier time with fighting opponents. However, with multiple companions, replayability is definitely a thing with the game. I recommend playing the game at least three times. Once with your own character and three origin companions, once with the origin characters you didn‚Äôt pick and an previously used origin character of your choice and a third playthrough in Coop, so you get your money‚Äôs worth in the campaign by time alone.  Now, it‚Äôs not just the campaign. The developers went a step further and adding in a competitive multiplayer versus mode called arena, where you and other players fight each other alongside a custom campaign mode called Gamemaster, where you can play campaigns made by yourself or other players. Unfortunately, at the time of this review, games with random people are almost impossible in these modes and likely the campaign too. Every match is either full, empty or has one guy AFK, so in the end, I was only able to get one arena match in. It feels much like the regular campaign, but it‚Äôs a nice thought and addition. I wasn‚Äôt even able to go and play with Gamemaster at all. So you are going to need to organise with friends to full try that out. However, they are worthy additions which will add a few more hours to the game.  In addition, the art design, sound effects and the music deserve A*-grade damn rewards. This game is staggeringly beautiful to behold with excellent music through the different stages to immerse you into the world.  As a bonus, the game seems free of bugs and runs well on decent computers, even very low spec PCs and laptops have been able to run it, but be careful with the lower spec PCs. I did notice that as I progressed through the campaign, I did start getting performance drops, lag and even near crashes by the time I reached the last few hours of the game, luckily though, I suffered no crashes, though I came close on occasion. Just be warned.  All in all, Divinity Original Sin 2 is an utterly fantastic game that is worth every penny, even if you just play the campaign, you will get your money‚Äôs worth and it gets better with friends. If you are a fan of roleplay and strategy, and are willing to put up with the extremely difficult encounters, this game deserves a place in your library. The challenge and weaker Act 4 stops me from giving the game 10/10, but it still earns 9/10 and my own Wolfy seal of approval. I implore you to get this game. Trust me, you won‚Äôt regret it."

Sidequests are interesting, and exploring new locations is fun , although, almost all puzzles and exploration can be bypassed by teleportation spells.

Score : 9/10   The story is very well written set in a fascinating world where CHOICES MATTER. The sidequests are very diverse unlike most games that are filled with fetch quests.   The turn-based combat is very engaging as it rewards you for controlling the battlefield and keeping everyone alive (very important). Patience is key here to prepare setups and counter some status effects (magic and physical).  The early game is VERY tough, much like Xcom 2 where your gears are underleveled so killing enemies at this point is frustatingly difficult even at Classic Mode. Also, once you're done with 1 major area, you'll have to move to a different region so you can't return back to finish any incompleted tasks. So take your time and LEVEL UP!"

1144,Old Man Pizza Tony,124,2,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,127.4,"I have been playing this game since EA last year. Not religiously, mind you. But loading it up after just about every patch and playing Act 1 with my buddy. It has changed a lot since last December, and all of it for the better. I will mostly try to cover the changes since Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition, which I played through several times with a friend on Xbox One. I have not beat this game yet, and I probably won't for another 100+ hours. I am running multiple concurrent playthroughs with several friends and that takes an inordinate amount of time with how I play.  The tone of this game is not vastly different than the orignal, but it is different enough. No more vendors are yelling at you about cheese or entussling scrolls. The supporting cast is overall less goofy. You don't run into an obnoxious Goblin in the player housing and the new supporting cast is about 20x more interesting, despite the slightly more serious tone. The voice acting is stellar and a major surprise that it even happened at all, considering the vast amount of dialogue. Every character feels distinct and makes me want to talk to them. There are plenty of funny little dialogue throwbacks to weird little things that happened in the first game. From a talking skull in the very first area, a Dragon Commander character in Act 1, being scolded for looking for needles in haystacks, to references to Arhu in a random book 99% of players will never read. The narrator's voice is on point with inflection and appropriate humour for every dialogue option so far. I seriously cannot state how amazing the voice actors are in this game. There are just as many jokes and funny choices in this game as the first, neat sidequests, and funny names abound. They are just more in line with the slightly more serious tone of this game. The companions don't have absurd names like Bairdotr, but they are still colorful and interesting. They have their own goals and interact with the game world in very different ways.   Combat is infintely improved. High ground is decisive in victory, range combat is king, and making pure physical/magic builds is necessary for CC'ing high level enemies. No more RNG exists for crowd controlling enemies. It is based on depletable magical and physical armor. The armor values do not regenerate without special skills, but if you are making a solid build, there are ways to replenish this. The AI is smarter and know to avoid retribution builds, to target high DPS weak characters, and path around ground hazards. They pull neat tricks that only a player would have done in DoS:1. They set up combos turns in advance and enemy parties have really good synergy. Despite all this, the combat feels fair. They work within the confines of the game and the skills are very well explained. If you find your build is lackluster, that is fine, respeccing is free and readily available in Act 2. The build diversity is insane. Splashing for utility is extremely viable and necessary. Pure builds work in almost all encounters. I love the fact that everything but Rogue is usable. Memory is a huge cahnge, you can learn every single skill that your stats allow, but cannot put them on your bar unless you have enough memory slots to learn the skills. This does restrict how many spells you can use at once, but it is also balanced and the whole game is built around it. this is not a bad change, but it is a major one.  The biggest and best change is the removal of crafting as a skill. Anyone can utilize materials found without having to waste valuable points. Stealing art is still a valuable way to make money. I don't know how anyone could even play this game without a dedicated thief character. The game is not Skyrim, you simply cannot do everything in one playthrough. So many choices will fully lock you out of dialogue trees or quests. Not in a restrictive way, but in a lore-friendsly and realistic way.   If you want an RPG that has stellar combat, engaging dialogue, and love lots of reading, this game is for you. This game is not for everyone, and just because it wasn't made for you, does not mean this game is not a masterpiece."

Unlimited replayability, I've restarted at least 10-15 times now without finishing the game just because I figure something out, or I want to try something else.  Not because what I'm doing is getting stale, but rather that I'm just so curious about different outcomes that I'm compelled to go look at the alternative.   The multiplayer hop in/hop out style is super easy to learn, and I've already started working with the game master mode.  As a DnD GM, I can see the potential of divinity's game master mode, but I can tell it will take some learning and getting use to.

I hope you choke on me!"" giving my lizard prince a curse. I couldn't stop laughing...  There is a lot of humor in this game that is on purpose and a ton that is seemingly accidental. The writing is great and the stories are enthralling. I find myself wanting to complete side quests to find out what happens rather than simply squeezing that last bit of XP. Half the time I walk around after a quest is already completed just to see if there are any additional clues as to why somebody did something.  So far I am really enjoying this game.  =============== Downsides: - There are a lot of bugs. I have found a lot of situations where I have to reload the game. For example; a battle where I can't loot a corpse (the arachnid in the graveyard).  - More bugs. I discovered that the reason I couldn't target enemies in the Driftwood arena was because I wan't zoomed in enough. After I realized this I was able to beat the competition.  - Even more bugs (getting access to a waypoint early because I was on a cliff overlooking it, which allowed me to fast-travel to the waypoint and expedite my storyline).

If you play for tactical combat, you'll love it. If you play RPGs for an engaging story and world, you'll love it. If you love tinkering with builds and different class comps, you'll love it. If you love reactivity, freedom, and choice and consequence - you will love it.  If you think you might possibly enjoy this game - buy it, you will not regret it. This is the best RPG since Witcher 3."

1193,Freewinds,246,2,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,266.5,"Completed act 1 three times now, and have just completed the game.  For me, the first 2 acts were really great. Lots to explore, fun battles and many choices to make, all of which felt like they were important. Character creation and leveling was great fun, as could build however you wanted. I really didnt like my character at the start and was thinking about restarting, but after I started getting gear that improved my other scores, and let me learn spells from other schools of magic I started to really love it, in the end having a Elementalist Staff wielder, making for great moments of being able to summon ice storms and lazor beams.  However, it all goes downhill near the end. Arx is where the final act takes place, and looks very promising at first. That is until you have to spend many many hours searching for anything to move your quests along, or spoil it all by looking at a walkthrough.   (Spoilers!) I think many will agree with me that finding Arhu is the hardest part in the game, not because its a good puzzle, but because you get so little infomation to go on. Gave up so many times, and ended up just killing people to try and find any clues, such as the toymaker, which I was trying to avoid. Hopefully they change the final act and make it easier to find clues. The final battle for me was rather anticlimatic as well, after which I had to make a choice. It was all very abrupt, and just well, happened, not much of a build up or anything. Others may have found it better than me though.  All in all, a very good game until the final act, and one I would still advice playing. "
1194,Psytric,191,2,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,44.2,"An absolutely stellar game.  One of the best cRPGs in years, with, in my opinion, the best combat system ever.  Pros: - Excellent writing - Great voice-acting - Absolutely spectactular combat  - Huge variation in character development - Multiple ways to accomplish just about any task - Tons of hidden gems secreted away throughout your journeys - A number of innovative systems, like the Physical/Magical armor system, companions whose class you can choose when they join your party, and many others - Great coop experience - Well executed battlefield construction - high ground, cover are very important concepts to utilize in combat with serious bonuses - Fantastic AI - Enemies and friends alike don't blunder through dangerous terrain, enemies use battlefield to great effect.  They will be your primary teachers as you learn how to fight. - Very pretty  Cons: - Huge character variability inevitably leads to steep learning curves for some encounters - Similarly variety will make you want to reroll and start over several times until you're happy with a party - AoE and surface generation can make it difficult to use classic magic user strategy. Friendly AoE generally owns party members as much as enemies - Some matchups can be brutal depending on your composition - Is your party mostly magic/poison damage?  Better hope you don't face undead...  Have mostly melee champs?  Those archers are going to ruin you... - Still a number of bugs, though mostly not gamebreaking and fixes are actively being worked on by Larian Studios  All in all,  you can't go wrong with this one.  Just an absolutely wonderful game, a real ""holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•it's 4am"" experience that will infiltrate your dreams and daydreams."

Assuming you are not already familiar with the franchise, you might come across games media these days and be like ""what is this game and why does such an oldschool looking game peak at 86000 players on Steam?"" - well, the answer is so simple that I actually refuse to write a proper review for this game:   it is a an epic piece of art and a masterpiece of an rpg game.   Divinity: Original Sin 2 is on a level of quality and brilliance that only very few game studios have achieved so far. My respect to the belgian developers of Larian Studios, who are an amazing example of a studio crowdfunding games to deliver the best experience they possibly could.

It kept me busy for a good couple weeks, and entertained me the whole time. The combat system is entertaining, if a bit challenging, and the world is large and fun to explore, packed with secrets and quests. There are so many choices when picking a character. In general, the game offers lots of choices, but there are so many character combinations it's almost hard to decide what you want to do, so you just make a few characters and play the game twice. It also has great modding community, and all it's other modes are solid as well. It does suffer from some issues though. The UI needs a bit of work, some areas are laggy, some hitboxes are confusing, and the journal sometimes doesn't provide enough information. It's not a perfect game. However, it is relatively new. GIve it time, and I guarantee, all these minor issues will be fixed. The only real issue I have with the game is the ending. You get your final battle and all, but in the end, all that happens is that you hear about what happened to everyone after the events of the game, and some of it sounds like fun, to be honest. All in all, this is a solid gaming experience and a must play for any fan of the RPG genre. It is worth the price."

Pros: +++++Free complete respecs are available any time after act 1. Allows you a lot of room to experiment and discover what builds are the best/most fun. +++Same great combat, build customization, and RPG experience from DOS1EE ++Lonewolf is back ++Race/preset lore choices on character creation ++Amazing mutliplayer support, up to 4 players ++PVP made more easy and fun though the declare war and online arena system ++Tons of flavor and unique items. Several kinds of items i have never seen in another RPG +All the classes/builds are viable just like in DOS1 +New source point system tries to control spells that trivialize the game +Great flavor and level design +A classic soundtrack +Open your game to the world and let people join or join random games +Difficulty settings range from ""wow are they even trying to hurt me"" to ""this fight will take multiple hours to figure out and clear"" +Many new races/enemy types +Memory system prevents you from having to manage 3 full spell bars and makes characters feel more unique/specialized compared to the party.  Mixed/preference:  +/-Game is significantly harder than DOS1EE +/-Some of the more broken spells and abilities have been removed +/-CC has been massively nerfed +/-Crafting has also been nerfed, but all crafting can be done from level 1 +/-Stealing has been slightly nerfed, now after you steal you have to portal away for a few min to let the heat die down.   Cons: -Source point controls are easily bypassed, but are also cumbersomely attached to abilities are are needed to do basic things out of combat, like bless. The game also disincentivises experimenting with new abilities if they have source point costs, because you have to refill the source points after. Some abilities are attached to source points that are clearly not good enough to warrant the source point cost, and the ability will never be used. -some people report lots of bugs, but I have done many playthroughs and have not encountered anything that I could not resolve in-game -cant dye your outfits anymore -with the new system, tons of things have been removed. No more weapon or armor modification except poisoning and adding runes.  --No orcs (c'mon man wtf) ---Parties with split damage types (magic/physical) are heavily penalized by the new armor system. Biggest gripe by far. If your party is split 2-2 the game will be much harder. If you have 3 physical damage and 1 magic damage, the magic damage hero will often feel like it isnt contributing much to the encounters unless it is summon/support.   Overall the game is absolutely amazing. I may have a lot of cons on that list, but just like a spouse, its easy to nit-pick the flaws  of something you love so much. Additionally, I am comparing the release version of DOS2 to the EE version of DOS1. I strongly encourage anyone who likes RPGs or is interested in a more classic/hardcore RPG experience.

Score : 9/10   The story is very well written set in a fascinating world where CHOICES MATTER. The sidequests are very diverse unlike most games that are filled with fetch quests.   The turn-based combat is very engaging as it rewards you for controlling the battlefield and keeping everyone alive (very important). Patience is key here to prepare setups and counter some status effects (magic and physical).  The early game is VERY tough, much like Xcom 2 where your gears are underleveled so killing enemies at this point is frustatingly difficult even at Classic Mode. Also, once you're done with 1 major area, you'll have to move to a different region so you can't return back to finish any incompleted tasks. So take your time and LEVEL UP!"

Pros: + Amazing gameplay; well improved over Original Sin 1 with quite a few extra mechanics + Delicious graphics; well suited for the genre  + Story is improved compared to the previous game + Interesting characters; especially your companions (rolled with Fane, Sebille and The Red Prince) + Content-heavy; can find quests and interesting things in every corner of the map + Great co-op (up to 4 players); loads of fun when playing with friends, works very well + Good price/hours ratio, especially if you include replayability and multiplayer  Cons: - Very weird difficulty curve; had a tougher time with battles in Act 2 than the final boss. - Some battles are totally not fun; [VERY MILD SPOILERS] who ever designed the Scarecrow battle should be whipped in the public square - Game is sometimes very cheesy; prepare to cheese it from time to time in order to compensate - Some side-quests seem to be cut short; development seemed rushed in some areas - Minor bugs and balance issues (some have been patched at the time of writing the review)  Overall, a solid sequel to the original Original Sin (heh).

1265,jenn_geoffroy,182,2,0,October 2,Recommended,245.1,"I play RPGs for the story. I play strategy games for the tactical puzzles. In RPGs, the combat is (at best) an okay distraction between story points, and if there's a role-playing way to avoid a fight, I'll usually take it. In strategy games, the story is a thin trope-ridden veneer I mostly ignore.  Then along comes the DOS games. The only RPGs with a story I really really WANT to finish, alongside fights I will make a detour to take on. I'll still avoid fights with persuasion and roleplaying when I can, because I like the immersion and playing a clever character, but in DOS2, I'll loop back after obtaining my objective, plant as many barrels of oil and ooze I can find next to the enemy I conned into letting me run around, and then light them up like a roman candle before taking them down.  There's some good funny moments. Some gory creepy moments. Some really really hard moments (yikes, the crucial reveal in Lohse's story GUTTED me - it even gutted the hard-case who was guiding me on that quest, that's saying something as to how heartwrenching a choice needs to be made). And there's moments when you finally kill someone who's been irritating you for awhile by turning him into a chicken before giving him a final whack and shouting IN YOUR FACE as he explodes or something. Ahhh, good times, good times....  (Edited to remove potential light spoiler from Lohse's quest, never know...)"

It has an amazing story and rewarding turn-based combat. Sidequests are interesting, and exploring new locations is fun , although, almost all puzzles and exploration can be bypassed by teleportation spells.

The first two acts are amazing, then the next two seem like they needed to ship product. I'd complain if i hadn't spent (guessing) 40 hours on the first two acts which are totally worth the money.  Yes the ending is terrible (I literally got an ending scene that i did not pick, yes several plot lines were not finished, yes there are more secret levers in act 4 than believable, yes the last fight is one which it's a totally valid not doing it and just watching the youtube.  That said, i recommend.  I assume the new version of the game has fixed these issues or at least the big ones, but as the old saves were incompatible and i was just into act 3, i didn't restart to find out."
1270,Draenei For Life (Josh),239,2,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,105.4,"GAME OF THE YEAR FOR ME. ALSO if you play this game keep the black cat alive, trust me its so worth it.   SO the good things about this game: The story/writing has vastly been improved saince the first game, I loved the first one but the story never really pulled me in, this one however pulls me in within the first hour. The combat is still as fun and tactical as the first, with far more combinations of spells and abilities (plus waaayyy more spells, classes and abilities in general). The character creation is fun, its not too long and crazy but allows you to make (or customize an existing character) to be the character you wanna play. The companions are all detailed with decent stories and they all have different impacts on the storyline and each other. Gamemaster Mode is incredible fun, it feels like the D&D campaign creator I've always wanted. This game has up to 4 player multiplayer for the full game, so if you have the friends jump into this with them.   Few neutral things: The music is kind of average, a few fun tunes but feels generic. The crafting system is no longer a cluster of confusing rubbish, so its not a negative, it still doesn't feel very important though, on my solo playthrough and playthrough with friend we both ignore it as it feels still not that useful. Arena mode is a rare giggle but feels kind of incomplete. While its very true many quests allow you to do them  in different ways which is fab, some of them matter little, you will be given like 5 options (if you find them all) to finish a certain part however, you can just run back and do the other options for extra xp for killing them (as I do) making the choice slightly pointless.  Bad things for me (or things I think others will hate): The amount of races is fun (including undead versions), however, it feels like every race is here in vast quantities, no race feels rarer. If you do not like turn based combat this game is NOT FOR YOU AT ALL. Your characters pathing when you tell them to go someone in a fight will still decide to  casually run through fire/poison etc, or sometimes attacks of opportunity make ZERO sense. Gamemaster Mode has no way of making character talk, its all up to the GM. Now this last comment is something that just personally annoys me, but when you need to  help a character in a fight (or save them) they have this tendency to just go full in and take huge quantities of damage, they seem to have dumb AI compared to actual enemies.  I hope my review gave some insight on whether to purchase this game."
1271,Toastmold,197,2,0,"September 22, 2017",Recommended,188.4,I think it is excellent. Great writing and some nice turn-based combat. More polished than previous Divinity games. A fair bit of replayability.

1274,[EU] DeliveryBoi,325,2,0,July 26,Recommended,156.6,"I consider this the game of the year 2017.  The gaming industry has been lacking super high-quality AAA games that simply tried to create the best possible game in its respective genre - without trying hard to cash-grab and overly cut costs where you really shouldnt. The reception of Witcher 3 simply showed how starved consumers are for such quality-games.  Divinity Original Sin 2...  The game looks absolutely gorgeous. Stunning islands, stunning characters, amazing colors - a feast for the eye.  The universe the developers created is interesting and overall excellent and suits the genre perfectly by adding that extra touch of insanity and therefore supporting player-choices which, quite frankly, are going to be insane more often than not.  The ""R"" in RPG? Delivered.  Replayability - The game often delivers a lot of significant choices how you can influence the world around you and a ton of ways to solve (or terribly mess up) the things you encounter.  Innovation - Modding-support needs to be counted for this one. You can create adventures, mod the base game and even have a complete game-master mode. Features like crafting are an interesting touch for such a game, but can be entirely ignored if youre not into that. Spoiler, if you havent watched the trailer yet:  You can speak with animals, if you pick a trait for that. That's absolutely incredible. Animals simply connect to us on a whole different level. Who wouldnt be touched by some poor, sad puppy eyes, even if its just a game?  The ground-effect based combat is also a nice touch with several connections to that.  The game is fully voiced and even has a narrator. If you really listen closely you can hear that not every voice actor was perfect, but come on, the game is fully voiced and I'm really nitpicky here. Can't hire the best voice actors for a thousand characters and have all of them perform on the same level.  I've got to criticise though that the multiplayer does not have a multiplayer-dialogue function. What I mean by that is that the first player who clicks on the NPC gets to do all the talking without the input of the others. Sure, you can punch each other in Teamspeak and start complaining about choices, but that's no fun. There's a PvP function in the game, but I dont really feel like that's the thing I'd like end up with when I start up a >Coop< session. There should be something like dice-rolls and whoever gets the highest rng, gets to say his line. Something like SWOTOR?.   TL;DR The game offers serious bang for the buck and I'd struggle if you asked me for more recent games of such high quality."
1275,Jaxim,329,2,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,154.0,"I've been pretty burned out on gaming for a few years now, and I've constantly been searching for games that can give me the sense of joy and wonder that I used to feel. At some point it just started feeling like I had done it all before, and very few games truly felt unique or inspired to me.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now on the top of a small list of games that have really reminded me what it's like to have fun playing a video game.  Also, this game has made it seriously hard to justify the $60 price tag on almost any AAA game over the past several years, at least for me."
1276,Tesla_Foxx,106,2,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,16.1,"If you're a fan of classic RPG style gaming (I.e. Baulders Gate, Diablo, D&D, etc.) then this will be your salvation from the lack of major titles in the genre. It stays true to its table top roots while also giving a stylish spin to everything we've had to use our imagination for over the years. The combat is fast paced and tactical. Everything is a weapon, including the environment. It really comes down to what you have available to you and what you can think up with each situation. The story is well written and engaging. It keeps you hooked to see how your particular play through pans out in the grand scheme of the world. Plus the mulitplayer support adds a lot of fun and interesting ideas to the mix. Such as your companions (either real people or a.i.) will each view the quests differently and have different motives and reasoning for every action. Sometimes things work out, other times you end in a bloody brawl after a quest choice turns sour. Each adventure breathes a wealth of choices and possibilities. Don't forget the game master mode either! Being able to create your own adventures for your friends, or anyone for that matter, to battle through is worth the price in itself. There will always be new content to play or create to keep this game going for ages. PVP is also included to add that pinch of competition outside of your main campaign that turns into a explosive game of wits before you know it. All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone seeking adventure or a little more ""choice"" out of their game. Have fun solo or with friends as you fight to replace the divine that the world has lost. May your blades and mind be sharp!"

The difficulty of battle and the thought that goes into strategy of it all is incredible, although i am biased since i am a huge fan of turn based fights. Can be a bit infuriating at first since most fights you'll get into at first will pretty much destroy you until you get a handle on how it all works.  All in all its a lot to take in at first and that can be discouraging, but pushing through and spending time playing the game and before you know it you'll be enjoying this game more then you thought you would."

Lots to explore, fun battles and many choices to make, all of which felt like they were important. Character creation and leveling was great fun, as could build however you wanted. I really didnt like my character at the start and was thinking about restarting, but after I started getting gear that improved my other scores, and let me learn spells from other schools of magic I started to really love it, in the end having a Elementalist Staff wielder, making for great moments of being able to summon ice storms and lazor beams.  However, it all goes downhill near the end. Arx is where the final act takes place, and looks very promising at first. That is until you have to spend many many hours searching for anything to move your quests along, or spoil it all by looking at a walkthrough.   (Spoilers!) I think many will agree with me that finding Arhu is the hardest part in the game, not because its a good puzzle, but because you get so little infomation to go on. Gave up so many times, and ended up just killing people to try and find any clues, such as the toymaker, which I was trying to avoid. Hopefully they change the final act and make it easier to find clues. The final battle for me was rather anticlimatic as well, after which I had to make a choice. It was all very abrupt, and just well, happened, not much of a build up or anything. Others may have found it better than me though.  All in all, a very good game until the final act, and one I would still advice playing. "
1287,Psytric,191,2,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,44.2,"An absolutely stellar game.  One of the best cRPGs in years, with, in my opinion, the best combat system ever.  Pros: - Excellent writing - Great voice-acting - Absolutely spectactular combat  - Huge variation in character development - Multiple ways to accomplish just about any task - Tons of hidden gems secreted away throughout your journeys - A number of innovative systems, like the Physical/Magical armor system, companions whose class you can choose when they join your party, and many others - Great coop experience - Well executed battlefield construction - high ground, cover are very important concepts to utilize in combat with serious bonuses - Fantastic AI - Enemies and friends alike don't blunder through dangerous terrain, enemies use battlefield to great effect.  They will be your primary teachers as you learn how to fight. - Very pretty  Cons: - Huge character variability inevitably leads to steep learning curves for some encounters - Similarly variety will make you want to reroll and start over several times until you're happy with a party - AoE and surface generation can make it difficult to use classic magic user strategy. Friendly AoE generally owns party members as much as enemies - Some matchups can be brutal depending on your composition - Is your party mostly magic/poison damage?  Better hope you don't face undead...  Have mostly melee champs?  Those archers are going to ruin you... - Still a number of bugs, though mostly not gamebreaking and fixes are actively being worked on by Larian Studios  All in all,  you can't go wrong with this one.  Just an absolutely wonderful game, a real ""holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•it's 4am"" experience that will infiltrate your dreams and daydreams."

The last ~50% of the game (act3-5) sure seem a bit rushed. The magic of the first 2 acts is not entirely gone but fades until the game becomes from time to time slightly annoying in act 5.

All the fights are so difficult that I have to save-scrub each of them multiple times; I can't imagine how hard playing this on the hardest difficulty is.  Super in-depth lore, lots of stuff to be engrossed inside. The world feels a lot like a less grim Path-of-Exile (you're sent to a prison island), which I like a lot.  I'm about to restart the game on the easiest difficulty. I'm not super into RTS or ""Strategy"" games, but I do like RPG's.

1316,Uglzorp,"3,153",2,0,February 11,Recommended,203.1,"Top-notch sequel that improves upon the first game in every way. The game is still incredibly open-ended and allows for all sorts of emergent gameplay. The writing is better, with more developed companions and a more layered story. Combat is deeper, with the addition of physical and magic armor that prevent you from immediately CCing enemies at the start of a fight. Now you have to carefully choose who to focus down first while considering your own defenses. On Tactician difficulty, the AI is good at picking targets and countering your moves so you definitely need to think two steps ahead. Elevation is a significant factor in combat as well, with ranged attack damage, range and line of sight being affected. There's also a much wider variety of enemies and spells/abilities, along with an expanded crafting system. Finally, the game is huge. It's about twice as big as the first game and there's no filler. Every quest, combat encounter and dungeon is carefully crafted and rewarding to play.   The only flaw is the UI. Managing your inventory is pretty cumbersome. Part of the problem is that the game is technically playable with a single character and each character in the party is treated as a solo player, so there's no shared inventory. When you're trading with a merchant, you can only access one character's inventory at a time, making it difficult to compare item stats. Trading prices are also affected by character-specific traits, so you'll need to first move the items you want to sell to the character who will get the best prices. Also, the game doesn't do a good job of explaining the many status effects. Some are self-explanatory, like Bleeding or Burning. Others, like Suffocating or Deaf, are not. Basically, the only way to learn what these do is to apply them or have them applied in combat. Larian should learn from Obsidian here and provide tooltip explanations anywhere you see status effects mentioned.  Overall, a fantastic game that would be even better with a few UI improvements."

1322,Gergg,663,2,0,"September 8, 2017",Recommended,72.3,"An incredible game that promises to be even more amazing when it launches next week.  The combat really stands head-and-shoulders above other classic RPGs like Tyranny and Pillars of Eternity. So few RPGs of any type really manage to make it feel like what skill or spell you're using really matters. In D:OS2 even weak skills and spells can find their place in combat if they can create an advantage. Even the weakest fire spell can turn the tides if the enemy is standing in oil.  Let me share some fun moments with the AI.  I thought I could bamboozle the enemy by giving my main character the Zombie trait. This trait allows them to heal when poisoned but take damage from healing spells/skills/potions. I foolishly assumed that they wouldn't be able to take advantage of that but if anything it made my life harder. So many AI enemies have a basic ranged healing spell/skill, some of which will restore health over several turns. They were all too happy to use them on my character.  At some other point, I was flirting with a woman who was part of a band of thugs. We got along well and promised to meet up in the future. Shortly after that I‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•off her boss by insisting that he free my elven kin. In the ensuing battle the woman I had wooed fought against her compatriots in order to help me. She burned alive in the fray and I vowed to take her diary with me for the rest of my days.  In another encounter I was well positioned to stave off the enemy with my tank. The enemy mage saw this and cast a spell on him that swapped his position with a caged demon. I had to spend precious turns bashing the cage door open to escape while my squishy mages scattered.  The game is packed with these kinds of fun moments and turns and those were all within the first couple hours of play. Larian took what already worked in D:OS, improved it, and then fixed a lot of what didn't work. I have no idea how the co-op is but I imagine it will be excellent."

My biggest Con:  - Substantial UI Changes from Divinity: Original Sin that may take some time to get used to. It doesn't always feel like the most natural or intuitive system.  My biggest Pro:  + The storytelling between different characters/companions is always unique. Dialogue options make a difference in how they interact with you, and how the entire game unfolds.   I also love the new classes and spells they've added since Original Sin I.  This game has come a long way from when I first purchased it in Early Access. Back then it already felt like a full game and a fascinating environment that I would be happy to spend hours in, and yet the development team continues to update and polish their game.

I've got to say that this game is one of the best for its price range, there's so much content in this game its crazy and its all voice acted :DD. Larian studio's really out did themselves with this game, if I had completed every single possible side quest/content before the main story finishes we are looking into 150hours plus (on honour mode which I play) or 100 hours plus on any other difficulty whilst reading dialogue etc.. This game is best played with friends as the character interactions/dialogue is top notch and provide really fun role playing. However I played by myself as I wanted to get immersed and finish the game on the hardest difficulty due feelings of it being rushed if I played with more people.   it took me 52 hours to complete the game doing story mission only with 1 origin character story (Lohse completed) as well as critical side quests that are blocking my way to the main quest. I'm also playing on Honour Mode difficulty(if your whole party dies you save is wiped), basically I have to play very safe ( I died quarter way in the game, salty af).   This game is worth every penny and its price tag just beats some of AAA games on global top sellers on steam for content/replayability to price ratio.

Numerous improvements have been made since the last game (Divinity Original Sin). The Textures and animations are amazing. Also There seems to be a much more deep combo system compared to the last game which will make for some fantastic experamentation. Combat is still very interesting with most encounters resulting in different choices by the Enemy AI which ""spices"" up engagments.   Pros   The Characters and Dialoge are of course very good, with all of the origin characters having interesting backgrounds. your choices are questioned by your party memebers and many of them have different veiws, as they should.  The Skills and combos are fantastic and really fun to use although you will need to remember that your combos can be exploited or even used agaisnt you by the enemy Ai.  Armor and weapons look great and there seems to be a wide variety of different skins for each type of weapon.  While i did not explore the crafting system as much as i should have its pretty much the same as the last game. Although there are supposed to be way more (items etc) that we can craft.  The sound affects and the soundtrack are just as catchy and cool as last time. (GIVE ME THE SOUNDTRACK)  Cons.   Some enemy types have almost unfair adavantages against a party of any compsition, namley the undead and or necromancers/witches. Undead/ dark magic users, can both heal from poison and blood, as well as regular healing spells, which really just makes the battle alot longer than it needs to be. Ive never been a fan of undead being able to use the Hydro Healing spells. They should benfit from blood/poison fields/ spells only.  The Ui Still needs a bit of improvement as the item management system is still not that great. But is ok. It is very simplistic/minimalistic which is fine but we will need access to a universal chest of some sort to store our materials and such in. Or multiple backpacks will need to be equipped to carry most of your loot /items. Rather than turning one character into a pack mule or having lots of items spread out around multiple characters.      "

1348,Owning Duck,73,2,0,"November 2, 2017",Recommended,361.4,"This game is now my most favorite game, I played DOS twice, one playthrough by myself (150 hours) and one with my friend (60 hours). I can say that I really enjoyed the first game and was really looking forward to DOS 2. I'm almost 200 hours into it and I am not even done with the campaign. But being nearly done I think I can give a proper review.  Combat: So most people criticize the game for being turn-based rather than a real-time with pause function. But it feels right in place as the combat still feels so engaging. The combat is tougher since a lot of skills that you have, the enemies have as well. This makes the combat harder but also more rewarding once you get past it. The game is hard yet fair. There are fights that seem impossible but the game provides us with the tools to win or hides the tools within the world. A lot of the skills feel strong and useful. But towards the end game, I find that magic damage started to be more obsolete as it is much faster and easier to physical as that it the most reliable way to damage. Though that might be because my team consisted of 3 physical dealers and one wizard.  Story: This is by far my favorite part of the game. The story is rather simple yet done in a way that makes it compelling. And as someone who played the other Divinity games, there are a lot of surprising plot twists that I was surprised by. But where the game shines the most is the origin stories. You can either create your own character or choose one of 6 pre-made origin characters that have their own backgrounds. And and these stories are very well-written with equally well made characters. It is so interesting to see how much the game changes because of who you are. If you didn't pick an origin character, you can still recruit them but after a certain point, they will become unavaible. It is a rather intersting thing of being a side character to the origin character's stories though. And each origin chracter will have a personal quest which will result in some drastic endings. But some advice, do not play as Lohse. Not because she is bad, she is a great character with a one of my favorite stories. But Lohse is best when played as a companion and her personal ending yields the best reward a video game has ever given.  UI: I will be blunt about it, it's bad. Inventory management is a nightmare. Sadly it is also required in powering up your weapons in the end game. You will spend a long time in your inventory looking through it to find a single item. Crafting can be done through a seperate menu but most of the time you will be combing random stuff together and that is horrible. In the end game, you will have so much clutter mostly involving books and paper with no swift and reliable way to dispose of them.   Other Notes: The game has quite alot of bugs as well. The first area will be rather polished because it was in early access for a long time. But the game is large and some parts are even broken at times. But I would like to say that I have not faced a bug bad enough to take away from my enjoyment. The game is best played (in my opinion) with a roll with it attitude. Just accept mistakes that happen. It is really fun to see all my mistakes bite me in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•later down the line. And before I forget, the soundtrack. It is a masterpiece. DOS 2 has a different composer from the past Divinity games (RIP Kirill) but the new composer has truly put his heart and soul into it and it is an absolute joy to listen to.   Just buy the game. Larian deserves all of the praise and hopefully they will make a console version so we all can share in the masterpiece that is Divinity Original Sin."

There are a few RNG elements, but for the most part the fights are designed to be beaten by strategy and predicting what the enemies would do. The over arching story was pretty classic, but what made me really love it was the companion stories.  They were really interesting and I really loved them.  Some people on here have commented that the companions don't interact much, and while I would have loved for them to interact more than they did, I feel like their stories cross over a lot.  For example Sebille and the Red Prince's stories straight up merge near the end if you are playing with them both in the party. I would suggest taking Lohse in your party too, because her personal quest is one of the best. I know there are still some bugs, and those can be frustrating. I know it uses some classic tropes, but classic tropes are classic for a reason.  Sometimes when you try  to reinvent the wheel you end up making a block of rock. The game also does successfully reinvent the wheel at a few points. I played it all through tactician mode and felt it was a good difficulty considering I took the hardest option.  If you are playing a game on the hardest setting you should expect to have to fight some fights multiple times to master them, and it makes me so happy that I never felt like I was just flipping a coin to win a fight.  Every decision in fights matters a lot. It's not a perfect game, but no game has ever been perfect.  This game is pretty damn good though, and if they fixed the broken quests and bugs I would put it in my top 5 RPGs instantly.  My major complaint about this game is that there isn't more of it.  I can't wait for some DLC."
1354,Atara Mos,174,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,147.3,"I had played the prior game and was encouraged to pick this game up in Beta because of the promise of having more than just one friend join you. In the Beta alone I have over 30 hours of play time, and we barely got out of the first area. That isn't a bad thing at all! That is a testament to the variety of ways that you can do things. We wanted to try all the different classes, the different racial traits, the different talents. The addition of a single talent can entirely change how the story plays out, which dramatically increases replayability. You're presented with multiple ways to resolve your quests, and each are different and can have influence on multiple aspects of your character. Despite the 30+ hours in beta I still found entirely new things in release.  The story is rich and deep because of how so much of your character influences different interactions and what you find along the way. The combat being turn based is a lot more thoughtful than just running up and bashing your strongest skill, you can truly use the environment to your advantage, or accidentally screw yourself over with it if you aren't careful.  It really harkens back to the classic rpgs of the past in such a great way.  My only real critique is that the learning curve is sort of steep to start, camera movement isn't the most intuitive and takes a bit to figure out the finessing of it, as the tutorial is minimal. This can lead to some funny interactions, though, as you figure out that maybe red outlined things aren't the best thing to click on with others around."
1355,No Name Salted Butter,156,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,62.7,"Easily one of the best RPG's ever made.  To me it has a feel similar to the fable titles with the freedom you get (within reason) during a dungeon and dragons session.   The combat is tactical and challenging while also rewarding, the characters are interesting, the world is beautiful and fleshed out, and overall the game once it was fully released is polished and well worth the wait and money put into it.   The game master mode is also a welcomed addition, only adds to value of the game."

1357,Mahebra,291,2,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,238.5,"Improves on the original in every way.  Original Sin 1 was probably one of the best CRPGs I had ever played to that date, and I could find little to no flaws with it, many of which were improved upon in the Enhanced Edition of the game.   Original Sin 2 somehow manages to take that mastercraft and make it even better, the new systems and mechanics implemented in such a way that I find it almost hard to return to the original. I have spent an absurd amount of time on the Early Access alone, and cannot believe the amount of variety and feasability to the different ways to approach each situation.   I was a bit taken back by the new changes to the armor system -- having physical and/or magical armor protects you (and your enemies) from those CC abilities, which made the first game a bit of a race to CC the enemies before they could do it to you. Original Sin 2 found a interesting way to handle that, and building your team and skillset to tackle this new problem has made the combat far more interesting and more satisfying, while not over complicating things. Instead of a party make-up being almost required, you're now a bit more free to experiment with your set up, and the changes to the skill system allows you to experiment more with being a hybrid build, instead of having to take a strict path in order to maximize gains.  This game seems far more friendly to newer players, while still keeping much of the spice and charm that I've come to expect and love from Larian, and this newest entry has done nothing but please and delight me."
1358,loved london in 1666,46,2,1,"October 25, 2017",Recommended,86.6,"So honestly i pirated this game for the first time, just to see it, I tried lots and lots of these type of games strategies and so. I could never get into it, it just never catch me, I've heard a lot of good reviews of this game but still not enough to risk and buy game i never loved genre of. So I pirated it and just fell in love in the first second. I clicked on the skull and hearrd my character  react, almost on everything, almost every single one. It took like few minutes I explored very first room, than I deleted illegal version and bought it. First I want to say that difficulty system is quiet‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you have the first one, which is for completely noobs like me, but when I learnt some and wanted more competitive gameplay, the next difficulty was too hard, of course for people who had experience in genre. In other ways, the game is amazing, almost all quests you have TONS of possibilities to complete it, or to fail it, or to... avoid it? And when you understand it, in your very first hour, it wakes your curiousity, you start seeking every corner for gameplay pieces, dialogues, you start fast-saving to see all ways of conversations. I am wasting hours in this game, reading all books, my own journal, and still into it. The story is actually very obivious and classic for fantasy. If you read mass fantasy books, movies etc the story will be extremely predictable and boring, but that doesnt make game boring cause of reasons I mentioned above. By playing this game I learnt basics of this genre, and enjoyed already 20 with some hours and ready for much much more. Of course this game has big potention because of simple replayability, and mod support.  Overall I can rate this game on few fields: Story: 5/10 - It is REALLY typical, but still it has good telling Graphics: 7/10 - I know texture quality is not the first criteria rating strategy games, but still it is not very bad, but unlikely most cool texture quality games it looks really beautiful, bright and contrast perfectly balanced. It adds a big load of atmosphere. Gameplay: 10/10 - Basicly not because of this step-by-step, this gameplay actually never different a lot from other games in the genre, because of the variaty and the high quality in every single second in your gameplay, and you will see it, just as you jump in the game.  Buy it, really, you are wasting your time watching reviews or pirating just like i did."

1371,Andy Dwyer,656,2,0,"November 9, 2017",Recommended,74.5,"Probably the longest review I have ever written or will ever write, unless Original Sin 3 comes soon, SO, TL:DR; This has become my favorite game of all time. It's the best CRPG I've played since the old school ones, and then adds more mechanics and better story telling.   Pros: -Elemental Interactions -Companions so good I had a hard time picking who to bring in my party -Fun combat and mechanics -Excellent puzzle design for Acts I and II, and just really really good puzzle design in Act III.  -Compelling storyline, that ties in neatly with the other Divinity games, without requiring you to play them (though you should) -No microtransactions, season pass, loot boxes, etc.  -Able to respec your character as much as you want -Excellent skill management system -Excellent crafting systems -Excellent visuals in regard to spell effects and great art design -Excellent RPG elements, relative to character creation, talents, skills and tags -The music is off the charts for the most part -Great voice acting and sound design -Choices that actually matter during the story and change the story -Oddly descriptive ""intamacy"" scenes if you romance a character (is that a pro, maybe, it was well written) -Difficult enought that I was challenged and died plenty on the second highest difficulty, but never felt frustrated enough to quit or scum the game -Excellent game, because there's no other word I can use to describe it.   Cons: -Had a crashing issue during a few of the cut scenes between Acts -Music repeats a lot if you're repeatedly getting in and out of combat -Items like arrows and grenades get auto added to your hot bar, and I constantly had to clean it out for skills to be in the order I want, playing as a polymorph character I had a lot of skills appearing and disappearing between combat  Overall, you should play this game if you like turn based CRPGs, RPGs in general, turn based games, good games or even if you just want to support a great indie game dev. It reminded me of Dark Souls 1, where when I finished my first playthrough, I instantly made a new character, and started to play again with a completely different play style.  Update: you should also nominate and vote for this game whenever possible, so it can get some well deserved praise."

I've also not made it past Fort Joy (the beginning right after the tutorial) yet as ive repeatedly restarted, playing around with different builds and such. But i am having a fantastic time with it. i havent enjoyed an RPG so much since Dragon Age Origins, nor have i wanted to smash my screen so much since initially discovering the Dark Souls games. I havent really played the first even though i own it so im not sure how it compares but i just might have to go play though it after this one.  Thank God for autosave, whether it be trying to survive an underground fight club at level 2-3 or dying to teleporting crocodiles, it has come in handy many times already.  I cant comment on the storyline so much yet as i havent really gotten into it yet but the origin stories seem interesting and custimization (even for origin characters) is fantastic.   In short if you enjoy RPG's and dont want to button smash your way to victory but actually use some strategy than this game is for you. You get a real feeling of accomplishment when you finally beat those ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• teleporting crocodiles after 30-45 mins and 5-6 reloads.  Oh and graphics/optimization seem to be pretty great too, am running on max settings with no lag nor have come across any bugs as of yet although i still have a ways to go obviously.

But as soon as I wake up, I find that all my stuff is stolen. There's 5 guys in my room that I don't know. Suprised I ask the lizard lady what's going on, she says she's sorry, but this is a setup.  I get angry, you can't fool me, you can't set me up! Naked and without any weapons I attack the robbers, and I kill them all, taking the weapons of their body to finish of the rest, and using my magic to dish out even more damage. In the end, they all drop dead and I'm victorious. I talk to the lizard lady to ask what just happened, she admits they tried to rob me. The smooth-talker I am decide to forgive her, and say it was worth it for the night I had. She liked what I said, I continue talking to her, we end up having another sexy night.

Far better than any other games I've played.  You get to know each character of your group and every actions you make WILL impact future quests.  I could talk hours and hours about that magnificient game, but I don't have time for that. I'd rather play this over and over and over again.  The Soundtrack is amazing, and after playing 80hrs, listening to any song brings nostalgia. Each time I log back on this game, I wish I havn't played it already to revive this awesome story.  If you play the game like it should be played and you actually care for the dialogs, which are f**cking awesome btw, there's between 60/80 hours of play time ahead.  11/10.

Basically feels like going from Baldur's Gate 1 to 2 (though not quite, since that was continuing from low level to midrange and then to epic levels with the same narrative, and this is not that), since the new armor system involves you either taking advantage or PEELING off layers of armor before you can actually do things.  Positioning and elemental manipulation are somehow even more important this time around. Fortunately, a lot of the difficult encounters are not initiated until you finish a dialog, so one has plenty of time to position  the party as one sees fit.  The original one was an amazing game that I spent hundreds of hours on, but never actually finished. This so far  is shaping up to be an even more impressive experience that I will revisit over and over.   That being said, it is slightly disappointing that the premade dwarf character has extremely little relevance to the plot until the 4th act, and then it is tangential. Oh well."

I begrudgingly bought it, largely out of principle, having heard of it being brilliant and that it was independently developed and published, thinking that I might not like it or give up on it. But I didn't, and now i'm here telling you to buy it.  I started the game up and thought it felt too slow, too cumbersome and somewhat bloated, with just the first area taking near enough half an hour to an hour to fully explore and understand what's going on. It got even worse when I got to the next area. ""god this drags on"" I was thinking, ""when's the proper fighting and loot fest stuff gonna happen?"" I thought. In hindsight, I definitely didn't understand the pace of the game and the focus of it at all. After having put in over 50 hours I can now say that this game, for what i've played, is a masterpiece.   It shares similarities with games like diablo or torchlight, but with mechanics and design choices that make you consider every little move you make, this game manages to scratch at more and more layers of depth and forces you to explore options you wouldn't otherwise if not for the firm but fair difficulty. The AI is clever. It doesnt just bash at you with anything/everything, it picks and chooses what it needs to do to take you down. It picks off the weak, avoids the strong and weakens the immovable by using the environment and the creatures therein to it's advantage. For instance, there is a skill in the game that let's you kill an enemy if your character dies. Having cast this, the enemy's allies, themselves unaffected by this skill, will avoid killing your character but WILL proceed to weaken and immobilise you so that when it wears off they can take you down. They work things like this out and have clear strategic formations you need to counter.  It's one of the most rewarding experiences: coming into a fight fully unprepared, as the underdog, only to walk out the other side the victor. You know it was because YOU made the critical choices needed to win that battle against the odds and against a genuinely THINKING cpu opponent. It's fantastic.  The way the game feels to play when you're fully invested is unparralleled. There is an absolute deluge of content if you seek to complete it all and the way the game gives you utter freedom to do whatever you want/need/can do is both daunting and refreshing at the same time. The difficulty is fine tuned to perfection, where small mistakes can be cleverly worked around but rushing can easily get you killed.   Take your time, learn the ropes and think about each and every move as if it's your last, that's when the game is at it's best.    BUY IT"

Everything that is great and wonderful about character driven RPGs is here and fleshed out,  I believe I've finally found the game that will let me retire from reinstalling Neverwinter Nights again for good. The only thing I wish they had done is let you roam the entire world like in Original Sin; the chapters are separate areas. They provide ample warning before you leave an area though, so it's not like it's a frustrating mechanic!  There have been complaints about the difficulty of not only the combat but also in solving the puzzles; If you're struggling to solve a puzzle it's because you haven't found all the clues; they're always there somewhere. if you can't beat a particular enemy because he's too strong you're gonna have to come back to him later. The game won't coddle you, you're supposed to learn how to defeat different enemy combinations through hard work and experimentation! The game is equal parts merciless and forgiving, enlightening and mystifying, challenging and fun.   A must-buy, and above all else; we must have a sequel, Larian!  The holiday is over, get back to work developer slaves!"

Fully co-opable story for up to 4 people. Game Master DND-esque mode for designing and playing your own adventures with a group of friends (4+). Editor for mods and making new areas (and mod support via workshop).  I don't normally get sucked into RPGs and their stories, but this one is special. Larian Studios has poured love into it, and it shows. There is also no unnecessary DRM. This is a game that shows (like The Witcher 3) that DRM doesn't need to happen if the content is unquestionably consumer-favored."

More Larian goodness, this time with a more gripping initial 15 hours. The writing and quest design is impeccable once again, or even better. There is real weight to this game, you can't help but be fascinated by this game world. It is a feeling I can only compare to that I had with Dark souls 3 recently.

1421,Diesel,342,2,0,"August 26, 2017",Recommended,167.2,"I have played Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition, It has to be one of the best games I have ever played in terms of provided content, coop, exploration and level of adaotation required in many of the opponents you encounter.  Despite Early Access being limited with content release, voice overs, maps and skills, the game has still successfully impressed me, there are so many variable options that allow you to make the story fit to your playstyle, you can so choose to go about quests however you choose....i.e if you need a key to save someone, you can pickpocket the person who has said key, instead of follow through with their demands.....and similar like things, combat is fantastic, the reconstruction of the AP system is amazing and works brilliantly, the way you memorise skills for fights and have the option to use any  combination of weapons you want is also a really nice touch. I personally find that the start can be very off-putting to players perhaps seeking a more casual playthrough, simply because good gear at the start is hard to find and it takes many hours to sift through enough quests and objectives and even area's just to progress to a stage where you feel ""comfortable"".   The only bad point that comes to mind after playing just under 30hrs, is that combat seems to be heavily based on a need to be the same or higher level than your opponent, I have found that despite having fairly good gear, if an opponent is even 1 level infront of me, the battle is very challanging and any hits you land seem to do very little damage...where as if I return, being the same level with the same gear, I can breeze through them, I am unsure if this is just early access stuff or the way they have chosen to go about combat.  Overall, I recommend both, they are extremely fun with friends and fit a varying style of game types like a mix of rpg and rts, stealth...all out, magic, melee, archery. And I enjoy that the game is not a straight line, sometimes you have to turn back and find the right gear, or adapt how you enter combat or return with skills that counter the enemies. If you made it this far....I only write reviews for games Im extremely impressed at...so for me - 10/10"

Best when playing with another player (up to 3 additional players). Tons of lore, story, and ways to deal with most situations. Lots of freedom in how you want to play the game.   Downside is that combat isn't as frequent and leveling does tend to be on the slower side. You'll spend more time gearing up or chatting than doing anything else. Enemies, in general, are on the weaker side, so sometimes combat doesn't feel as rewarding.   Fun moments: -Trying to break into the ship's kitchen ends with the entire ship blowing up. -Battling asssassins in one motel room, while listening to npcs in another room talk about their love life.  -The moment my cousin and I realize the food we've been eating was made of the local law enforcement that continues to go missing.  -The moment my cousin and I realize what the gods were planning leading to a an epic betrayal of all betrayals.  -Failing to save a family from an execution leading to all out war in the oil fields.  -Realizing the badguys at the end had a very reasonable endgame to their scheme that would have led to the best kind of ending you could get in the game.  -Having my cousin backstab me as I attempt to take Divinity for myself (I won't forget this cuz. I hope you enjoy all those arrows in your face.).   Overall the experience was enjoyable. I cannot wait for a sequel to this game."
1431,YagDridge,191,2,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,32.8,"This game is a true gem. I really enjoyed Divinity: Original Sin but it had many flaws that made my playstyles limited difficulty wise. In this game all those minor/big issues I had with the series is gone.  One of my favorite things about this game is all the dialog options and more are available depending on your race, and tags. The random things you can do and play with your own style to pass are just amazing and leave me with a complete immersive feeling at all times. I'm still in the tutorial zone at nearly 9 hours because im taking it nice and slow while reading all that dialog. A somewhat early review but I've already noticed ALL my nitpicks from the first game have been addressed in this game.  Major improvements that I love from the last game: + More Dialog choices + Recruiting any new member gives you the choice to select their class allowing for a party of your choice as well + Selling an item worth a lot of money gives you quick reputation with traders + Killing someone in town away from everyone doesn't make the entire world hate you in this game + New Classes/Undead! + Very informative tutorial + New armor/movement/combat system that feels perfected for turn based + Inventory enhancements making it really easy to deal with all party members quickly + Co-op + 4 Players + Crafting"
1432,Lobster Dominance Hierarchy,30,2,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,364.3,"Great game! The Larian team has done it again. I'm happy for them, especially considering the studios history when they were taken advantage of in the past. I particularly like the shout outs and throwbacks to the DOS1, and I'm no where near done the game yet. If you are wanting a role playing strategy game where you actually interact with your companions, and who have their own motives/goals then this is the game for you.  Pros: - More skills. Dear God the old game was lacking in skill variety, really noticable late game. Good to see they improved this. - Diologue is great! - Lore is great! - Deatail in game world - Humor, and a at times snarky narrator - Different ways of solving a quest  Pro/Con: - Graphicks are amazing as ever, but lag the heck out of your computer when you are in the forest/city and not in a building - Crafting is more streamlined but waaaay harder when experimenting as it's less straightforward as DOS1. Good/bad I don't know.  Cons: - Still a little bugy/brocken quests. Nothing too serious as there is ushally a work around. But I came accross my first broken quest bug in Act 2, as in no way to start it as item didn't appear in inventory. Also the game sometimes crashes, so be sure to save often, especially if you open up a new window to google something.  So there you have it a great game, and dare I say if the studio waited a month to release the game to fix these bugs the game may have even been called immaculate? Hope it gets some more patches soon!  EDIT: A little deeper into the game and a little saltier at some of the bugs, *cough* tarquin *cough* as I found a few more broken quest bugs. This game is definitely released a month too early. Still a great game... just waiting on some more patches..."

1446,Tyrvali,91,2,0,"May 15, 2017",Recommended,201.8," Divinity: Original Sin 2  So, Divinity: Original Sin 2...  I have to say several things about this game before I properly review it. 1) It's in early access alpha at the time of review. 2) Only Act 1 is available, alongside an Arena mode. 3) I loved Divinity: Original Sin  Ok, so, for people who loved the first one, this is a must buy. Even at its current stage of development, which Larian Studios are constantly working on and updating, this is amazing. I have played through the first act as several different characters.  Each playthrough has been similar and different in unique ways. For example, I tried to playthrough the game as a solo Elf Cleric.  The Voidworm fight was nearly impossible for me . I then tried a proper playthrough, using a full party. My character was a Dwarf Rogue. Not only are the classes and races completely different, the combinations of combat were entirely different and I loved it.  I will not lie, however. To people who A) haven't played Divinity: Original Sin, it could be hard to get used to, despite the tutorial help boxes. B) Some elements of the story can break. For example, if Gavin dies before making it back to the camp, you cannot progress in his quest. Note: This is not a game-breaker.  Overall: Since I loved the original, I purchased this game early into its alpha. So far, I've loved every minute. I can't wait for the full release of this masterpiece. Thank you, Larian Studios!  UPDATE: With the full release of the game, I am extremely excited to keep playing. Starting an undead elf character was the first thing I did. I am almost done with Act 1 at the moment and have discovered so many quests, characters and items I previously had no idea about. There are so many things to do and many quests to complete. The cinematics and introductions are a nice touch."

1458,Hitch,25,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,102.8,"I purchased, but didn't log a ton of hours in the remastered first iteration of this game (36 hrs), but this 2nd one just feels right, and it's a homerun for Larian. I will start by saying I have only experienced the co-op of this game, which so far has been a load of fun to play with a good friend:   Areas to highlight:  The story telling is vastly improved, with exceptional voice dialogue (gaming industry wise). There are a ridiuclous amount of options for dialogue depending on your characters skills and tags. Rich orchestra sounds bring you back to some of your favorite RPGs of old. The game is gorgeous too, graphics are superb. Scenes are incredibly detailed, from brightly lit beach environments to dark, dreary dungeons. The mood is dark and sombre overall but clever writing adds in humor all along the way. HUD is intuitive and nothing new, co-op shared backpack screen is something to behold; very convenient. The combat is intuitive but high on difficulty, Larian does not hold your hand in this one. There are major things in the game that are not obvious which I won't spoil, and without the internet you'd miss a lot. Highly recommend playing without reading up on the game, it makes for a much better/realer experience. Those new to this type of game will repeat battles many times over on the harder difficulties. This is Turn-Based though, at it's best. Re-trying is half the fun, learning from your previous mistakes becomes essential. Winning a battle on the first go after using perfect tactics really feels satisfying.  Areas for Improvement:  We encountered minor bugs, a learned spell that wouldn't show up in the mage book, finishing a successful dialogue with a creature then clicking them again by accident only to have new dialogue that leads to a fight. Stuff that requires a reload but isn't game breaking, and occurs infrequently. The environment manipulation is incredible, and no other game has allowed players to control fights so well using it, however it becomes a bit too much at times with the blood, water and other puddles--often making magic-type characters useless since every attack hurts your friends and foes alike. Source spells are a great idea but would be nice to be able to use once per battle or game day. Current game makes it hard to accumulate source points for skills that truthfully really arent as impressively OP as they should be at that rarity. Lastly, the gold/bartering system needs a hotfix bad. You need to move a slider to hit exact gold value on both sides, without an option to go up by 1 or type in a value. This is a basic that has been overlooked.   Summary:  I look forward to logging many more hours before updating this review (so far at around 30 hrs). Recommended for anyone who loves old-school (or new) cRPGs or any 1-4 group of friends looking for a great game to co-op, just note it requires much focus, dialogue/reading and chatting, so I wouldn't recommend playing with a stranger. Also be prepared for 4 hr+ play times. It is almost impossible to make any progress in 1-2 hr playings. Congrats to Larian on a job well done, it's been one of the better RPG games I have played in years.  I would score D:OS2 9/10."
1459,pH. mmSNAKE,372,2,0,May 21,Recommended,362.6,"Good part of a year passed before I decided to write this up. I have been playing since release but I haven't felt I played the game enough for reasons I'll outline. This is a crpg developed by Larian, sequal to Divinity Original Sin. Overall this sort of title is specific, however if you like rpg games like this, the kind that take long hours to beat, have extensive skill mechanics and build possibilities then look no further, the game delivers in spades.  The overall gameplay format is that you control up to four characters.  You move and explore in real time, but combat is turn based. Much like Divinity Original Sin. However there are important mechanics that change the game up a lot. First every piece of gear will have armor it provides. There are two kinds of armor, physical and magic. While you have armor value you are immune to almost every CC effect spells and skills can do to you, once that armor is depleated your HP will take damage and you will be succeptible to crowd controlling effects. This goes naturally for enemies as well. So the tactical portion of this combat relies around you managing armor of enemies and stopping them from getting a turn if you can. Sure eventually you can build your character/s that you outright kill anything that moves in a turn, however, majority of the game this will not be the case.  Combat in general is fairly involved. You have MANY skills to choose from, considerably more than last game. Each of the 'schools' have ineractions which may not be straight forward. Warfare school boosts ALL physical damage, that includes any and all spells which deal physical damage (like necromancy, reactive armor, polymorph etc). You have your basic attributes, you have talents and you have your non combat civil abilities and racial benefits. Everything you pick will affect how you play and solve problems. Civil abilities offer you a huge variety in how to solve problems. Stealing items, persuading people, sneaking around, being better at bartering and so forth. Most quests usually have multiple ways to tackle them. Don't have any lockpicks or keys for a door? Blow it up. You can't persuade a guy to give you an item? Steal it, or kill him and take it off his corpse. And so forth. While it isn't as diverse and brazen as say Fallout 2, it still offers a good variety of things you can do and how you go about it. Even the origin tags like Scholar, Outlaw or Mystic will benefit you to solve some quests. Most things in this game have some sort of purpose. Being undead means poison heals you, but healing magic hurts you, it also may have poor response from people when you talk to them without a mask or helm.  Now you can play either solo or co-op. I played mostly co-op, until I decided to have a solo campaign much later. When you create a character you can create an unique generic no background character OR you can pick one of the six scripted origin characters. Those characters have their own quest lines (along the main one) and they are recognised in the world. They have more interaction and give overall a better more diverse and interactive experience than if you just play with custom characters. My first co-op game we all made a custom character. That was a mistake. Custom character has one good boon though and that it gets an unique ability called Dome of Protection, and that skill is incredibly useful for majority of the game. Other than that if you don't pick origin characters you miss a lot of interaction with some of the best quests in the game.   Story wise the base main story is average. It's your standard ""i need to become a god to save the world"" quest. Some silly twists along the way but nothing really deviates from this. However interacting with the world and doing various side quests that give the game character is where its strengths lie. It isn't as well fleshed out as say Witcher 3, but it's pretty close. Your experience also may depend on the companions you pick, you may not like some but may love others, as the ones you don't pick won't be present much in the game. Also don't worry about missing the story with the first game. There are only a few amount of cameos. Mostly the game is very far apart.  Pacing and Balance? Well this is where the game hits a snag a bit. Pacing is off. Act 1 is difficult because you don't have many skills to work with and it feels like a LONG tutorial. Act 2 is absolutely massive, consists of bulk of the game, and it's easily the game's strongest point. Act 3 then deviates from the whole experience by being extremely short, in general lacking substance, quests and just‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to do and explore. Act 4 to me was great because it was finale for many storylines you started even in act 1, plus most of the fights in this act are damn fun, both because you grew nearly crazy in power and because opponents you face are on the level you expect them to be.  Balance wise well depends. If you are the kind of person who will sit down and learn the ins and outs of the game you will probably CRUSH this game once you get a grasp of your builds. Difficulty in first act and some of the second act is mostly due to lacking options and source skills, but once you start getting source skills you can build some obscenely powerful character. To me that's fine...this is a game where you are trying to ascend to godhood afterall. Just be warned, some builds are absolutely disgusting how powerful they are, if you look them up or figure it out. There are also various I would say exploits. Where due to how transition from real time into turn based can be abused, as well as some skills that just take advantage of the AI. Still there is plenty of tactical thinking, but once you start getting up in the levels and you know what you are doing, tactics will be replaced with you leaving mutilated corpses and craters behind you.  Is it worth the money? Abolutely. I bought this game on full price and haven't regreted it one second. It is much like Witcher 3, where you have a ton of content and plenty of replayability. This game is LONG so take that into consideration. It's fairly normal for your campaign to last you 70-100 hours if not more, especially if playing with others. Be aware that in august Larian will be releasing Definitive Edition, which will be a separate entry in steam BUT if you own this game before it is released you will get it for free (much like Enhanced Edition with previous game). The new edition will be adding lots of new content including rework of Act 3 (which to me is a big plus) as well as balncing changes and so forth. If you are tight on time and know you won't have a chance to play more than one campaign in  a long amount of time, then you might consider waiting until august to play but you might buy it now or on discount (since you will get DE anyway). If you like these sorts of games, chances are this will bring a huge smile to your face and you will end up enjoying it, solo or with other people. Larian created a superior sequal, in many ways. I eagerly wait to see their future efforts."

The freedom to do whatever and the ""hidden"" things you can make or counteract various parts of the game make it really fun to just keep messing with. Like crafting nails with boots to make shoes that are slip proof (ice), I had no idea it would even work like that but the novelty of figuring that one out was fantastic!  This game gives you the flexibility to kill anyone, and I mean anyone. You might pay for it if you aren't high enough level to attack them but you still have the chance to ink out a victory from dire straits.   The conversations are rich and your dialogue can actually have a meaningful impact on your game.   I would highly encourage to play coop with your friends, its a load of fun!

It is obvious that the developers of this game have put in their hearts to making a game that best suits the wants of a community of tired gamers who just wanted the freedom to make decisions, to customize their gameplay, and have a fully immersive story all along the way. Not only that, but this game will introduce you to new and interesting game mechanics that are both a pleasure to play with and against. When things go wrong in the game, you can't help but laugh it off because you are fully aware that your faults lay in your own mistakes or lack of understanding about certain core mechanics. However frustrated you may get at something or upset with yourself for having made some mistake, the game is interesting and engaging enough to motivate you to try again and learn from your mistakes. This game is definitely a must buy for any rpg lover.  If there is one thing I can hope to see in the future, it is official DLC. I would love to experience new classes, new abilities, new gear, and new stories. It would be nice to have a playthrough of the ""enemy's"" side since even many of the enemies can be misunderstood or mislead. Also, a story revolving around the races that aren't present in this game could make for more gameplay and story without taking away from the existing one. Finally, more emphasis on the cooking/crafting system would be warranted. As it stands, crafting is not very important as you can find everything that is craftable and more. One of the only important recipes you need to know: Shoes + Nails = saved lives."

THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.  I haven't completed the game yet, but from what I have seen it is definitely my new favorite game of all time. The amount of fun that I have with this game reminds me of when I first picked up Dragon Age Origins. You can create any type of character you want and even change it later if you aren't happen with your choices. The game doesn't really hold your hand, which is nice, and there are many ways to strategize a battle -- use your imagination! If you have a character that is sneaking around you can initiate combat with your other characters and have that sneaky character get into position before engaging.   The crafty is really tricky in the sense that it doesn't really help you. You can pick up books that give you recipes, but if you don't find any books you wont know how to make certain things. There are guides online to help in this regard, however. The amount of things you can craft is seemingly endless. Dozens of spells are craft only spells!  Try a playthrough by yourself to get your bearings, or jump into a game with a guide and have them show you the ropes. The game is best with friends, but it still enjoyable by yourself.  There are bugs, but it is to be expected. Updates are quick and the developer actually listens to the players.  8.5/10"

1488,Diesel,342,2,0,"August 26, 2017",Recommended,167.2,"I have played Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition, It has to be one of the best games I have ever played in terms of provided content, coop, exploration and level of adaotation required in many of the opponents you encounter.  Despite Early Access being limited with content release, voice overs, maps and skills, the game has still successfully impressed me, there are so many variable options that allow you to make the story fit to your playstyle, you can so choose to go about quests however you choose....i.e if you need a key to save someone, you can pickpocket the person who has said key, instead of follow through with their demands.....and similar like things, combat is fantastic, the reconstruction of the AP system is amazing and works brilliantly, the way you memorise skills for fights and have the option to use any  combination of weapons you want is also a really nice touch. I personally find that the start can be very off-putting to players perhaps seeking a more casual playthrough, simply because good gear at the start is hard to find and it takes many hours to sift through enough quests and objectives and even area's just to progress to a stage where you feel ""comfortable"".   The only bad point that comes to mind after playing just under 30hrs, is that combat seems to be heavily based on a need to be the same or higher level than your opponent, I have found that despite having fairly good gear, if an opponent is even 1 level infront of me, the battle is very challanging and any hits you land seem to do very little damage...where as if I return, being the same level with the same gear, I can breeze through them, I am unsure if this is just early access stuff or the way they have chosen to go about combat.  Overall, I recommend both, they are extremely fun with friends and fit a varying style of game types like a mix of rpg and rts, stealth...all out, magic, melee, archery. And I enjoy that the game is not a straight line, sometimes you have to turn back and find the right gear, or adapt how you enter combat or return with skills that counter the enemies. If you made it this far....I only write reviews for games Im extremely impressed at...so for me - 10/10"

The combat is engrossing, satisfying, and keeps you talking. You are encourged to work together and experiment, and the massive freedom of choice in the game means you'll never know what someone is going to get your party into. However, that same freedom can also mean that you aren't always clear on the ""right"" way to go, so you might spend some time exploring or consulting guides. You can always make your own path if you want to though.   There were a few odd bugs. One of my friends was having issues with his inventory just dissapearing. Reloads didn't fix it and he was unable to use any items. During combat, things aren't always crystal clear on what you can hit and what is in range, so sometimes you just have to wing it. It usually works out though. Not many complaints from me on this one, it'll go down as one of my fondest multiplayer experiences ever. Thanks to the devs for giving me great times with my friends."

It has all the strenghts of the first game`s Enhanced Edition, offers turn-based combat and plenty elemental interactions (make it rain, aoe stun through blitz bolt - create a fire surface, throw poison onto it for a huge explosion etc.). You can play with up to four party members and can either create your own character or take one of the four (after full release six) pre-made characters. While the first game lacked in the story, this 2nd part is much better in this regard. It has a much darker tone and so far the story delivers fully. It is grim, entertaining and really complex. Also the possibility of party dialogue and getting different results when talking with different party members to certain NPCs enlagerns its richness in this regard. But the strogest point of Divinity Origial Sin has always been its combat system. And the second part adds more features to that and makes everything even better. You now have aroumr fore physical and magic damage, which you have to break first in order to inflict status elements like stunned or burning or knocked down. Also there is a height system now, that your ranged characters can use for greater range and more damage.  And last but not least the game has after the full release on the 14th of September a Game Master Mode. There you can basically develop and play your own adventures with the Divinity engine and UI. With this you can create your own D&D - campaign and play it with your friends.  Another small feature is the Arena Mode, where you can explore the combat system with pre-defined characters on several maps. All this features offer easy access to multiplayer, I have atm ver 250 hours into this already great game and multiplayer worked fine every time. I regard Divinity Original Sin 2 in the highest order. This game was highly enjoyable already in its year in Early Access although it missed some of its features.

We can also choose between the races of Human, Lizard, Elves, Dwarfs and, my personal favorite, the Undead; whatever you choose, rest assured that even just your race will have an effect on how you're viewed and treated in the world of D:OS 2.  On top of all of this, Larian has even dared to go completely beyond the conventional by implementing a fully-fledged Game Master Mode -- a feature which to me is extremely interesting, allowing up to five players to enjoy customly created campaigns as a group of up to four adventurers and one Game Master, to create the virtual equivalent of the good old Pen & Paper roleplaying experience.

I haven't ever really reviewed a game before, so I'm going to give it my best shot. This game is about as close to DND on a digital medium that you can get while still being its own game. Fully interactive environment, (tons of fire, electricuting water, exploding oil and poison) and the developers really played with it.  Just a small spoiler alert, but to just put it in perspective how the environment comes into play. There's one fight pretty far into the game on top of a mountain of wreckage. Out of absolutely nowhere, tons of oily blobs come to kill you. Every time you damage them, and they move, they spread oil. So the whole time, you're trying to batter them down as you move up the mountain to get away from them. The dev's then have it to where when the oily guys finally go down, TONS of fire guys show up and ignite all the oil. I know its kinda hard to get it across, but fighting ontop of this giant mound with fire everywhere trying to batter down the fiery slimes, seriously felt cool.   Character creation wise, I mean it's pretty good. Not a ton of customization, just standard face 1, 2, 3, etc. But honestly not a big deal. As you develop what your character is good at, you grow to love em.  Classes are pointless, you build your character the way YOU want to, so they can literally become anything. I've got a few characters going, and all feel super unique and diverse. A dwarven rogue shapeshifter who can grow a tentacle arm and smack people around as well as shed all enemies magical resistances to support, I've got a fire slinging geomancer who uses oil‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to explode just about everyone, and I've got a necromancer archer who summons tons of undead corpses to explode all over people. It all feels super unique and fun to play. There's times where I miss my other characters, hop on them to play, and then miss the one I was just playing. Kinda neat.  If you want my advice, 100+ hours advice, PLAY WITH FRIENDS. Preferrably in person. Hit up an old school lan party feel, bring cpu's over, build a SUPER diverse cast of characters, and hunker down. Pizza and beer obviously. Plan for an all nighter, because I literally PROMISE you you'll be playing til 6am EASY. I haven't personally had a game grab me like that in many years, and god damn its a good feeling to have back. Go larian, you guys are the men and women making games great again.  10/10."

1515,Alariq,278,2,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,65.9,"Yes, I would reccomend this game. Is it the best thing since the invention of pizza since people are claiming? Not really.  The Good:  - Very Pretty Graphics / Reasonably optimized - Great Customization - Fully voiced, great overall quality of acting - Good world building and lore, main story can be a bit convoluted at times. - Reasonably Balanced  The Bad:  - I'm not very fond of a couple of combat systems. I think they have overdone the surface system. Every combat , even the tiniest ones end up a swirling chaos of destruction everywhere with burning/poison/shock/blood what have you everywhere. - Mobs instantly spawn on conveniently placed vantage points to harass you all the time. It's less about organic fights and more like forcing you to reload because you were exploring and not ready for a fight to spawn from thin air. This kinda creates the feeliing that the game is bending the rules against you, cheapening the experience overall. - Mediocre tutorial overall. Fails to tell you some key details like Lizards don't need shovels and skeletons don't need lockpicks. - Some bugs, like only half you party entering combat while the other half watches. You have to manually move your characters into combat, even though they are right there in the first place.  All in all, if you're a fan of CRPGs you'll likely enjoy this as I have. but, if you're new to the genre, there are more friendly places to start."
1516,PriesT,130,2,0,"October 19, 2017",Recommended,137.9,"This game is a gem! Pure and simple. If you're considering buying this game, just go ahead and do it!   I won't be going into details, you can read that from a bunch of other reviews, but i'll just meantion one seriously annoying flaw: Quests not closing properly.  You'll come across 20-30'ish quests during this game, that, even though you complete them, won't successfully close in your journal - they will be closed as if you failed them or diddnt follow them to the end after moving on the the next chapter. This is super frustrating in a heavely storydriven RPG.  However, this is really the only major flaw i can think of. Sure, theres some minor annoynces, like the trading and inventory UI, but you'll get used to them.  Big thumps up, and big improvement over DOS 1."
1517,ShadyChicken,141,2,0,"September 20, 2017",Recommended,83.0,"TL:DR The game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in' awesome enough to make me say, ""Let me write a quick review"" and write a chunk of text. This is one of my first reviews. Buy the game.   Probably the best game I've played in a very long time. The character creation took me around an hour, the prolouge took me an hour, and the ""tutorial"" island has taken me around seven hours and counting of non-stop fun. I await the day I get off the island and see the whole game through. I'm starting to think that this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing island is the entire game, but I can tell that the developers put a lot of damn work into a marvelous game that will make you feel like you're sitting at the DnD table experiencing the best storyline of your lifetime.  The game is addicting, and hooks you with different storylines that make you want to come back onto the game everytime you open Steam. The combat is very difficult, yet very fun. The core element that makes the combat so fun is it's difficulty, it makes this ARPG have a sense of a RTS inside of it. You have to be smart about what moves you make, how you make them, and how you can use the enviornment around you to your advantage.   To give you an idea of how much I approve of this game, this is the first review I've ever really written (I've wrote a few half‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•derpy ones before). I believe this game, and its hard working developers deserve the Game of the Year award due to the amount of work they put into a game that was funded by a KICKSTARTER!   This game shows you how GAMES are SUPPOSED to be made! This game isn't created by EA, Ubisoft, or some other company that pumps out half‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• unfinished games to the public yearly just to pump in cash from fans of the older games who want to see if they have FINALLY fixed their beloved franchise. You don't come across a Halo Reach or a childhood memory quality game often nowadays, but this game will make you feel like a child again wanting to come home already so you can hop on your character and continue the storyline that you left off engrossed in.  Please purchase this game if you love DnD, RPGs, RTSs, or anything of the sorts! These developers deserve the money, and YOU deserve a GOOD GAME for once instead of rubbish games like CALL OF DUTY INFINITE WARFARE!"

Not only that, but this game will introduce you to new and interesting game mechanics that are both a pleasure to play with and against. When things go wrong in the game, you can't help but laugh it off because you are fully aware that your faults lay in your own mistakes or lack of understanding about certain core mechanics.

This game is definitely a must buy for any rpg lover.  If there is one thing I can hope to see in the future, it is official DLC. I would love to experience new classes, new abilities, new gear, and new stories. It would be nice to have a playthrough of the ""enemy's"" side since even many of the enemies can be misunderstood or mislead. Also, a story revolving around the races that aren't present in this game could make for more gameplay and story without taking away from the existing one.

The puzzles and battles are the most strategic and amazing srpg battles I seen with environmental destruction being an awesome gimmick. The story is simple yet effective with a huge world with plenty to do and graphics are amazingly beutiful.  I was never bored playing it.  It will be amazing to see this game get finished and voice acting added(which is in the orginal Divinity).  But for an early access it does give you a good taste of the game and you can tell the finished product will be great.

I also played Divinity Original Sin 1 and als ready had a lot of fun there. Unfortunatly i never completed it, because i was missing a stone shard, that ive never found.  But i have to say THIS is way more casual than the first part. It is easier to get into, but still the quest are missing categorization to side or main quest and we got stuck some times (but way less than in Divinity 1).  Pros: + Splitscreen for 2 Players + can be fully played with only 2 characters using ""lonewolf"" ability. (2 Player 2 charaters is a good setup and the lonewolf makes it pretty easy in some parts of the game) + large worlds giving a lot of playtime and discovery. + all RPG elements are very well implemented (Looting and Leveling is as it shoudl be, most important and fun) + a lot of side storys and word telling, giving you a great feeling for the world youre playing in  Cons: - Some minor bugs. I got totally stuck one time! Make sure to save as often as you can - really annoying popup window, everytime i start. TO ALL WHO SAY THEIR GAME DOESNT WORK: it is probably this. The game tries to connect to some sort of service, which fails. Make sure to have .NET framework installed. Start the game, wait 2mins, try to start it again. then the popup should show. Click ""OK"" and the game shoudl start. - The quests are not obvious. It is always a problem to know what to do, in order to solve them, also a lot of quests interfer with each other, which leads to quests cannot be closed and so on. If you are stuck lookup the internet. I dont think its possible to completely fail the main quest though.   Conclusion: This is a great game and if you got a real life friend who also loves RPGs, grab 2 controllers and play, you will not regret it. I have not tried playing it Single Player."

1558,TheCynicalTaco,154,2,0,February 3,Recommended,237.1,"I've got to say that after 200 hours of experiencing this game and trying out different means of playing, I've encountered an experience like no other. It is obvious that the developers of this game have put in their hearts to making a game that best suits the wants of a community of tired gamers who just wanted the freedom to make decisions, to customize their gameplay, and have a fully immersive story all along the way. Not only that, but this game will introduce you to new and interesting game mechanics that are both a pleasure to play with and against. When things go wrong in the game, you can't help but laugh it off because you are fully aware that your faults lay in your own mistakes or lack of understanding about certain core mechanics. However frustrated you may get at something or upset with yourself for having made some mistake, the game is interesting and engaging enough to motivate you to try again and learn from your mistakes. This game is definitely a must buy for any rpg lover.  If there is one thing I can hope to see in the future, it is official DLC. I would love to experience new classes, new abilities, new gear, and new stories. It would be nice to have a playthrough of the ""enemy's"" side since even many of the enemies can be misunderstood or mislead. Also, a story revolving around the races that aren't present in this game could make for more gameplay and story without taking away from the existing one. Finally, more emphasis on the cooking/crafting system would be warranted. As it stands, crafting is not very important as you can find everything that is craftable and more. One of the only important recipes you need to know: Shoes + Nails = saved lives."

The freedom to do whatever and the ""hidden"" things you can make or counteract various parts of the game make it really fun to just keep messing with. Like crafting nails with boots to make shoes that are slip proof (ice), I had no idea it would even work like that but the novelty of figuring that one out was fantastic!  This game gives you the flexibility to kill anyone, and I mean anyone. You might pay for it if you aren't high enough level to attack them but you still have the chance to ink out a victory from dire straits.   The conversations are rich and your dialogue can actually have a meaningful impact on your game.   I would highly encourage to play coop with your friends, its a load of fun!

One thing that tends to bug me about these games is the inventory systems with 3,000 different items that all do the same thing, this game suffers from that a bit, but there is a decent sorting UI as well as quick filters to get to what you want.

1575,Uglzorp,"3,153",2,0,February 11,Recommended,203.1,"Top-notch sequel that improves upon the first game in every way. The game is still incredibly open-ended and allows for all sorts of emergent gameplay. The writing is better, with more developed companions and a more layered story. Combat is deeper, with the addition of physical and magic armor that prevent you from immediately CCing enemies at the start of a fight. Now you have to carefully choose who to focus down first while considering your own defenses. On Tactician difficulty, the AI is good at picking targets and countering your moves so you definitely need to think two steps ahead. Elevation is a significant factor in combat as well, with ranged attack damage, range and line of sight being affected. There's also a much wider variety of enemies and spells/abilities, along with an expanded crafting system. Finally, the game is huge. It's about twice as big as the first game and there's no filler. Every quest, combat encounter and dungeon is carefully crafted and rewarding to play.   The only flaw is the UI. Managing your inventory is pretty cumbersome. Part of the problem is that the game is technically playable with a single character and each character in the party is treated as a solo player, so there's no shared inventory. When you're trading with a merchant, you can only access one character's inventory at a time, making it difficult to compare item stats. Trading prices are also affected by character-specific traits, so you'll need to first move the items you want to sell to the character who will get the best prices. Also, the game doesn't do a good job of explaining the many status effects. Some are self-explanatory, like Bleeding or Burning. Others, like Suffocating or Deaf, are not. Basically, the only way to learn what these do is to apply them or have them applied in combat. Larian should learn from Obsidian here and provide tooltip explanations anywhere you see status effects mentioned.  Overall, a fantastic game that would be even better with a few UI improvements."

You have to follow the quest by yourself, with no obvious quest markers or whatsoever. You need to click every NPC here and there to proceed and the NPCs give you other quests along the way, you end up with more quests in your hand, which is awesome. It doesn't feel forced like some games do, the quests comes naturally to you and there are plenty of ways to do them, or not to. It's like playing one of those table-top RPGs. Speaking of TRPGs, if you have friends to play with, I believe it would be a much better experience.  Personally I have one and only problem though.

I highly suggest you play coop because the dimension it adds to the game is so much fun as you and friend(s) just run into all the quirks and silliness. Every fight can be one if you just switch it up and try out new tactics.. or just get lucky! The amount of details and love put into this game makes AAA companies look like indie developers.  The game is not without its flaws, the crafting is shallower than it can be, some armors/weapons never would have a use in someone who wants to win, misclicking on things in battle can really mess up a long fight and turn the tide negatively and the rest is mainly just nit-picky stuff.   Overall this game is a solid product, it looks nice, it plays nice and its completely mastered the art of an rpg in a sandboxm, meaning you have rules and tools, but you can often abuse or mess around and accomplish things in interesting ways. This game is worth the cover charge and should be a no-brainer if you are on the fence and it is on sale!"

The things happening in this game are so well written, exquisitly described, the love scenes are just amazing to read. And you will hate, you will hate a lot of characters and you will wait hours and hours to be finally able to fight them and it will feel like revenge. You will curse in front of your PC, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you! die! eat this you piece of‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• BURN! Yeah, it is like that. Its an emotional game, talk to your characters, love them, hate them, see them evolve.  You will not believe the skill progress in this game, what you can become during this game... it will be sutil, slow,  but at some point it you will realize how terrifyingly powerful you are. And it feels good. And the game is still hard, battles are long and tactical. You can still die, but damn you can put up a fight. And the ending... amazing, Its very satisfying. You will not be dissapointed. It has its bugs and some uncompleted quests but nothing serious.  Enjoy amazing writing, amazing story, and amazing characters. It ended and all i have is an aplause.

We killed one of the bosses by turning all of the blood in a room into poison and then teleporting a candle into the poison, blowing up all of the enemies.

If you're a fan of cRPG's in any sense (think Baulder's Gate) you will absolutely love this.   The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, the graphics are great, the gameplay is where it REALLY shines. The fights are difficult, the AI is actually smart, and tactician will put your characters through a grinder when you thought you had it down.  At no point in the game did I feel like it was a slog or a chore to get through during my first playthrough, there was always something meaningful I could do. Just one more side quest before the main story, helping out this one person, talking to this one chicken. The story is also very well done, I feel as though I could actually talk to the characters if they were real people, they are fleshed out very well.   Larian is an extremely awesome company, they delayed the release of the game to add in a fully voiced game due to community request. They listen to their customers, apply the feedback properly, and keep them updated. Definitely the best game company out there right now.  The first act is a very good tutorial, the second act builds the world and the story, and act 3 and 4 take the fun of those two and multiply it by 5. I don't have enough good things to say about this game. The only negative is that it has now ruined so many others for me, because they won't be as good as this. Now I'm bored and don't know what else to start playing.   Ratings: Music: 15/10 (seriously the soundtrack is THAT good) Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Difficulty: 10/10 (has difficulties for all levels of players)  Overall it is a top 3 game that I have ever played.

Game Master mode for those who would like to play with their friends even after the campaign. A great mod tool that allows you do almost anything in the game. If you willing to spend some time off cause. Content in the game for 100+ hours minimum. Arena PVP mode exists.  Cons: The game still has some bugs. Though all great RPGs has and developers are working really hard fixing them. GM mode could have more love. It lacks a lot of crucial features and a lot of things that exist in the game are unavailable. Though mods in the workshop can help with fixing some of them. Arena PVP mode could have even more love. It's very primitive and it seems like developers haven't worked much on it. Hope they will improve it in the future.  Should you buy it? Definitely!"

1628,Zealous,48,2,1,"November 8, 2017",Recommended,389.0,"Honestly, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a fun game. It has a solid story, good character design, and a plethora of items and quests. It kept me busy for a good couple weeks, and entertained me the whole time. The combat system is entertaining, if a bit challenging, and the world is large and fun to explore, packed with secrets and quests. There are so many choices when picking a character. In general, the game offers lots of choices, but there are so many character combinations it's almost hard to decide what you want to do, so you just make a few characters and play the game twice. It also has great modding community, and all it's other modes are solid as well. It does suffer from some issues though. The UI needs a bit of work, some areas are laggy, some hitboxes are confusing, and the journal sometimes doesn't provide enough information. It's not a perfect game. However, it is relatively new. GIve it time, and I guarantee, all these minor issues will be fixed. The only real issue I have with the game is the ending. You get your final battle and all, but in the end, all that happens is that you hear about what happened to everyone after the events of the game, and some of it sounds like fun, to be honest. All in all, this is a solid gaming experience and a must play for any fan of the RPG genre. It is worth the price."
1629,WHOELPOUNDER,192,2,0,"December 1, 2017",Recommended,417.8,"Larian has done it again with another 10/10 clasic RPG experience. I cant wait for the EE for this beauty. Breakdown below.  Pros: +++++Free complete respecs are available any time after act 1. Allows you a lot of room to experiment and discover what builds are the best/most fun. +++Same great combat, build customization, and RPG experience from DOS1EE ++Lonewolf is back ++Race/preset lore choices on character creation ++Amazing mutliplayer support, up to 4 players ++PVP made more easy and fun though the declare war and online arena system ++Tons of flavor and unique items. Several kinds of items i have never seen in another RPG +All the classes/builds are viable just like in DOS1 +New source point system tries to control spells that trivialize the game +Great flavor and level design +A classic soundtrack +Open your game to the world and let people join or join random games +Difficulty settings range from ""wow are they even trying to hurt me"" to ""this fight will take multiple hours to figure out and clear"" +Many new races/enemy types +Memory system prevents you from having to manage 3 full spell bars and makes characters feel more unique/specialized compared to the party.  Mixed/preference:  +/-Game is significantly harder than DOS1EE +/-Some of the more broken spells and abilities have been removed +/-CC has been massively nerfed +/-Crafting has also been nerfed, but all crafting can be done from level 1 +/-Stealing has been slightly nerfed, now after you steal you have to portal away for a few min to let the heat die down.   Cons: -Source point controls are easily bypassed, but are also cumbersomely attached to abilities are are needed to do basic things out of combat, like bless. The game also disincentivises experimenting with new abilities if they have source point costs, because you have to refill the source points after. Some abilities are attached to source points that are clearly not good enough to warrant the source point cost, and the ability will never be used. -some people report lots of bugs, but I have done many playthroughs and have not encountered anything that I could not resolve in-game -cant dye your outfits anymore -with the new system, tons of things have been removed. No more weapon or armor modification except poisoning and adding runes.  --No orcs (c'mon man wtf) ---Parties with split damage types (magic/physical) are heavily penalized by the new armor system. Biggest gripe by far. If your party is split 2-2 the game will be much harder. If you have 3 physical damage and 1 magic damage, the magic damage hero will often feel like it isnt contributing much to the encounters unless it is summon/support.   Overall the game is absolutely amazing. I may have a lot of cons on that list, but just like a spouse, its easy to nit-pick the flaws  of something you love so much. Additionally, I am comparing the release version of DOS2 to the EE version of DOS1. I strongly encourage anyone who likes RPGs or is interested in a more classic/hardcore RPG experience. You will not regret it."

I agree with some reviews, that the combat is not easy, but honestly this is exactly what makes it fun... the combination of different elements, height differences, physics and the fact that even the simplest enemies have special skills etc. make each combat interesting.  No more grinding through simple skeletons with the same tactics each time! Heroes will die and you will have a hard time to ressurect them. You will face enemies you can't beat (check their level before engaging) - there is no hand holding in this game!

1653,Marirow,457,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,44.6," I'd recommend this game if you're a fan of tactical games like XCOM or Fire Emblem, or if you like story-heavy games.  The combat is the strongest part of the game, but it's also the hardest to get into; I had to restart the game multiple times to get the right party structure to tackle the game's challenges.  Adaptability and crowd control are key in this combat system. If you don't have the right party makeup, skills, and items, then it's going to feel like the game is cheating you. Enemies will constantly be inflicting status conditions (usually turn-skipping ones) if your armor isn't up to snuff. A lack of skills means that enemies will be able to out-maneuver and out-damage you. And, of course, having a party of all mages isn't a good idea when archers can just sit and take potshots at you three times a turn. If you're not sure what you're doing, there's no shame in playing on the lower difficulty setting. Trust me.  The other two major selling points of this game are the story and the exploration, both of which are a bit weaker in terms of originality but are just as great as the combat system. The dialogue is your standard Neverwinter Nights affair, made a bit spicier by the Tags system. Simply put, each character has Tags (related to aspects of their personality, history, or appearance) that give unique dialogue options. You can even acquire new tags as you play, making the system versatile as well. The dialogue itself is well-written and hilarious at times, giving the game a comedic twist and elevating it from a drab, boring fantasy adventure. I won't spoil the story, but I'll say that after 30 hours I've only brushed up against what the story has to offer. The thousands upon thousands of dialogue trees are backed up by some impressive voice acting, which makes reading through the game's story (which might as well be novel length, if not longer) actually fun and engaging instead of a slog.  The exploration, then. This is probably the weakest part of the game-- not  bad,  just  weaker.  The world is enormous and full of sidequests, characters, and miniature adventures to go on, which really scratched my explorative itch. However, I often felt that the game wasn't using its exploration elements as well as it could. Quests can only really reward you with money and gear; money always gets hoovered by buying new, better gear from shopkeepers, and gear almost always becomes obsolete as soon as your characters level up. I found myself picking up really cool, unique gear, only for it to be  immediately  replaced by something slightly better. This is on top of a loot system that leaves your inventory constantly cluttered with random garbage, and forces you to check every single empty crate just in case there's a scroll of resurrection inside. I swear, Rivellon has an epidemic of empty crates.  In short, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a  very good game.  My biggest complaints are with the little things. The combat is just a little to obtuse, the exploration is just a little too unimportant, etc. The good things far, far outweigh the bad. If you're a fan of CRPGs, like games that focus on the story, or enjoy tactical combat, this game is an excellent buy."

1658,SuicideKing,107,2,0,January 22,Recommended,177.9,"At the risk of heaping too much praise on the game despite not even having left the initial Fort Joy area, it's bloody marvellous.  There are so many paths to take in the story and each NPC interaction feels unique. I'm playing 2 mutliplayer games in parallel, with different characters, and it's played out differently in both cases because of different starting variables and events, along with different player actions. It's really great. BTW, it's not like we haven't escaped Fort Joy because we don't know how to - oh no, we could have escaped at multiple moment, but we chose to stay. Partly to XP farm, partly because there's just so much to do!  Moreover, it addresses the issue i usually have with games that have level systems and loot - the weapons scale with your attributes, and higher level gear can be equipped if you have the appropriate attributes. So for example, if you're playing a melee build and have the appropriate Strength, you can equip level 4 armour while being level 3.  Combat is pretty fun if you're into turn-based stuff. Think ""new XCOM but with Action Points"", but perhaps more chaotic and varied. Spread some oil, set it ablaze. Then chuck poison in it to watch it go boom! Or the other way around.There are pre-defined classes but you can tweak them as you like, and respec any time. I haven't even got to the point where I can use Source abilities yet.  Crafting seems pretty complex, but it's really cool. Find a stick, some rope and a knife - you now have a knife-on-a-stick and can use it as a sword. Find a stick and a large sea shell, you now have a magic staff. Have a potion flask and a poison barrel? Well, now you have a poison flask. Why'd you need a poison flask? Because Undead heal with poison (and get damaged by health/vitality potions).  Anyway, it's an exceptionally well made game. Runs pretty smooth for me at pretty high settings (can't remember, i think it just set itself to ultra, and i didn't have to tamper with the settings) @ 1080p with a i5-3570K, GTX 670 and 8GB of RAM. Haven't encountered any bugs yet. Let that sink in. A game bought 3 months after release, in 2017, has not had a single bug so far, in 20 hours of play.  Highly recommended, obviously! :D  edit: The music is great too!"
1659,ninjannuity,253,2,0,"September 25, 2017",Recommended,97.1,"Did you ever love playing a tabletop RPG (DnD, DCC, MCC, etc) but the logistics of getting one together was hard? Look no further adventurer, for Divinity: Original Sin 2 creates a tabletop experience right from your 'battlestation'.   Naturally, the game is challenging and open, there are many options of how to play and what to do in any given scenario. Kill everybody! What the hell right, they're in  your  way after all right? Or, befriend as many people (monsters, creatures, and animals as well) as is possible! What the hell right, they're part of  your  adventure after all right? Dialogue is so well done in this game, so profoundly voice acted that most characters have a unique feel and attitude as well as conversation choices (often per Origin character, meaning the five Origin characters have unique interactions with the world).  Character creation is fluid, meaning, at a certain point in the game you have an opportunity to re-spec each character in your campaign into a better presentation of what you wanted in the game. For example, didn't like the summoner healer and instead wanted a summoner ranger? Well, why not! Or perhaps a jack of all trades? That is probably one of the more enriching experiences of the game, feeling as though one did not ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up in terms of how they allotted skill points.  One of my favorite elements is the use of surface elements (blood & water, or either electrified, ice, fire, poison, oil, and cursed ground -- you'll see that for the first time and it is an intense experience especially on harder difficulties).  But beyond that, the playing with friends experience is open and ongoing. Say a friend can only hop in for a few hours on the weekend, while you've played 34 hours in 3 days? Well, they can jump into one of the characters you have, re-spec them to their liking, finish a couple quests and get out all while continuing along your level base and campaign. (and you can do the same to their campaign, should they ever make one)  PROS: - Great character development and voice acting - Awesome fluidity in how to build characters - Satisfying and intense turn-based combat (on Tactician it is hard, but not impossible) - Rewarding unique playstyles without catering too much to cheese (without giving it away, the game will sometimes know if you cheese certain puzzles) - Ongoing joining/leaving process for party play with friends - Brings visualization to the tabletop experience (imo, but still) - An absolutely enormous amount of content - Challenging and fun (or frustrating and befuddling) puzzles! - Connecting the dots on quests can be sometimes misleading, meaning the player needs to actually put in the work to logically figure out what the questbook/discovered dialogue related to the quest means in order to complete it -- this is not always straightforward and direct.  CONS: - There actually are some bugs, believe it or not, and because of that remember (REMEMBER!) to save OFTEN - Somewhat slow-paced (not a personal con, as tabletops are slow-paced, but I have heard this be a turn off so I include it) - Some quests are easy to miss or hard to figure out due to the last point on PROS, (not a personal con, but it is something that may frustrate people who aren't used to having the game hold their hand through exploration/decision making related to important quests)   tl;dr: great open RPG with turn-based combat akin to tabletop gaming, think outside the box and be rewarded, discover more about the characters and races and be rewarded (or disgusted). Combat is wonderful, albeit tricky, and full of dazzling experiences. Great for picking up and leaving off with friends who have busy or demanding schedules.  If you're a fan of turn-based RPGs then give this one a go on sale, or if you're a die-hard tabletop RPG person pick it up when you can. If you have friends you can convince to play this with you, do that, probably one of the best buddy-gaming experiences I have had in a great while."

It doesn't feel forced like some games do, the quests comes naturally to you and there are plenty of ways to do them, or not to. It's like playing one of those table-top RPGs. Speaking of TRPGs, if you have friends to play with, I believe it would be a much better experience.  Personally I have one and only problem though.

We can also choose between the races of Human, Lizard, Elves, Dwarfs and, my personal favorite, the Undead; whatever you choose, rest assured that even just your race will have an effect on how you're viewed and treated in the world of D:OS 2.  On top of all of this, Larian has even dared to go completely beyond the conventional by implementing a fully-fledged Game Master Mode -- a feature which to me is extremely interesting, allowing up to five players to enjoy customly created campaigns as a group of up to four adventurers and one Game Master, to create the virtual equivalent of the good old Pen & Paper roleplaying experience.  All in all, this has every chance of becoming not just the best RPG of this year, but also one of the best RPGs period."

My only complaint is that the GM mode is not as good as it should be. I wish it had been setup as a campaign editor, allowing you to set dialogue, even if its text only. Additionally there should have been the ability to set up triggers for events, so when the players step on them it triggers a desired event such as spawning enemies or environmental hazards."

This leads to me often skipping conversations, and suddenly I'm declared a hero, and have 10 people attacking me. This could be catastrophic, but as I said, I always loot. Turns out drinking tea and spend half the match eating random items is a very good strategy.   My co-op partner in crime is not a looter, but actually reads the dialogue. Working together is thus a very good way of playing. He gets all the story + depth of the game while I get to spend more time around looting.   A tip tho: Distribute the loot, quite impractical when the team member with all the healing + scrolls manages to set herself on fire and die... 3 attempts in a row.   Just waiting for the loot from the kickstarter now.  The lizard design is absolutely gorgeous, and I spent quite some time choosing the best lizard style to match my true self, only to keep running around with a bucket or blanket over my head inside the game.  10/10  "

1685,Nezumi,154,2,0,"September 21, 2016",Recommended,261.8,Probably gonna be the best game of the year.
1686,Owning Duck,73,2,0,"November 2, 2017",Recommended,361.4,"This game is now my most favorite game, I played DOS twice, one playthrough by myself (150 hours) and one with my friend (60 hours). I can say that I really enjoyed the first game and was really looking forward to DOS 2. I'm almost 200 hours into it and I am not even done with the campaign. But being nearly done I think I can give a proper review.  Combat: So most people criticize the game for being turn-based rather than a real-time with pause function. But it feels right in place as the combat still feels so engaging. The combat is tougher since a lot of skills that you have, the enemies have as well. This makes the combat harder but also more rewarding once you get past it. The game is hard yet fair. There are fights that seem impossible but the game provides us with the tools to win or hides the tools within the world. A lot of the skills feel strong and useful. But towards the end game, I find that magic damage started to be more obsolete as it is much faster and easier to physical as that it the most reliable way to damage. Though that might be because my team consisted of 3 physical dealers and one wizard.  Story: This is by far my favorite part of the game. The story is rather simple yet done in a way that makes it compelling. And as someone who played the other Divinity games, there are a lot of surprising plot twists that I was surprised by. But where the game shines the most is the origin stories. You can either create your own character or choose one of 6 pre-made origin characters that have their own backgrounds. And and these stories are very well-written with equally well made characters. It is so interesting to see how much the game changes because of who you are. If you didn't pick an origin character, you can still recruit them but after a certain point, they will become unavaible. It is a rather intersting thing of being a side character to the origin character's stories though. And each origin chracter will have a personal quest which will result in some drastic endings. But some advice, do not play as Lohse. Not because she is bad, she is a great character with a one of my favorite stories. But Lohse is best when played as a companion and her personal ending yields the best reward a video game has ever given.  UI: I will be blunt about it, it's bad. Inventory management is a nightmare. Sadly it is also required in powering up your weapons in the end game. You will spend a long time in your inventory looking through it to find a single item. Crafting can be done through a seperate menu but most of the time you will be combing random stuff together and that is horrible. In the end game, you will have so much clutter mostly involving books and paper with no swift and reliable way to dispose of them.   Other Notes: The game has quite alot of bugs as well. The first area will be rather polished because it was in early access for a long time. But the game is large and some parts are even broken at times. But I would like to say that I have not faced a bug bad enough to take away from my enjoyment. The game is best played (in my opinion) with a roll with it attitude. Just accept mistakes that happen. It is really fun to see all my mistakes bite me in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•later down the line. And before I forget, the soundtrack. It is a masterpiece. DOS 2 has a different composer from the past Divinity games (RIP Kirill) but the new composer has truly put his heart and soul into it and it is an absolute joy to listen to.   Just buy the game. Larian deserves all of the praise and hopefully they will make a console version so we all can share in the masterpiece that is Divinity Original Sin."

Everything that was good about the first game is still here so it's not like relearning an entirely new game, and a lot of the clunkier parts about the first game like enormous skill cooldowns, being locked into 1 or 2 spell trees based on allocated points are refined and looking good. Love the sense of humour of the studio and the hard work and care they put into the game. Recommend highly for people who liked the first D:OS and for people new to the game. Don't need to have played the first D:OS to fully enjoy this one."
1694,Gary Ginderhal,188,2,0,"May 14, 2017",Recommended,71.8,"Fantastic gameplay, even in an alpha state. That's the short of it, the long of it is a little more complicated.  This game's got a lot to offer even in an extremely unfinished state as it is, and I'll probably change my review when the next story segment comes out and likely again when the game's released as a finished product. As it stands, without voices, with missing dialogue, with missing assets, and occasional bugs, this is still a beautiful game that, while short, offers some pretty in-depth character customization, even up to level 8 or 9.   The elemental effect/terrain altering magic from the first game is back, and better than ever, with a few new combinations, as well as the Bless/Curse quasi-elements that can transform an already dangerous fire patch into a lethal Cursed Flame that sets enemies or allies aflame with immolation that can't be put out with water, or transform an annoying but avoidable oil patch into Blessed Oil that fortifies allies instead of slowing them, making it a detour you WANT to walk through for a buff rather than a hindrance to walk around. I constantly found myself wondering how best to use my action points to turn terrain to my advantage rather than simply cluttering up the field with dangerous patches of fire, ooze, or electrified water.  Creating characters is even more in-depth than the last game, and many of the old skills from the first game have either been changed or removed for more interesting ones. Summoning is now its own skill tree, and is best paired with spells that create environmental effects, or simply on a Lizard who can breathe a patch of flame wherever they want, as the summons, a totem and an ""Incarnate"" gain the element they're conjured on, either water, fire, poison, oil, or blood. Even with all the spells at my disposal, I still found myself favoring the weapons I'd chosen before, as even with a hundred spells at my disposal, sometimes it's nice to just smack someone with a big sword.  This game can be very, VERY hard, but often in a Dark Souls way. Usually you'll know why you died, and can reload to try to fix it next time. Enemy casting a lot of fire spells? Make sure to purchase a rain scroll or use more water magic to counteract them, or simply stunlock the enemy to death and try to pick apart the enemy's strategy. It's pretty rare that you'll encounter a fight that you simply cannot win when you first encounter it, unless you go into the battle extremely underleveled (If you're more than 1 level below your opponent, you're probably going to lose). Generally fights last a while, so make sure to prepare for both long and short combats as it's rare that you'll go into a fight completely outclassing your opponent, and be prepared to burn potions and the like, as they WILL give you an edge in combat and it's generally not worth trying to tough it out without them. There's apparently an entire mechanic for food, but I've never gotten good results from it and the buffs generally arent worth the action points it takes to eat it, so you can't simply down six cheese wheels to heal to full.  The storyline's not quite as good as the gameplay, sadly, but I'm pretty confident that with voice acting and some tweaks it will get far stronger. The quest journal's still hardly worth looking at unless you've totally forgotten what you've done and feel like looking through a complicated and user-unfriendly transcript of everyone you've ever spoken to. The journal could definitely use a change as it was often hard to maintain who's quests were what and with four characters with FOUR SEPARATE JOURNALS THAT OFTEN HAVE SEPARATE QUESTS it's quite difficult to keep everything straight. Thankfully it's easy to just start walking in a direction and you'll probably run into some enemies that are either your level or much, much higher, leading to a quick-reload and a different path taken. The storyline itself introduces a number of people, Dalis the Hammer, Bishop Alexandar, a blind elven seer, and far, far, FAR more, each with a complex backstory that almost everyone's happy to narrate to you at the drop of a hat, which can get a little overwhelming sometimes, but it's an inherently wordy RPG, so that's just par for the course.  The story's tone is classic Larian, with a serious and epic plot that tries to be grim and po-faced when the rest of the world is made up of goofy talking skulls, riddling rats, mad witches, puns, and adorable dog quest-givers. Although the main storyline ends up looking a little out-of-place, it's nice that it's there and that the game's not simply a permanent comedy routine. I will say that some will find the tone kind of schizophrenic, and although I'd agree with that I'd also say that it's not a game to be taken seriously, and is instead more a sandbox for one or more players can wreak havoc or play within the rules.  Character customization is a little lacking at the moment, but that's almost secondary compared to the great animations each race/gender has, as well as each armor set looking different on each race, with an emphasis on eastern cloth for Lizards, or a hardier iron look for Dwarves. Spells have intricate and impressive effects, even for basic spells such as ""Throw a rock"" or ""hit someone extra hard."" While the hairdos and facial options presented to each race and gender is pretty small, it's generally enough that you probably won't get your characters confused.  On an entirely different note, the game's graphics and representation is amazing. I love the vibrant colors, and beautiful tropical locale for the start of the game. The one big downside is that the first part of the game takes place in a giant prison, but the atmosphere is that of a tropical resort, with sunny skies, beautiful coral beaches, and a shanty-town that looks more like a run-down tourist town than a brutal gulag for wizards. Although it wouldn't be nearly as pretty to look at, it would have been nice to have a more oppressive environment to start in, and escape to the tropical paradise later on, for contrast. That being said, the shadow effects playing off trees and logs, and the drop dead gorgeous beaches make for an impressive opening, and when the future chapters of the game are released, I'll be most excited to see the environments they take place in.  To sum it all up, this game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing fantastic. Worth a look if you enjoy slower-paced RPGs, even though the storyline's only about 1/3rd complete. With almost all of its flaws coming from being an unfinished alpha and very few coming from the actual design or gameplay. Pretty much fun in every aspect, with an insane level of combat and character customization depth, this game is absolutely worth your time."

It has fun combact, story and the voice acting is quality. I think if the game looks interesting you have to play it! More in depth below.  Story: so far i feel the story is more in the people you meet rather than the overall world. Honestly i dont know 100% what the story is about but i feel that i will over time an im perfectly fine with that. Saying that the world feels like it has a personality of its self. every inch feels as if it has history which makes the overall experiance better.  Combat: Although some people wont like the slower pace of the game i fondly love it. It is not to slow that keeps me waiting impatiantly and isnt to fast where i make constant mistakes (althought i still make alot). I can still plan out my attack with a wide variety of skills all very unique and fun. The level design in these combact areas also alow for alot of strategic battles that leaves me very satisfied.   Voice acting and animations: Voice acting is one of the best i ahve coem across in recent history. Remember get pet pal perk because you will miss alot of amazing voice acting and story that makes the environment feel even richer. Animations are as good as they can get.  There are a few teenie weenie issues that are very much issues rather than an annoyances. for example some items automatically going onto the hot bar and your character when not being controlle somtimes drift a few step to the side which walk into a trap, elemental grounds or worst of all into the sight of a shrieker which can get annoying espeailly if you have no resurrection scrolls or a recent save but in the scheme of things, meh.

1726,dep,81,2,0,August 29,Recommended,192.0,"Pros: Great look about the game, an old school isometric style but fully realised in 3D. The amount of detail is crazy, the main maps are large and crammed with objects and details. The sound is excellent and immersive, I‚Äôd guess 95% of dialogue is voiced, the soundtrack is good and sits well in the background. The gameplay is excellent once you know how to play (see cons) and really lets you go wild with combos between your party, using and abusing the environment, and manipulating your enemies. There is a huge variety of ways to play your characters, all without rigid roles or classes, allowing you create something like a Death Knight from warrior and necromancer skills, or Ranger with bow skills and summoning skills. A massive amount of mods to make the game easier or harder or just different. Cons: There is a very steep learning curve. If you don't know, and I mean really know, what you are doing the game can seem like it's just out to annoy you. It's not (mostly), but because of the nature of the combat system the game can swing between impossible and barely a challenge without too much middle ground. The levels can be quite arbitrary in where you can go. The second island for example ranges between level 9 and 15, and you can quite easily wonder into a fight you just have no chance of winning at that time. As the game does it‚Äôs best not to hold your hand, don‚Äôt expect much help from the quests. The massive array of options in playing your character also gives you many more ways to mess up. It might seem like a good idea to make a necromancer tank but you won‚Äôt do enough damage to heal yourself enough, better off going full offensive.

I've been having a blast playing with my partner in crime. It's perfect for co-op if you're looking to adventure into an interesting world with 3 other friends or just your favorite person, I highly recommend it.   You really have to communicate with your team or partner about what roles each other will be playing if you want to succeed in this game. For example, I'm the persuasive barterer and lockpicker, with an archer and knight. My boyfriend is the item finder and crafter, who plays a healer/summoner/buffer and a battlemage. Our team works pretty perfectly together. Defeating enemies after a long battle with no one dying because the both of us expertly communicated with one another over who to hit and what moves to make, etc, is extremely satisfying. I even feel much closer to him because of how well we work together, the game is quite the bonding experience.   It's also fun laughing at some of the many absurd interactions in the game, like being licked by a dog whose been eating corpses and ending up getting deseased because of that, all because you told the dog it was a good boy.   Long story short, I recommend this game as both a great solo experience, and an incredible muiltiplayer experience.  Update: The game is still fantastic."

Combat is deep and cinematic, both punishing and rewarding. Your party has their own fascinating stories and personalities, and the world your playing in feels chaotic and on the brink of complete anarchy. Its shaping up to be an excellent game, Im already finding myself both wanting more, and eagerly awaiting the September 14th release.

1750,¬ø,313,2,0,May 4,Recommended,150.3,"It is pretty uncommon that I write reviews, and I will preface that when I played this game it was much much closer to its release date.   This game is utterly amazing, that is not to say there are negatives (I will have a bullet point pros con list at the bottom of this review), but it did not take long for me to think of this game as one of my favorite RPG games ever made. I think of this game as a modern day baulders gate. It has great story, its sound tracks are amazing, combat is diverse and enjoyable. Multiplayer was done Superbly.  Now if you are thinking about getting this game, a here are a few things you should know before purchase. Combat is turnbased, if you do not like turnbased games you may not like this games (especially because it is not a cheap game). DO NOT play honor mode if you have yet to beat the game yet (its a mode that if your party all dies your ONLY save gets deleted, and the fights are at the hardest difficulty level), the triggers for this are NOT common, however there are traps that will instantly kill folk around them, Which I walked into all of them. Restarting your entire game because of a trap like that will drive you insane.    Agian I played back closer to release but, when I played there were a fair amount of bugs in the game. This game easily makes up for it, but the bugs do exsist. At certian points in the game you may be unsure what quest you should do next. (Now if you are playing normal mode this may not affect you like it did me, because I was playing a harder difficulty setting, and I needed ot make sure I was not fighting things higher level than my self) Because if you plan to follow the monster levels and have them be equal to yours, it requires you to jump around the map alot finding out what quest areas are your level (unless of course you look up a guide, i would advise agianst that).  The 2nd act? (third map its a island), I was not too fond of this area, and I think it will most likely be most peoples least favorite spot, there are some dry moments, just take it slow and get through it this game has some really cool suprises for you.  Also dont take lone wolf as a perk unless you want to ruin the game, its the closest thing to a cheat code in that game I know of, you can pretty much breeze through the game on hardest difficulty if you use it.   TLDR: Pros Cons List.  Pros -Great Story -Great Music -Well Balanced Combat / Enjoyable Combat -Cool Cast of characters -Good leveling system -Good multiplayer Setup -Waypoint system making map travel easier  Cons -Quest order can be confusing at times -Island map is a little dry at times  if you saw a video of this game, and liked the top down aesthetic, and understand this is a RPG, I would 10/10 rate this game for you, you should buy and play it you wont regret it."

1759,Morr-gan,334,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,116.6,"The game's start is an extremely, extreeeemely steep learning curve.  you essentially start off with no armour, and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• weapons, and will be placed against enemies that could 1v1 you and win without breaking a sweat.   Even Dark Souls gives you an easier time starting off than this, trust me.  I recommend playing an Origin character before playing as custom, to get your first experience with a unique character, as the different characters have their own personal questlines and dialogue, which is interesting.  Combat is amazing as ever, however the initiative system has changed from the first one, instead whoever simply has the highest will start (or if it's a scripted boss/enemy to go first), then it will alternate between friend/foe/friend/foe.  Magic Armour and Physical Armour are interesting and basically grants you guranteed immuntie to certain status effects, like Stunned, Knocked down and bleeding unless said armour is reduced to 0. has it's drawback as it means if you dont have the perserverence attribute levelled some you'll get stunlocked in unfortunate positions by mages.  Lots of gametime for the story, with even double if you don't skip all the dialogue and pay attention to side quests (which I didn't).  overall 9/10 some bugs, but overall game is fantastic with a great story."

Every system has been improved upon and it's as quirky as ever. Multiplayer has been improved upon at every level, I love the 'competitive"" aspect.

I highly suggest you play coop because the dimension it adds to the game is so much fun as you and friend(s) just run into all the quirks and silliness. Every fight can be one if you just switch it up and try out new tactics.. or just get lucky! The amount of details and love put into this game makes AAA companies look like indie developers.  The game is not without its flaws, the crafting is shallower than it can be, some armors/weapons never would have a use in someone who wants to win, misclicking on things in battle can really mess up a long fight and turn the tide negatively and the rest is mainly just nit-picky stuff.   Overall this game is a solid product, it looks nice, it plays nice and its completely mastered the art of an rpg in a sandboxm, meaning you have rules and tools, but you can often abuse or mess around and accomplish things in interesting ways. This game is worth the cover charge and should be a no-brainer if you are on the fence and it is on sale!"

1773,Noobsauce,83,2,0,February 18,Recommended,335.0,"Pros:  Amazing roleplaying/DnD feel. Interesting characters, witty writing, and I haven't played a game that left you this many choices since Fallout New Vegas (almost anyone can be killed at any time). Highly recommend playing one of the ""Origin"" players, or if not, at least having them as your party members, a lot of the great story telling revolves around them.  Combat system is fun and allows for a lot of theory crafting/playstyles, to the point where even people who dont' care about the RP aspect of it at all still enjoy this game. Few gripes with certain aspets but overall it feels interesting/diverse. Fights are HARD, even on normal difficulty, but far from unbeatable.   This game handles multiplayer in what is essentially a single player world better than any other game I've ever seen. The game is coded like an MMO, so you and your friends can travel hafl way across the world in a random pub and your friend can still play their game. Seemlessly allows you to hop in and out of someone's game too.  Cons:  Some weird quirks with combat that could be improved (fighting with characters while others are in dialogue, main attributes feeling uninterseting), but really this is just a tiny complaint.  In the mid part of the game it's easy to lose focus, it's so open world that you can get bogged with side quests and forget what you were supposed to be doing in the first place.  Crafting system/Inventory system feels a little meh. Crafting can honestly be 100% ignored so this  doesn't detract from the game too much, but organizing /sorting through your inventory can feel tedious at times."
1774,Agfct,404,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,117.5,"The Divinity Original Sin games are some of those hidden gems of gaming that you may have never heard of, but they just amaze you ones you start to play them.   Divinity Original sin 2 is like its predecessor focused on strategic gameplay, turn-based combat, and clever conversations. If you loved Divinity Original Sin 1 (or EE) you will love this one, and if you love old school strategic turn-based gameplay with focus on conversations (E.g. actually reading the quest description) then this game is for you.  In addition to being a completely new game, Divinity Original Sin 2 introduces new races like undead, new spells, magic armor (absorbs CC effects) and more.  Pros: -	Deep questlines with choices. -	Lots of different spells, talents, and abilities, that you choose almost freely. -	Turn based tactical combat that forces you to think. -	Voice acting on all conversations.  Cons: -	Can be brutally hard if you make the wrong choices (E.g. wrong set of spells, companions, or kills the wrong person).  Would rate it 9/10. The game has everything, but can be quite a challenge if you make a lot of wrong choices.   My Experience: Personally i have restarted my journey one time, as the first time i played i had to figure out what spells, companions and combinations of melee, ranged, magic i wanted. This game is not plug and play, and i would say it is more difficult in classic mode (normal) from the beginning then Divinity Orginal Sin EE Classic mode. You are very early on forced to look for scraps, craft gear and prepare yourself as mutch as possible in order to progress through combat. Combat is even more brutal this time around as the new magic and physical armor will prevent you from CC your enemies until it is destroyed.   The game rewards you for hard work, but you will have to work hard from very early on. Good Luck!  "

I found the first game much too difficult and complex. I then got the Enhanced Edition and recently (about a few weeks ago) got into it as I read the description and apparently you could change the mode. I chose Explorer. Still didn't invest enough time to get very far.  October 5, 2017I finally got this game, started it up, and was bombarded with numerous and amazing features. For example, the ability to choose Origin characters or create your own. There were more class-types and the environment was spectacular! This is the best looking game I've ever played.  To the rest of the game; I've played numerous times, only escaping Reaper Isles once but not even going farther than that. I've played as one Origin character in a party and an undead human conjurer as a lone wolf. Now I'm an Origin character lone wolf and am STILL having fun.  I am still finding new things throughout my few playthroughs, like the cat familiar. :D I find it amazing how you can summon a cat, them jump up to unreachable places and you can swap places with it. I also found a lot of other unique treasures and hidden places around Fort Joy and I enjoy finding them.  I am in love with Divinity: Original Sin 2. The price tag may be high, but the gameplay, content, and immersion is amazing! Brace yourselves too, it's a narrative game. -wink-"

1782,dep,81,2,0,August 29,Recommended,192.0,"Pros: Great look about the game, an old school isometric style but fully realised in 3D. The amount of detail is crazy, the main maps are large and crammed with objects and details. The sound is excellent and immersive, I‚Äôd guess 95% of dialogue is voiced, the soundtrack is good and sits well in the background. The gameplay is excellent once you know how to play (see cons) and really lets you go wild with combos between your party, using and abusing the environment, and manipulating your enemies. There is a huge variety of ways to play your characters, all without rigid roles or classes, allowing you create something like a Death Knight from warrior and necromancer skills, or Ranger with bow skills and summoning skills. A massive amount of mods to make the game easier or harder or just different. Cons: There is a very steep learning curve. If you don't know, and I mean really know, what you are doing the game can seem like it's just out to annoy you. It's not (mostly), but because of the nature of the combat system the game can swing between impossible and barely a challenge without too much middle ground. The levels can be quite arbitrary in where you can go. The second island for example ranges between level 9 and 15, and you can quite easily wonder into a fight you just have no chance of winning at that time. As the game does it‚Äôs best not to hold your hand, don‚Äôt expect much help from the quests. The massive array of options in playing your character also gives you many more ways to mess up. It might seem like a good idea to make a necromancer tank but you won‚Äôt do enough damage to heal yourself enough, better off going full offensive. If you don‚Äôt mind learning the hard way, not just reloading but restarting after you‚Äôve wasted all your money on spells that don‚Äôt work together, then you will love this RPG. Otherwise at least get a guide for character creation and have some fun. "

1786,Gary Ginderhal,188,2,0,"May 14, 2017",Recommended,71.8,"Fantastic gameplay, even in an alpha state. That's the short of it, the long of it is a little more complicated.  This game's got a lot to offer even in an extremely unfinished state as it is, and I'll probably change my review when the next story segment comes out and likely again when the game's released as a finished product. As it stands, without voices, with missing dialogue, with missing assets, and occasional bugs, this is still a beautiful game that, while short, offers some pretty in-depth character customization, even up to level 8 or 9.   The elemental effect/terrain altering magic from the first game is back, and better than ever, with a few new combinations, as well as the Bless/Curse quasi-elements that can transform an already dangerous fire patch into a lethal Cursed Flame that sets enemies or allies aflame with immolation that can't be put out with water, or transform an annoying but avoidable oil patch into Blessed Oil that fortifies allies instead of slowing them, making it a detour you WANT to walk through for a buff rather than a hindrance to walk around. I constantly found myself wondering how best to use my action points to turn terrain to my advantage rather than simply cluttering up the field with dangerous patches of fire, ooze, or electrified water.  Creating characters is even more in-depth than the last game, and many of the old skills from the first game have either been changed or removed for more interesting ones. Summoning is now its own skill tree, and is best paired with spells that create environmental effects, or simply on a Lizard who can breathe a patch of flame wherever they want, as the summons, a totem and an ""Incarnate"" gain the element they're conjured on, either water, fire, poison, oil, or blood. Even with all the spells at my disposal, I still found myself favoring the weapons I'd chosen before, as even with a hundred spells at my disposal, sometimes it's nice to just smack someone with a big sword.  This game can be very, VERY hard, but often in a Dark Souls way. Usually you'll know why you died, and can reload to try to fix it next time. Enemy casting a lot of fire spells? Make sure to purchase a rain scroll or use more water magic to counteract them, or simply stunlock the enemy to death and try to pick apart the enemy's strategy. It's pretty rare that you'll encounter a fight that you simply cannot win when you first encounter it, unless you go into the battle extremely underleveled (If you're more than 1 level below your opponent, you're probably going to lose). Generally fights last a while, so make sure to prepare for both long and short combats as it's rare that you'll go into a fight completely outclassing your opponent, and be prepared to burn potions and the like, as they WILL give you an edge in combat and it's generally not worth trying to tough it out without them. There's apparently an entire mechanic for food, but I've never gotten good results from it and the buffs generally arent worth the action points it takes to eat it, so you can't simply down six cheese wheels to heal to full.  The storyline's not quite as good as the gameplay, sadly, but I'm pretty confident that with voice acting and some tweaks it will get far stronger. The quest journal's still hardly worth looking at unless you've totally forgotten what you've done and feel like looking through a complicated and user-unfriendly transcript of everyone you've ever spoken to. The journal could definitely use a change as it was often hard to maintain who's quests were what and with four characters with FOUR SEPARATE JOURNALS THAT OFTEN HAVE SEPARATE QUESTS it's quite difficult to keep everything straight. Thankfully it's easy to just start walking in a direction and you'll probably run into some enemies that are either your level or much, much higher, leading to a quick-reload and a different path taken. The storyline itself introduces a number of people, Dalis the Hammer, Bishop Alexandar, a blind elven seer, and far, far, FAR more, each with a complex backstory that almost everyone's happy to narrate to you at the drop of a hat, which can get a little overwhelming sometimes, but it's an inherently wordy RPG, so that's just par for the course.  The story's tone is classic Larian, with a serious and epic plot that tries to be grim and po-faced when the rest of the world is made up of goofy talking skulls, riddling rats, mad witches, puns, and adorable dog quest-givers. Although the main storyline ends up looking a little out-of-place, it's nice that it's there and that the game's not simply a permanent comedy routine. I will say that some will find the tone kind of schizophrenic, and although I'd agree with that I'd also say that it's not a game to be taken seriously, and is instead more a sandbox for one or more players can wreak havoc or play within the rules.  Character customization is a little lacking at the moment, but that's almost secondary compared to the great animations each race/gender has, as well as each armor set looking different on each race, with an emphasis on eastern cloth for Lizards, or a hardier iron look for Dwarves. Spells have intricate and impressive effects, even for basic spells such as ""Throw a rock"" or ""hit someone extra hard."" While the hairdos and facial options presented to each race and gender is pretty small, it's generally enough that you probably won't get your characters confused.  On an entirely different note, the game's graphics and representation is amazing. I love the vibrant colors, and beautiful tropical locale for the start of the game. The one big downside is that the first part of the game takes place in a giant prison, but the atmosphere is that of a tropical resort, with sunny skies, beautiful coral beaches, and a shanty-town that looks more like a run-down tourist town than a brutal gulag for wizards. Although it wouldn't be nearly as pretty to look at, it would have been nice to have a more oppressive environment to start in, and escape to the tropical paradise later on, for contrast. That being said, the shadow effects playing off trees and logs, and the drop dead gorgeous beaches make for an impressive opening, and when the future chapters of the game are released, I'll be most excited to see the environments they take place in.  To sum it all up, this game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing fantastic. Worth a look if you enjoy slower-paced RPGs, even though the storyline's only about 1/3rd complete. With almost all of its flaws coming from being an unfinished alpha and very few coming from the actual design or gameplay. Pretty much fun in every aspect, with an insane level of combat and character customization depth, this game is absolutely worth your time."

I rate it better than my favorites Baldurs Gate and Baldurs Gate 2. While I don't give this better marks than Witcher 3 (I mean... seriously I don't see how you could), this title is supremely worthy of purchase to anyone who calls themselves an RPG fan.  I could go on and on about how interesting the character building is in this game, but its probably one of the more frustrating aspects of the title. Their are so many choices, its difficult to fit all of them in, in a single play through. While I do consider their to be some balancing issues between physical/melee and ranged/magic, I do imagine that player mods will one day solve this.  If players committed to making engrossing campaigns (or the developers continued to add-on to this title) I'd be set in my deeply-rooted RPG needs for years to come.  Kudos to them for actually coming up with a storyline that interested me, and wasn't filled with standard fantasy tropes. I really enjoyed this, despite not having completed it yet. This is a magical title and you need to buy it, even if you don't enjoy this particular style of game."
1793,Agarwaen,66,2,0,"November 26, 2017",Recommended,194.2,"If I were to qualify this game with the fewest amount of words possible, I'd say 'Frustratingly addictive'. For a more detailed breakdown, please read below.  The positives: Divinity: Original Sin 2 has an interesting and engaging story. If you play with some of the origin characters, your experience will be even richer.  The game is rendered in a beautiful engine, enriching the expirience even further. The world of Rivellon is very detailed and vast, offerring a lot of opportunities to wonder off the beaten path. Exploration is rewarded with hidden treasure, encounters etc.  Combat really shines with tactical options.  The negatives: For a newcomer to this franchise this game felt really frustrating at times, especially during combat. It seems that most enemies you face have mobility skills and ranged attacks, which your party may lack in the beginning.  Ths story felt really complex and there were cases where I no longer understood which allegiance I should honor.  Overall, I would still recommend anyone who enjoys RPGs to give D:OS 2 a try. Despite some of its flaws it is a solid role playing game.  PS. Is it me, or the UI looks a lot like Diablo 3?"

1798,WMDurant,128,2,0,"October 28, 2017",Recommended,80.0,"This is one of those RPGs that takes the ""Role-Playing"" part seriously. There are so many options to personalize your playthrough that it makes me want to play it 3-4 more times just to see everything. The preset characters are all unique and well developed, each of which come with an extremely intruiging personal questline. The story is easily one of its biggest strengths, as it kept me entralled throughout the entire experience. Another strength of the game is the gameplay itself. The mechanics of the game help build depth both inside and outside of combat. The combat itself is extremely well executed, with battles that can last for over 30 minutes and still be interesting until the very end. This is easily one of the best RPGs to come out in a long time. A must buy for any RPG fan."
1799,Pretoryan,342,2,0,"August 23, 2017",Recommended,347.6,"Let me just say that the game is great, and I enjoyed playing it, these are some problems it has right now, which might get fixed in the future.  - Crafting system/food is useless, even on the highest difficulty.  - Its a bit too much of exactly what Divinity OS was, would have really liked to see more of different spells and combinationsm since bless/curse fire seems to be as useful as the food.  - After act 2, it starts getting really random and the story suffers from lacking any thread. It becomes a series of boss fights until it just ends with a boss fight.    - Certain talents/classes are kind of useless compared to others. Taking bartering is without any meaningful point, because with/without it you will acquire a hoard of gold and be able to steal everything anyway.    But besides that, this game offers a better story, better gameplay and more content than any other in its price range (and above) and will give you a great ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing experience even if you nitpick at whats wrong with it.   Heartly recommended"
1800,Old Man Pizza Tony,124,2,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,127.4,"I have been playing this game since EA last year. Not religiously, mind you. But loading it up after just about every patch and playing Act 1 with my buddy. It has changed a lot since last December, and all of it for the better. I will mostly try to cover the changes since Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition, which I played through several times with a friend on Xbox One. I have not beat this game yet, and I probably won't for another 100+ hours. I am running multiple concurrent playthroughs with several friends and that takes an inordinate amount of time with how I play.  The tone of this game is not vastly different than the orignal, but it is different enough. No more vendors are yelling at you about cheese or entussling scrolls. The supporting cast is overall less goofy. You don't run into an obnoxious Goblin in the player housing and the new supporting cast is about 20x more interesting, despite the slightly more serious tone. The voice acting is stellar and a major surprise that it even happened at all, considering the vast amount of dialogue. Every character feels distinct and makes me want to talk to them. There are plenty of funny little dialogue throwbacks to weird little things that happened in the first game. From a talking skull in the very first area, a Dragon Commander character in Act 1, being scolded for looking for needles in haystacks, to references to Arhu in a random book 99% of players will never read. The narrator's voice is on point with inflection and appropriate humour for every dialogue option so far. I seriously cannot state how amazing the voice actors are in this game. There are just as many jokes and funny choices in this game as the first, neat sidequests, and funny names abound. They are just more in line with the slightly more serious tone of this game. The companions don't have absurd names like Bairdotr, but they are still colorful and interesting. They have their own goals and interact with the game world in very different ways.   Combat is infintely improved. High ground is decisive in victory, range combat is king, and making pure physical/magic builds is necessary for CC'ing high level enemies. No more RNG exists for crowd controlling enemies. It is based on depletable magical and physical armor. The armor values do not regenerate without special skills, but if you are making a solid build, there are ways to replenish this. The AI is smarter and know to avoid retribution builds, to target high DPS weak characters, and path around ground hazards. They pull neat tricks that only a player would have done in DoS:1. They set up combos turns in advance and enemy parties have really good synergy. Despite all this, the combat feels fair. They work within the confines of the game and the skills are very well explained. If you find your build is lackluster, that is fine, respeccing is free and readily available in Act 2. The build diversity is insane. Splashing for utility is extremely viable and necessary. Pure builds work in almost all encounters. I love the fact that everything but Rogue is usable. Memory is a huge cahnge, you can learn every single skill that your stats allow, but cannot put them on your bar unless you have enough memory slots to learn the skills. This does restrict how many spells you can use at once, but it is also balanced and the whole game is built around it. this is not a bad change, but it is a major one.  The biggest and best change is the removal of crafting as a skill. Anyone can utilize materials found without having to waste valuable points. Stealing art is still a valuable way to make money. I don't know how anyone could even play this game without a dedicated thief character. The game is not Skyrim, you simply cannot do everything in one playthrough. So many choices will fully lock you out of dialogue trees or quests. Not in a restrictive way, but in a lore-friendsly and realistic way.   If you want an RPG that has stellar combat, engaging dialogue, and love lots of reading, this game is for you. This game is not for everyone, and just because it wasn't made for you, does not mean this game is not a masterpiece."

So far I've put 45 hours into the D:OS 2 and I'm playing on tactitian mode and I'm far from beating it but from everything I've seen so far this game further enhances and polishes the experience from the first game. I have zero complaints, this game is basically perfection. I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in the genre. It's a mechanicaly deep rpg with a great cast of characters, lore and combat. The game doesn't hold your hand and the story and quests unfold naturally. This isn't a game to rush through, you'll find the most joy out of it if you take your time and explore the world it has to offer.

1824,Draenei For Life (Josh),239,2,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,105.4,"GAME OF THE YEAR FOR ME. ALSO if you play this game keep the black cat alive, trust me its so worth it.   SO the good things about this game: The story/writing has vastly been improved saince the first game, I loved the first one but the story never really pulled me in, this one however pulls me in within the first hour. The combat is still as fun and tactical as the first, with far more combinations of spells and abilities (plus waaayyy more spells, classes and abilities in general). The character creation is fun, its not too long and crazy but allows you to make (or customize an existing character) to be the character you wanna play. The companions are all detailed with decent stories and they all have different impacts on the storyline and each other. Gamemaster Mode is incredible fun, it feels like the D&D campaign creator I've always wanted. This game has up to 4 player multiplayer for the full game, so if you have the friends jump into this with them.   Few neutral things: The music is kind of average, a few fun tunes but feels generic. The crafting system is no longer a cluster of confusing rubbish, so its not a negative, it still doesn't feel very important though, on my solo playthrough and playthrough with friend we both ignore it as it feels still not that useful. Arena mode is a rare giggle but feels kind of incomplete. While its very true many quests allow you to do them  in different ways which is fab, some of them matter little, you will be given like 5 options (if you find them all) to finish a certain part however, you can just run back and do the other options for extra xp for killing them (as I do) making the choice slightly pointless.  Bad things for me (or things I think others will hate): The amount of races is fun (including undead versions), however, it feels like every race is here in vast quantities, no race feels rarer. If you do not like turn based combat this game is NOT FOR YOU AT ALL. Your characters pathing when you tell them to go someone in a fight will still decide to  casually run through fire/poison etc, or sometimes attacks of opportunity make ZERO sense. Gamemaster Mode has no way of making character talk, its all up to the GM. Now this last comment is something that just personally annoys me, but when you need to  help a character in a fight (or save them) they have this tendency to just go full in and take huge quantities of damage, they seem to have dumb AI compared to actual enemies.  I hope my review gave some insight on whether to purchase this game."

1829,Nethys/BlackViking,335,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,80.9,"The Co-op is pretty fantastic, with split screen and online gameplay available. 4-player Co-op is huge, especially when each character has their own backstories, motives, and alignments. Some quests mean you gotta talk to someone, someone else may want that person dead. Sometimes you even gotta fight your friends in a fun arena-style system. Combat is amazing, especially when you have the turn-based gameplay to help stage brutal combos to dispatch multiple enemies. From exploiting elements, to staging ambushes for the enemy you just turned into a chicken, the options are vast. Story so far is pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing good. As I stated initially, everyone has their own upbringings and goals that sometimes conflict or align at various parts of the plot. While the beginning of the game seems very linear (""We gotta get out of this place!"") The variety of methods and questlines to accomplish that is guaranteed to bring in a second playthrough. I recommend this game to people who enjoy co-op gameplay, intricate stories, or just solid fantasy RPGs; this game has been a hit on all fronts for me and it feels good to play a sequel that just comes out better than the previous game.

I highly suggest you play coop because the dimension it adds to the game is so much fun as you and friend(s) just run into all the quirks and silliness. Every fight can be one if you just switch it up and try out new tactics.. or just get lucky! The amount of details and love put into this game makes AAA companies look like indie developers.  The game is not without its flaws, the crafting is shallower than it can be, some armors/weapons never would have a use in someone who wants to win, misclicking on things in battle can really mess up a long fight and turn the tide negatively and the rest is mainly just nit-picky stuff.   Overall this game is a solid product, it looks nice, it plays nice and its completely mastered the art of an rpg in a sandboxm, meaning you have rules and tools, but you can often abuse or mess around and accomplish things in interesting ways. This game is worth the cover charge and should be a no-brainer if you are on the fence and it is on sale!"

The things happening in this game are so well written, exquisitly described, the love scenes are just amazing to read. And you will hate, you will hate a lot of characters and you will wait hours and hours to be finally able to fight them and it will feel like revenge. You will curse in front of your PC, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you! die! eat this you piece of‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• BURN! Yeah, it is like that. Its an emotional game, talk to your characters, love them, hate them, see them evolve.  You will not believe the skill progress in this game, what you can become during this game... it will be sutil, slow,  but at some point it you will realize how terrifyingly powerful you are. And it feels good. And the game is still hard, battles are long and tactical. You can still die, but damn you can put up a fight. And the ending... amazing, Its very satisfying. You will not be dissapointed. It has its bugs and some uncompleted quests but nothing serious.  Enjoy amazing writing, amazing story, and amazing characters. It ended and all i have is an aplause.

A Lone Wolf Rogue who steal everyone but help those in need. A Noble Ranger Elf travel with Sebille. A Necromancer who I still don't know what to do with her. An Elf Ranger who I play Co-op with my friend.  A Fighter already out of Fort joy, A Noble Ranger Elf running around try to fine everything that we can do in Fort joy.

I didn't go far because I want to try to build a different class and see how they perform, I also wanna know what Fort Joy have to offer, and I enjoy it a lot...  Bewarn This game doesn't tell you what to do, this for some are bad... but for me, I believe others will love it. Don't know what to do? Ask around and you will find interesting side quest, and some hint of something bigger outside...This make discover more reward, no quest marker to make you feel like you're stupid or lazy quest writer who don't have to write a good paragraph because quest marker already done the job.  Reading also be negative for some, I'm Thai and English is my 2nd-language but still have trouble with it yet.  Gameplay Combat is turnbase which sadly turn others away... But believe me...This is Deep and every fastify Turn-Base game, making combo with class build, party and your surrounding make a turnbase game yet every dynamic and good gameplay.  Graphic is so beatiful,  magics and skills are very well presented  Sound/Audio is very well done  especially theme song...I love it  Performance Quite good 60+fps even thought Turnbase gameplay's FPS isn't that important...

Your guy who can grow wings and fly around the battlefield can do this just as easily out of combat.  Leads to feeling free when exploring around.  Ever play an rpg where you wonder why your party sits and listens to the villain monologue and then lets him take the first shot?  You can do that, or you can shoot first.  You can shoot (almost) anyone first.  You monster.  Combat is turn based and you can pull off some fairly genius moves, cheese tactics, and many things in between.

I won't be going into details, you can read that from a bunch of other reviews, but i'll just meantion one seriously annoying flaw: Quests not closing properly.  You'll come across 20-30'ish quests during this game, that, even though you complete them, won't successfully close in your journal - they will be closed as if you failed them or diddnt follow them to the end after moving on the the next chapter. This is super frustrating in a heavely storydriven RPG.  However, this is really the only major flaw i can think of. Sure, theres some minor annoynces, like the trading and inventory UI, but you'll get used to them.  Big thumps up, and big improvement over DOS 1."

1854,jenn_geoffroy,182,2,0,October 2,Recommended,245.1,"I play RPGs for the story. I play strategy games for the tactical puzzles. In RPGs, the combat is (at best) an okay distraction between story points, and if there's a role-playing way to avoid a fight, I'll usually take it. In strategy games, the story is a thin trope-ridden veneer I mostly ignore.  Then along comes the DOS games. The only RPGs with a story I really really WANT to finish, alongside fights I will make a detour to take on. I'll still avoid fights with persuasion and roleplaying when I can, because I like the immersion and playing a clever character, but in DOS2, I'll loop back after obtaining my objective, plant as many barrels of oil and ooze I can find next to the enemy I conned into letting me run around, and then light them up like a roman candle before taking them down.  There's some good funny moments. Some gory creepy moments. Some really really hard moments (yikes, the crucial reveal in Lohse's story GUTTED me - it even gutted the hard-case who was guiding me on that quest, that's saying something as to how heartwrenching a choice needs to be made). And there's moments when you finally kill someone who's been irritating you for awhile by turning him into a chicken before giving him a final whack and shouting IN YOUR FACE as he explodes or something.

Combat is deep and cinematic, both punishing and rewarding. Your party has their own fascinating stories and personalities, and the world your playing in feels chaotic and on the brink of complete anarchy. Its shaping up to be an excellent game, Im already finding myself both wanting more, and eagerly awaiting the September 14th release.

Over the last year I have peaked in and out to see what Larian Studios added and/or removed. To my surprise, every time I took a peak the world, characters, game mechanics, and story were all better than the last time I played.   Now that we are at release, I can say with the utmost certainty that Larian Studios has done a masterful job. Though I am only in Fort Joy, the level of polish and player choice is unlike anything I have played in recent memory. This is a studio that deserves recognition as not only did they keep all of the promises they made during their kickstarter campaign, but they also added so much more (Voice Acting, All Undead Races, Controller Support).  Congratulations, Larian Studios. You were amongst my top developers before this, and based on what I have played, you may have caught up to CD Projekt Red. Well done!"
1868,jkr000,40,2,0,"November 8, 2017",Recommended,327.6,"Arguably the best RPG I've played. No Micro transactions or any additional fees to play. Best when playing with another player (up to 3 additional players). Tons of lore, story, and ways to deal with most situations. Lots of freedom in how you want to play the game.   Downside is that combat isn't as frequent and leveling does tend to be on the slower side. You'll spend more time gearing up or chatting than doing anything else. Enemies, in general, are on the weaker side, so sometimes combat doesn't feel as rewarding.   Fun moments: -Trying to break into the ship's kitchen ends with the entire ship blowing up. -Battling asssassins in one motel room, while listening to npcs in another room talk about their love life.  -The moment my cousin and I realize the food we've been eating was made of the local law enforcement that continues to go missing.  -The moment my cousin and I realize what the gods were planning leading to a an epic betrayal of all betrayals.  -Failing to save a family from an execution leading to all out war in the oil fields.  -Realizing the badguys at the end had a very reasonable endgame to their scheme that would have led to the best kind of ending you could get in the game.  -Having my cousin backstab me as I attempt to take Divinity for myself (I won't forget this cuz. I hope you enjoy all those arrows in your face.).   Overall the experience was enjoyable. I cannot wait for a sequel to this game."

In this game all those minor/big issues I had with the series is gone.  One of my favorite things about this game is all the dialog options and more are available depending on your race, and tags. The random things you can do and play with your own style to pass are just amazing and leave me with a complete immersive feeling at all times. I'm still in the tutorial zone at nearly 9 hours because im taking it nice and slow while reading all that dialog. A somewhat early review but I've already noticed ALL my nitpicks from the first game have been addressed in this game.  Major improvements that I love from the last game: + More Dialog choices + Recruiting any new member gives you the choice to select their class allowing for a party of your choice as well + Selling an item worth a lot of money gives you quick reputation with traders + Killing someone in town away from everyone doesn't make the entire world hate you in this game + New Classes/Undead! + Very informative tutorial + New armor/movement/combat system that feels perfected for turn based + Inventory enhancements making it really easy to deal with all party members quickly + Co-op + 4 Players + Crafting"

1871,Chris,273,2,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,131.8,"Bang up ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing game. Seriously, best RPG in many, MANY years. I haven't ever really reviewed a game before, so I'm going to give it my best shot. This game is about as close to DND on a digital medium that you can get while still being its own game. Fully interactive environment, (tons of fire, electricuting water, exploding oil and poison) and the developers really played with it.  Just a small spoiler alert, but to just put it in perspective how the environment comes into play. There's one fight pretty far into the game on top of a mountain of wreckage. Out of absolutely nowhere, tons of oily blobs come to kill you. Every time you damage them, and they move, they spread oil. So the whole time, you're trying to batter them down as you move up the mountain to get away from them. The dev's then have it to where when the oily guys finally go down, TONS of fire guys show up and ignite all the oil. I know its kinda hard to get it across, but fighting ontop of this giant mound with fire everywhere trying to batter down the fiery slimes, seriously felt cool.   Character creation wise, I mean it's pretty good. Not a ton of customization, just standard face 1, 2, 3, etc. But honestly not a big deal. As you develop what your character is good at, you grow to love em.  Classes are pointless, you build your character the way YOU want to, so they can literally become anything. I've got a few characters going, and all feel super unique and diverse. A dwarven rogue shapeshifter who can grow a tentacle arm and smack people around as well as shed all enemies magical resistances to support, I've got a fire slinging geomancer who uses oil‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to explode just about everyone, and I've got a necromancer archer who summons tons of undead corpses to explode all over people. It all feels super unique and fun to play. There's times where I miss my other characters, hop on them to play, and then miss the one I was just playing. Kinda neat.  If you want my advice, 100+ hours advice, PLAY WITH FRIENDS. Preferrably in person. Hit up an old school lan party feel, bring cpu's over, build a SUPER diverse cast of characters, and hunker down. Pizza and beer obviously. Plan for an all nighter, because I literally PROMISE you you'll be playing til 6am EASY. I haven't personally had a game grab me like that in many years, and god damn its a good feeling to have back. Go larian, you guys are the men and women making games great again.  10/10."

1873,Greendetective,47,2,0,"April 30, 2017",Recommended,127.9,I was very skeptical about this game.  How can a top down SRPG not be boring?  But after some persuasion from a friend i finally decided to buy it and play it with them and lo' and behold i was astounded by how fun this game is.  The puzzles and battles are the most strategic and amazing srpg battles I seen with environmental destruction being an awesome gimmick. The story is simple yet effective with a huge world with plenty to do and graphics are amazingly beutiful.  I was never bored playing it.  It will be amazing to see this game get finished and voice acting added(which is in the orginal Divinity).  But for an early access it does give you a good taste of the game and you can tell the finished product will be great.
1874,Moogie,171,2,0,"September 25, 2017",Recommended,97.9,"Loved the first game, despite its flaws. I feel like this game fixes every issue the first game had and across the board improves on it - my hat off to Larian Studios for listening to feedback.   While the story and setting is darker, there is so much humor sprinkled into this game. With the addition of voice acting, I find myself listening to everything. I didn't know how to feel about the narration at first, but it has grown on me and I feel like it's a great addition to the game. The Origin stories are a neat touch, I am doing my first playthrough as Lohse and I feel like mine is the most interesting of the group. Definitely want to try Fane next.  Overall, its a beautiful game with great little details hidden everywhere. (Also the music is great)  I have a hard time coming up with any real criticisms of the game, but I will try. I wish there was a better loot system - i play ranged and I just never get to loot anything, which isn't very fun. Some of the quests I've run into were bugged, so that's a bummer but I'm sure they'll be fixed in the near future and I can do them on my Tactician playthrough. I feel like playing with 4 people pulls the game into too many directions, I miss stuff that other people are doing and everyone wants to have the feeling of exploration - that's not really a game flaw, I just think it'd be a better experience with 1-2 players."
1875,Jentleman Jack,39,2,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,63.2," This game was just godly, the choices, the dialogue, exploration and combat.  The story, or stories more like, was truly engaging as was building a connection with the characters.  And with the choices to create my own, I did just that, an avatar to interact with the world set together by the true gods.  I quite enjoy the presence of sophisticated types regardless of how rude they may be, along with my affinity for lizard-like races, chose to be a blue ocean in the form of a lithe lizard, who with a mixture of bow and magic, controlled my enemies, and aided my allies.  On my journy was my three companions who have more than proved their friendship.   To begin was the vocals of the group, Lohse who with her mastery of summoning, most disconcerning interest in electrocution along with her words of encouragement(and madness) made for a friend worth staying in the back with and babying the rough'n'tough boys when they've had too much of a spanking.   Then theres the Beast who, in-spite of being quite short, excelled at movement, cutting down enemies as quickly as knocking them onto their‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and with being a dwarf and a pirate no less, was enthusiastic, joyous and free as a dwarven pirate should be, whilst Lohse was the voice to the song, the Beast would always be the first to sing along.   And last, but definitely no least was the understandably arrogant Red Prince, tamer of flames, a true beefcake to my slender form, and as brutal with the shield as he is with his sword.  And somewhere along the lines his ""Fire"" met my ""Water"" and together created steam if you know what I mean, sure he was destined to another, but this here was the closest thing to true love.  Hm, but how far exactly did that ""love"" go, if you catch my meaning, meh, a fan-fiction to keep to my own.   But the hardest part about all of this, the story, your companions, was saying goodbye in the end, to say, this is it.  To end the journey and part ways with those of which you have made it so far with was quite heart wrenching.  I almost didn't want to say goodbye, but a story has to end.  For me, I would have wanted to keep playing after the epilogue, to be a god and explore the world as a one-lizard band.  Maybe even return to the Ancient Empire, see how everything fares with the Red Prince, share a few drinks, and reminisce upon our old adventures.  Perhaps we even get the whole gang together for another adventure, just like good old times.  But to say goodbye, to say goodbye was so hard, to part ways with friends, those who have been together with you through so much, is always hard, and sometimes, imagination alone isn't enough to mend the emptiness filled by adventures, especially ones with those you have melded with.    I guess this is more a tale rather than an actual review, or perhaps it is a review in the shape of a tale but even with the very small flaws in this diamond, I shall cherish this game for what it accomplishes.  A good story, a world full of surprises and secrets, and a band of friends I would forever play god with til' the end.  But I demand nothing more from Larian studios for they have made their sacrifices to deliver something no triple A game developer could get quite right.  I shall see to it that I myself create new adventures, because with the tools Larian has provided, we can all become story tellers, and we can all be pathfinders for our own adventures. -10/10 ...Would definitely adventure again."

1878,pinkpinnn,248,2,0,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,122.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 - 2017 GEM.  Finding a game that mixes RPG, D&D, customizable class/ characters, good story telling, beautiful aesthetics, crafting system, tactical turn based battle, and option to play co-op? This game pretty much offers it all up on a silver plate.  I've played the first Divinity Original Sin, and my impression of that wasn't so strong, however I decided to give this a try, and it definitely floored me.  None too many games I've played have done a swell job in buffing lores, stories, and open ended quests for you to explore. You don't have to be a lore-lover or a rouge type gamer to enjoy this. There's a sweet spot for everyone. I went looking for a plain old adventure-with-consequences game, and spent more time reading up short lores here and there instead of speeding through it.  I can't believe I've spent 80+ hours (solo play) and still haven't completed it yet. Actually for the first chapter, I managed to spend 8-9 hours (and this was just purely exploring and figuring out quests). Halfway through the game, it even conjured up my nostalgia for Dragon Age 1.   CONS/ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  -Sometimes there are NO warnings before huge consequences take place. And when it happens, it's too late to alter (unless you are bothered to load up a game save 1 hour ago+). This happened a few times for me, the most painful one for me being: I couldn't take my companions to the next chapter because I'd missed that one window to convince them. They were absolutely gone. I loaded a previous save, but ever since that happened, I ended up tracking quests on wikia instead in fear of a major slip up -Quest journals are sometimes vague, and you will be left wondering or wiki-ing what the next step should be -Some quests feel un-finished or un-polished, as there may only be ONE, OBSCURE way of completing it -Not a must, but nice to have: Camera angle needs more rotation flexibility -No option to hide the HUD  PROS:  -The battle system constantly makes you look for the best spots to prepare and engage. Whenever you think you've got your ""go-to"" strategies nailed down, the game manages to switch it up just a little to make it challenging (+fun) again -Attention to detail towards the environment and the overall atmosphere. I don't always stop and look at the shadows of leaves and trees in a game. Each chapter is a map with it's own characteristics -Memorable background sound and music <3 Well done Borislav Slavov  -EVERY character has a voice! And voice acting is just ace -Main companions have decent back stories, although 1 or 2 still seem like pompous ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s after 20 hours -HIGH replayability value -Co-op offers extra fun if you want play with you rmates, and most things work smoothly. Just take note of the connectivity menu, and make sure to set your game privacy, as random people can enter your game and hijack your acharacter completely. -Dungeon master mode! For those who are into D&D this might be an interesting mode to check out  TO THINK THIS GAME WAS BACKED BY A KICK STARTER AND DEVELOPED + LAUNCHED UNDER 3 YEARS!  It's not easy balancing and taking in multiple opinions and ideas and delivering on something this decent. I suspect good team work somewhere in Larian Studios. The game is decent enough for me to overlook the annoying flaws (for now). And major game developing companies? You guys better brush up your A game. Top notch graphics aren't the only thing that makes a game immersive and great.  ANYWAYS...JUST...Just ..go play it!"

Would recommend it for the solid single player RPG that it is but as a Co-op RPG. It is unsurpassed by any game.  Would recommend it to anyone, especially if they have friends to co-op it with."
1885,tigran_petrosjan,42,2,0,"August 26, 2017",Recommended,875.2,"This game has the potential to become a masterpiece. It has all the strenghts of the first game`s Enhanced Edition, offers turn-based combat and plenty elemental interactions (make it rain, aoe stun through blitz bolt - create a fire surface, throw poison onto it for a huge explosion etc.). You can play with up to four party members and can either create your own character or take one of the four (after full release six) pre-made characters. While the first game lacked in the story, this 2nd part is much better in this regard. It has a much darker tone and so far the story delivers fully. It is grim, entertaining and really complex. Also the possibility of party dialogue and getting different results when talking with different party members to certain NPCs enlagerns its richness in this regard. But the strogest point of Divinity Origial Sin has always been its combat system. And the second part adds more features to that and makes everything even better. You now have aroumr fore physical and magic damage, which you have to break first in order to inflict status elements like stunned or burning or knocked down. Also there is a height system now, that your ranged characters can use for greater range and more damage.  And last but not least the game has after the full release on the 14th of September a Game Master Mode. There you can basically develop and play your own adventures with the Divinity engine and UI. With this you can create your own D&D - campaign and play it with your friends.  Another small feature is the Arena Mode, where you can explore the combat system with pre-defined characters on several maps. All this features offer easy access to multiplayer, I have atm ver 250 hours into this already great game and multiplayer worked fine every time. I regard Divinity Original Sin 2 in the highest order. This game was highly enjoyable already in its year in Early Access although it missed some of its features. Full release is now only two weeks away and if you like calssic RPGs which give you a challenging gameplay, try this game out.

1899,Old Man Pizza Tony,124,2,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,127.4,"I have been playing this game since EA last year. Not religiously, mind you. But loading it up after just about every patch and playing Act 1 with my buddy. It has changed a lot since last December, and all of it for the better. I will mostly try to cover the changes since Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition, which I played through several times with a friend on Xbox One. I have not beat this game yet, and I probably won't for another 100+ hours. I am running multiple concurrent playthroughs with several friends and that takes an inordinate amount of time with how I play.  The tone of this game is not vastly different than the orignal, but it is different enough. No more vendors are yelling at you about cheese or entussling scrolls. The supporting cast is overall less goofy. You don't run into an obnoxious Goblin in the player housing and the new supporting cast is about 20x more interesting, despite the slightly more serious tone. The voice acting is stellar and a major surprise that it even happened at all, considering the vast amount of dialogue. Every character feels distinct and makes me want to talk to them. There are plenty of funny little dialogue throwbacks to weird little things that happened in the first game. From a talking skull in the very first area, a Dragon Commander character in Act 1, being scolded for looking for needles in haystacks, to references to Arhu in a random book 99% of players will never read. The narrator's voice is on point with inflection and appropriate humour for every dialogue option so far. I seriously cannot state how amazing the voice actors are in this game. There are just as many jokes and funny choices in this game as the first, neat sidequests, and funny names abound. They are just more in line with the slightly more serious tone of this game. The companions don't have absurd names like Bairdotr, but they are still colorful and interesting. They have their own goals and interact with the game world in very different ways.   Combat is infintely improved. High ground is decisive in victory, range combat is king, and making pure physical/magic builds is necessary for CC'ing high level enemies. No more RNG exists for crowd controlling enemies. It is based on depletable magical and physical armor. The armor values do not regenerate without special skills, but if you are making a solid build, there are ways to replenish this. The AI is smarter and know to avoid retribution builds, to target high DPS weak characters, and path around ground hazards. They pull neat tricks that only a player would have done in DoS:1. They set up combos turns in advance and enemy parties have really good synergy. Despite all this, the combat feels fair. They work within the confines of the game and the skills are very well explained. If you find your build is lackluster, that is fine, respeccing is free and readily available in Act 2. The build diversity is insane. Splashing for utility is extremely viable and necessary. Pure builds work in almost all encounters. I love the fact that everything but Rogue is usable. Memory is a huge cahnge, you can learn every single skill that your stats allow, but cannot put them on your bar unless you have enough memory slots to learn the skills. This does restrict how many spells you can use at once, but it is also balanced and the whole game is built around it. this is not a bad change, but it is a major one.  The biggest and best change is the removal of crafting as a skill. Anyone can utilize materials found without having to waste valuable points. Stealing art is still a valuable way to make money. I don't know how anyone could even play this game without a dedicated thief character. The game is not Skyrim, you simply cannot do everything in one playthrough. So many choices will fully lock you out of dialogue trees or quests. Not in a restrictive way, but in a lore-friendsly and realistic way.   If you want an RPG that has stellar combat, engaging dialogue, and love lots of reading, this game is for you. This game is not for everyone, and just because it wasn't made for you, does not mean this game is not a masterpiece."

The origin characters all have interesting stories and it's fun to reveal them. I also liked the main story more than the one from D:OS. Graphics are fine, the soundtrack is great.   The round based combat sometimes requires patience, especially with larger groups and enemies who are able to charm or cripple your characters. But it works. There are still some bugs which hopefully will be fixed over time."

1910,jkr000,40,2,0,"November 8, 2017",Recommended,327.6,"Arguably the best RPG I've played. No Micro transactions or any additional fees to play. Best when playing with another player (up to 3 additional players). Tons of lore, story, and ways to deal with most situations. Lots of freedom in how you want to play the game.   Downside is that combat isn't as frequent and leveling does tend to be on the slower side. You'll spend more time gearing up or chatting than doing anything else. Enemies, in general, are on the weaker side, so sometimes combat doesn't feel as rewarding.   Fun moments: -Trying to break into the ship's kitchen ends with the entire ship blowing up. -Battling asssassins in one motel room, while listening to npcs in another room talk about their love life.  -The moment my cousin and I realize the food we've been eating was made of the local law enforcement that continues to go missing.  -The moment my cousin and I realize what the gods were planning leading to a an epic betrayal of all betrayals.  -Failing to save a family from an execution leading to all out war in the oil fields.  -Realizing the badguys at the end had a very reasonable endgame to their scheme that would have led to the best kind of ending you could get in the game.  -Having my cousin backstab me as I attempt to take Divinity for myself (I won't forget this cuz.

In this game all those minor/big issues I had with the series is gone.  One of my favorite things about this game is all the dialog options and more are available depending on your race, and tags. The random things you can do and play with your own style to pass are just amazing and leave me with a complete immersive feeling at all times. I'm still in the tutorial zone at nearly 9 hours because im taking it nice and slow while reading all that dialog. A somewhat early review but I've already noticed ALL my nitpicks from the first game have been addressed in this game.  Major improvements that I love from the last game: + More Dialog choices + Recruiting any new member gives you the choice to select their class allowing for a party of your choice as well + Selling an item worth a lot of money gives you quick reputation with traders + Killing someone in town away from everyone doesn't make the entire world hate you in this game + New Classes/Undead! + Very informative tutorial + New armor/movement/combat system that feels perfected for turn based + Inventory enhancements making it really easy to deal with all party members quickly + Co-op + 4 Players + Crafting"
1912,Lobster Dominance Hierarchy,30,2,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,364.3,"Great game! The Larian team has done it again. I'm happy for them, especially considering the studios history when they were taken advantage of in the past. I particularly like the shout outs and throwbacks to the DOS1, and I'm no where near done the game yet. If you are wanting a role playing strategy game where you actually interact with your companions, and who have their own motives/goals then this is the game for you.  Pros: - More skills. Dear God the old game was lacking in skill variety, really noticable late game. Good to see they improved this. - Diologue is great! - Lore is great! - Deatail in game world - Humor, and a at times snarky narrator - Different ways of solving a quest  Pro/Con: - Graphicks are amazing as ever, but lag the heck out of your computer when you are in the forest/city and not in a building - Crafting is more streamlined but waaaay harder when experimenting as it's less straightforward as DOS1. Good/bad I don't know.  Cons: - Still a little bugy/brocken quests. Nothing too serious as there is ushally a work around. But I came accross my first broken quest bug in Act 2, as in no way to start it as item didn't appear in inventory. Also the game sometimes crashes, so be sure to save often, especially if you open up a new window to google something.  So there you have it a great game, and dare I say if the studio waited a month to release the game to fix these bugs the game may have even been called immaculate? Hope it gets some more patches soon!  EDIT: A little deeper into the game and a little saltier at some of the bugs, *cough* tarquin *cough* as I found a few more broken quest bugs. This game is definitely released a month too early. Still a great game... just waiting on some more patches..."

1917,Gary Ginderhal,188,2,0,"May 14, 2017",Recommended,71.8,"Fantastic gameplay, even in an alpha state. That's the short of it, the long of it is a little more complicated.  This game's got a lot to offer even in an extremely unfinished state as it is, and I'll probably change my review when the next story segment comes out and likely again when the game's released as a finished product. As it stands, without voices, with missing dialogue, with missing assets, and occasional bugs, this is still a beautiful game that, while short, offers some pretty in-depth character customization, even up to level 8 or 9.   The elemental effect/terrain altering magic from the first game is back, and better than ever, with a few new combinations, as well as the Bless/Curse quasi-elements that can transform an already dangerous fire patch into a lethal Cursed Flame that sets enemies or allies aflame with immolation that can't be put out with water, or transform an annoying but avoidable oil patch into Blessed Oil that fortifies allies instead of slowing them, making it a detour you WANT to walk through for a buff rather than a hindrance to walk around. I constantly found myself wondering how best to use my action points to turn terrain to my advantage rather than simply cluttering up the field with dangerous patches of fire, ooze, or electrified water.  Creating characters is even more in-depth than the last game, and many of the old skills from the first game have either been changed or removed for more interesting ones. Summoning is now its own skill tree, and is best paired with spells that create environmental effects, or simply on a Lizard who can breathe a patch of flame wherever they want, as the summons, a totem and an ""Incarnate"" gain the element they're conjured on, either water, fire, poison, oil, or blood. Even with all the spells at my disposal, I still found myself favoring the weapons I'd chosen before, as even with a hundred spells at my disposal, sometimes it's nice to just smack someone with a big sword.  This game can be very, VERY hard, but often in a Dark Souls way. Usually you'll know why you died, and can reload to try to fix it next time. Enemy casting a lot of fire spells? Make sure to purchase a rain scroll or use more water magic to counteract them, or simply stunlock the enemy to death and try to pick apart the enemy's strategy. It's pretty rare that you'll encounter a fight that you simply cannot win when you first encounter it, unless you go into the battle extremely underleveled (If you're more than 1 level below your opponent, you're probably going to lose). Generally fights last a while, so make sure to prepare for both long and short combats as it's rare that you'll go into a fight completely outclassing your opponent, and be prepared to burn potions and the like, as they WILL give you an edge in combat and it's generally not worth trying to tough it out without them. There's apparently an entire mechanic for food, but I've never gotten good results from it and the buffs generally arent worth the action points it takes to eat it, so you can't simply down six cheese wheels to heal to full.  The storyline's not quite as good as the gameplay, sadly, but I'm pretty confident that with voice acting and some tweaks it will get far stronger. The quest journal's still hardly worth looking at unless you've totally forgotten what you've done and feel like looking through a complicated and user-unfriendly transcript of everyone you've ever spoken to. The journal could definitely use a change as it was often hard to maintain who's quests were what and with four characters with FOUR SEPARATE JOURNALS THAT OFTEN HAVE SEPARATE QUESTS it's quite difficult to keep everything straight. Thankfully it's easy to just start walking in a direction and you'll probably run into some enemies that are either your level or much, much higher, leading to a quick-reload and a different path taken. The storyline itself introduces a number of people, Dalis the Hammer, Bishop Alexandar, a blind elven seer, and far, far, FAR more, each with a complex backstory that almost everyone's happy to narrate to you at the drop of a hat, which can get a little overwhelming sometimes, but it's an inherently wordy RPG, so that's just par for the course.  The story's tone is classic Larian, with a serious and epic plot that tries to be grim and po-faced when the rest of the world is made up of goofy talking skulls, riddling rats, mad witches, puns, and adorable dog quest-givers. Although the main storyline ends up looking a little out-of-place, it's nice that it's there and that the game's not simply a permanent comedy routine. I will say that some will find the tone kind of schizophrenic, and although I'd agree with that I'd also say that it's not a game to be taken seriously, and is instead more a sandbox for one or more players can wreak havoc or play within the rules.  Character customization is a little lacking at the moment, but that's almost secondary compared to the great animations each race/gender has, as well as each armor set looking different on each race, with an emphasis on eastern cloth for Lizards, or a hardier iron look for Dwarves. Spells have intricate and impressive effects, even for basic spells such as ""Throw a rock"" or ""hit someone extra hard."" While the hairdos and facial options presented to each race and gender is pretty small, it's generally enough that you probably won't get your characters confused.  On an entirely different note, the game's graphics and representation is amazing. I love the vibrant colors, and beautiful tropical locale for the start of the game. The one big downside is that the first part of the game takes place in a giant prison, but the atmosphere is that of a tropical resort, with sunny skies, beautiful coral beaches, and a shanty-town that looks more like a run-down tourist town than a brutal gulag for wizards. Although it wouldn't be nearly as pretty to look at, it would have been nice to have a more oppressive environment to start in, and escape to the tropical paradise later on, for contrast. That being said, the shadow effects playing off trees and logs, and the drop dead gorgeous beaches make for an impressive opening, and when the future chapters of the game are released, I'll be most excited to see the environments they take place in.  To sum it all up, this game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing fantastic. Worth a look if you enjoy slower-paced RPGs, even though the storyline's only about 1/3rd complete. With almost all of its flaws coming from being an unfinished alpha and very few coming from the actual design or gameplay. Pretty much fun in every aspect, with an insane level of combat and character customization depth, this game is absolutely worth your time."

1922,Nethys/BlackViking,335,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,80.9,"The Co-op is pretty fantastic, with split screen and online gameplay available. 4-player Co-op is huge, especially when each character has their own backstories, motives, and alignments. Some quests mean you gotta talk to someone, someone else may want that person dead. Sometimes you even gotta fight your friends in a fun arena-style system. Combat is amazing, especially when you have the turn-based gameplay to help stage brutal combos to dispatch multiple enemies. From exploiting elements, to staging ambushes for the enemy you just turned into a chicken, the options are vast. Story so far is pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing good. As I stated initially, everyone has their own upbringings and goals that sometimes conflict or align at various parts of the plot. While the beginning of the game seems very linear (""We gotta get out of this place!"") The variety of methods and questlines to accomplish that is guaranteed to bring in a second playthrough. I recommend this game to people who enjoy co-op gameplay, intricate stories, or just solid fantasy RPGs; this game has been a hit on all fronts for me and it feels good to play a sequel that just comes out better than the previous game.

I have found myself stopped playing 2 times and just listening the soundtrack cause i think it might change if i enter other area. This has not happen to me since Final Fantasy 10. -NPCs are really well written and voice acted. I was amazed by Fane, The Red Prince and the Assasin dude in the beginning. Thats my 3 people party btw. -Turn based combat is really good. It is also challenging even on the lowest level on difficulty. -Game looks amazing with max graphic settings. The water makes me wanna jump in there and swim. -Quests and their completion is done really well. Not one quest feels like a chore and there is actually no direct markings on the map on where to go. It might show you a location of a NPC or location but the rest you have to figure out by yourself. Really nice oldschool vibe init. -I have only been out of the tutorial island and it took me 17 hours. I cant imgaine how much content there is for the rest of the game.  Cons: -Battle might be frustrating in the beginning if you are not familiar with the skills. It took me several attemps on several quests on the normal mode until my party was not demolished by the mobs. This is not really a bad thing cause we need more games that makes us learn the gameplay and try our best but i understand it might frustrate some poeple. -Camera. Camera is pain if you try to change the view all the time but you have to do it in order to loot everything. It takes some time to get used to.  Overall this game is really amazing. It gives me this deep athmospere like when i furst used to play Arcanum or Icewind dale. Totally recommended."
1929,Tally,119,2,0,"November 28, 2017",Recommended,42.0,"Pros:  Absolutely epic!  Fantastic story, nicely done turn-based combat, huge character build variety with endless skill combos, beautiful environments & soundtrack.  There are things to see and do in every corner of the world.   ---  Cons: Camera controls are severely lacking.  The game is so beautiful and I can't see most of it because of the awful camera controls.  Quest tracker leaves a lot to be desired.  I feel like when the fate of the world is hanging in the balance and there is much work to be done, your hero should be writing down a bit more detail in their journal.  ""My lizard friend wants me to find a lizard.""  That's it, no detail and pestering your lizard friend yields no additional information.  I'm just supposed to walk around and talk to EVERY npc until I find the right one.  There is a fair amount of back & forth that is starting to feel tedious.   For example: you stumble upon Z location, but in order to progress through the zone you need X item that is found in Y location.  Go to Y location.   In order to progress through Y location and obtain X item, you must travel to B location to do a quest and unlock a special ability. Go to B location to do said quest and obtain the special ability. Return to Y location, obtain X item, return to Z location. Basically every main story quest is like this, maybe it's because it's my first play through and I'm still learning, but it's getting a little repetitive.  At 25 hours in my save game seems to be getting a bit bloated.  I had this game on my mechanical hard drive and it takes a solid 5 minutes to load Reaper's Coast.  It's a bit less on an SSD but still pretty bad.  ---  Despite all of that, I still think that this game is absolutely worth every penny.  I can see myself playing this game for a long time."

1931,audaciousgenre,246,2,0,"October 23, 2017",Recommended,365.8,"One of the most flexible, polished, detailed, and generally enjoyable games I've ever played. If you like RPGs, you should play this game. Easy to pick up, gameplay can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.   Every character and NPC is voice-acted with individual dialogue, even down to the animals wandering around town - I've never encountered two NPCs who said the same thing. This may not sound huge, but it's a subtle effort that makes the entire experience far more immersive than I've seen in a game. For instance, talking to every random person in a town never feels boring or a chore. It's one of many seemingly minor decision by the creators that elevates the polish and feel of the game above other RPGs, and exemplifies the attention to detail put into every aspect of the game.   The mechanics are great, the graphics are great, controls are great, crafting is good (haven't played with it too much yet), music, writing and voice-acting are absolutely top-notch, skill/magic trees are flexible and mean you can essentially turn anyone in your party into whatever you want. Build archers who also summon and buff creatures to fight for you, two-handed-axe-wielding close-combat necromancers, seriously whatever you want.  I love this game - I'm not even halfway through it, but I already want to start another party just to try out new party builds.  Just get it, unless you're on a serious budget, and even then, it's probably worth skimping on groceries or something this month."

If you can manage to get a group of friends together to play this game it is definatly worth it."
1933,Krysle Quinsen,593,2,0,"November 13, 2017",Recommended,110.4,"This game can be co-op up to four players and there is PVP arena mode as well as GM mode. But I never tried it. So it will be an overall review in single player perspective.  The Story is awesome, it's about god and stuff, the writing is exceptional as well as voiceover, which is mostly a narrator style (think Bastion). Dialog choice is a 3rd person rather than a sentence. The plot twist is good, the lore is great and not out of places (most fantasy game that contains gods and magic mostly not explained well.) and are all connected with every character in the game. There's some noticeable rush in writing in the last act, though.  The puzzle is OK, not much pixel-hunting but last act is not that great and might confusing.  The Quest system is well-designed, there's not much hand-holding and marker much and you can literally kill everyone and not break the game. However, quest item can be sold or dropped, be careful about it.  There are 4 playable races in this game, Human, Lizard, Elf, Dwarf, all with their Skeleton version (8 in total) and can be customized, their lore is interested and not that cliche, the design is very exotic for Lizard. However, Elves do have some weird armor and facial but have interesting lore.  The Combat is just good in tactical stuff, this game used the Round-Robin style where you move one character for each turn, who have the highest initiative(speed). Because of this, a lot of thinking will be required whenever you want to burst someone down or set up some potential combo with environment effects using magic. (Oil/Poison + Fire = Burning Ground, Water + Electricity = Electrical Water or perhaps turning Burning into Steam then electrified it? or blessed fire for healing instead?) There's friendly-fire on magic, so be careful not to kill your melee characters. This game used Armor system (think Barrier from shooting game like Mass Effect) where most negative effect only worked when particular armor is depleted. Which IMHO, work better than RNG system in the first game. AI is also meanie, so don't go in blindly or grouped up too much. They're quite smart. There's quite balance issue in the late game, though, where you literally OP, especially with the usage of Source Abilities.  Although The Music isn't composed by Kirill Pokrovsky (RIP) but Borislav Slavov (Crysis Series) is doing a great job also! the theme is very memorizable, The Rivellon Theme is just too good, the combat music is nice (which also based on instrumental selected on character creation), The Battle for Divinity is story climax combat. There's one vocal song too.  Crafting, however, not that useful and a couple of recipes are useful. You might pick up a lot of junk thinking it as crafting mats, only to be used with one common scroll recipe.  This game support Modding, means there will be QoL mod, overhaul or a campaign for you to play. This disables achievement but there's a mod for it.  TL/DR: Looking for a good single/co-op cRPG with exceptional story and lore that is well-connected with awesome races (Lizard <3), a tactical turn-based combat that required a lot of strategies, perhaps just a game OST for your collection, or doing some RP with Game Master mode? then go ahead, full price!  Now, that's the potential GOTY award for 2017. My The ‚ÄúSuspension of Disbelief‚Äù Award.  PS: I don't write a review much, so it might be messy, I'll try to improve or perhaps changes the style."

If you're a fan of cRPG's in any sense (think Baulder's Gate) you will absolutely love this.   The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, the graphics are great, the gameplay is where it REALLY shines. The fights are difficult, the AI is actually smart, and tactician will put your characters through a grinder when you thought you had it down.  At no point in the game did I feel like it was a slog or a chore to get through during my first playthrough, there was always something meaningful I could do. Just one more side quest before the main story, helping out this one person, talking to this one chicken. The story is also very well done, I feel as though I could actually talk to the characters if they were real people, they are fleshed out very well.   Larian is an extremely awesome company, they delayed the release of the game to add in a fully voiced game due to community request. They listen to their customers, apply the feedback properly, and keep them updated. Definitely the best game company out there right now.  The first act is a very good tutorial, the second act builds the world and the story, and act 3 and 4 take the fun of those two and multiply it by 5. I don't have enough good things to say about this game. The only negative is that it has now ruined so many others for me, because they won't be as good as this. Now I'm bored and don't know what else to start playing.   Ratings: Music: 15/10 (seriously the soundtrack is THAT good) Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Difficulty: 10/10 (has difficulties for all levels of players)  Overall it is a top 3 game that I have ever played.

It's really that great if you into RPG stuff. If you not it's the best place to start. If you have friends who would like to play it with you, it will be your GOTY, for sure.  Pros: Great graphics. One of the best fantasy soundtracks in gaming history. Great campaign with funny, intense moments, scary and entertaining moments. Great writing and overall plot. Huge replayability. Awesome tactical combats. Complex and flexible character building. The best implementation of the coop gameplay in all RPGs ever. Game Master mode for those who would like to play with their friends even after the campaign. A great mod tool that allows you do almost anything in the game. If you willing to spend some time off cause. Content in the game for 100+ hours minimum. Arena PVP mode exists.  Cons: The game still has some bugs. Though all great RPGs has and developers are working really hard fixing them. GM mode could have more love. It lacks a lot of crucial features and a lot of things that exist in the game are unavailable. Though mods in the workshop can help with fixing some of them. Arena PVP mode could have even more love.

1960,dep,81,2,0,August 29,Recommended,192.0,"Pros: Great look about the game, an old school isometric style but fully realised in 3D. The amount of detail is crazy, the main maps are large and crammed with objects and details. The sound is excellent and immersive, I‚Äôd guess 95% of dialogue is voiced, the soundtrack is good and sits well in the background. The gameplay is excellent once you know how to play (see cons) and really lets you go wild with combos between your party, using and abusing the environment, and manipulating your enemies. There is a huge variety of ways to play your characters, all without rigid roles or classes, allowing you create something like a Death Knight from warrior and necromancer skills, or Ranger with bow skills and summoning skills. A massive amount of mods to make the game easier or harder or just different. Cons: There is a very steep learning curve. If you don't know, and I mean really know, what you are doing the game can seem like it's just out to annoy you. It's not (mostly), but because of the nature of the combat system the game can swing between impossible and barely a challenge without too much middle ground. The levels can be quite arbitrary in where you can go. The second island for example ranges between level 9 and 15, and you can quite easily wonder into a fight you just have no chance of winning at that time. As the game does it‚Äôs best not to hold your hand, don‚Äôt expect much help from the quests. The massive array of options in playing your character also gives you many more ways to mess up. It might seem like a good idea to make a necromancer tank but you won‚Äôt do enough damage to heal yourself enough, better off going full offensive. If you don‚Äôt mind learning the hard way, not just reloading but restarting after you‚Äôve wasted all your money on spells that don‚Äôt work together, then you will love this RPG. Otherwise at least get a guide for character creation and have some fun. "

1969,Ananoriel,336,2,0,"November 10, 2017",Recommended,76.9,"After 77 hours I finished Divinity Original Sin 2, and it was a blast! Most modern games don't grab my attention that long anymore, but this is one of the few that really keeps on being interesting and enjoyable.   Divinity OS 2 is a cartoonylooking RPG with turnbased elements. You have a big world to explore with your main character and 3 companions. You can build your characters in any way you want, with different talents, skills and stats. And it is fun to try out different party compositions. I ended up with having one ranger, one necromancer/scoundrel, one mage and one polymorph fighter. And there are many other ways to build your party, fitting to your playstyle.  The combat is the thing the game is most appraised about. It is turn based, and you can manipulate the battleground with surfaces from skills or items. And combining them in more powerful effects. For example you can throw oil on the floor to set it on fire. Or you can let it rain, and freeze enemies to death! It has many options and the combat has because of this many different outcomes, multiple techniques are possible. If you find the combat too easy or too hard, you can change the difficulty as well. I played most time on Classic mode, I found that the best balance for me to enjoy the game.  Another good thing about the game is the story, and the quests. You can get quests by talking to NPCs or exploring, and those are stored in your journal. You won't get exact questpointers, but with a little story that enfolds when you do more talking, exploring or fighting. For some people that would be a downside, but I really miss that in games, that you have to play the game more to find it out instead of running to a pointer and doing what is needed. The story is filled with intriguing characters, a nice pace and many plottwists to keep you awake. The NPCs make the gameworld interesting and feel alive. You can in some situations persuade them with skillchecks, and what you say to them may have an influence on how much they will help you or perhaps make your day bad if you fail. I feel like the humor in this game is a lot more subtle and less forced than in the first Original Sin game. It makes me feel to explore the world more and talk to NPCs. And the best thing: EVERYTHING IS FULLY VOICED! Which makes the game feel so finished.  Even that the artstyle is more cartoony, it is still beautiful in it's way. It doesn't look cheap or outdated, and there are many beautiful environments to adventure in. The music is good as well, I didn't feel bored by it. And you can change the main instrument of the battle songs of the characters you are playing, which is a nice detail. Other positive points on the game are: The Multiplayer mode, you can play an own campaign with your friends, or you can enjoy the main storyline too. This is a fun addition, and you can make it even more interesting with mods from the Workshop. The crafting system is unmissable from RPGs as well, and it is in this game as well. You can use almost everything you find to make armour, potions, arrows, grenades, whatsoever by combining them. This is fun to do, but I do recommend to find and use recipes since there are so many options.   So there is a lot of praise from me as well. But are there any downsides? Well, one thing that bothered me quite a bit was that there were plenty of bugs (some even gamebreaking) in the game. They have fixed many at the start of the release, but the further you get in the game, the more bugs and glitches you will find. That is a shame because this game is so wonderful, and has so much potential.  Do I recommend this game? Yes I definitely do! It has been a while since a game has been so enjoyable during the full playthrough and it feels like a worthy revival of the old partybased rpgs.  My rating for this game: 9/10."

1977,"Ben ""Hierophant Frog"" Rowan",266,2,0,"December 5, 2017",Recommended,212.1,I've played through the whole game a total of 2 times and am starting my 3rd playthrough. This is easily my favorite co-op game to play and one of my favorite games of all time. I 100% recomend this game to anyone who is interested in a rich story and incredible gameplay and music. Each playthrough is aroung 80 hours so you will certainly get your moneys worth.

1979,Wololo,51,2,1,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,683.6,"Prior to Original Sin (the first one) i was not into ""old-school"" RPGs at all and the turn based combat really did seem like it could get boring, but as soon as i began playing i totally fell in love with the series and the gameplay, the Turn-Based combat really allows for great strategic depth and especially in Original Sins 2 it does not feel to slow/boring at all. Also most of the improvements to core gameplay mechanics made since the Original really make the game look overall more polished and challenging. I can therefore really recommend this game to everyone who is into RPG-type games or tactical combat as these surely are its strengths, Be aware though that the higher difficultys (e.g. Tactician) especially require you to really use the game's systems such as crafting to get through resonably easy, that said the game certainly will make you die a few times anyway."

1984,Operator Rosell,46,2,0,"October 21, 2017",Recommended,35.1,"Bought the game 3 days ago. Playtime atm 17 hours. Need to be careful with this lads.  Pros -Amazing soundtrack. I have found myself stopped playing 2 times and just listening the soundtrack cause i think it might change if i enter other area. This has not happen to me since Final Fantasy 10. -NPCs are really well written and voice acted. I was amazed by Fane, The Red Prince and the Assasin dude in the beginning. Thats my 3 people party btw. -Turn based combat is really good. It is also challenging even on the lowest level on difficulty. -Game looks amazing with max graphic settings. The water makes me wanna jump in there and swim. -Quests and their completion is done really well. Not one quest feels like a chore and there is actually no direct markings on the map on where to go. It might show you a location of a NPC or location but the rest you have to figure out by yourself. Really nice oldschool vibe init. -I have only been out of the tutorial island and it took me 17 hours. I cant imgaine how much content there is for the rest of the game.  Cons: -Battle might be frustrating in the beginning if you are not familiar with the skills. It took me several attemps on several quests on the normal mode until my party was not demolished by the mobs. This is not really a bad thing cause we need more games that makes us learn the gameplay and try our best but i understand it might frustrate some poeple. -Camera. Camera is pain if you try to change the view all the time but you have to do it in order to loot everything. It takes some time to get used to.  Overall this game is really amazing. It gives me this deep athmospere like when i furst used to play Arcanum or Icewind dale. Totally recommended."
1985,Tally,119,2,0,"November 28, 2017",Recommended,42.0,"Pros:  Absolutely epic!  Fantastic story, nicely done turn-based combat, huge character build variety with endless skill combos, beautiful environments & soundtrack.  There are things to see and do in every corner of the world.   ---  Cons: Camera controls are severely lacking.  The game is so beautiful and I can't see most of it because of the awful camera controls.  Quest tracker leaves a lot to be desired.  I feel like when the fate of the world is hanging in the balance and there is much work to be done, your hero should be writing down a bit more detail in their journal.  ""My lizard friend wants me to find a lizard.""  That's it, no detail and pestering your lizard friend yields no additional information.  I'm just supposed to walk around and talk to EVERY npc until I find the right one.  There is a fair amount of back & forth that is starting to feel tedious.   For example: you stumble upon Z location, but in order to progress through the zone you need X item that is found in Y location.  Go to Y location.   In order to progress through Y location and obtain X item, you must travel to B location to do a quest and unlock a special ability. Go to B location to do said quest and obtain the special ability. Return to Y location, obtain X item, return to Z location. Basically every main story quest is like this, maybe it's because it's my first play through and I'm still learning, but it's getting a little repetitive.  At 25 hours in my save game seems to be getting a bit bloated.  I had this game on my mechanical hard drive and it takes a solid 5 minutes to load Reaper's Coast.  It's a bit less on an SSD but still pretty bad.  ---  Despite all of that, I still think that this game is absolutely worth every penny.  I can see myself playing this game for a long time."
1986,KreamKorn,288,2,0,January 8,Recommended,87.8,"One of the best games i've played in recent memory.  Great combat, music, and style, your choices matter and its all around amazing. Very much worth the buy."
1987,audaciousgenre,246,2,0,"October 23, 2017",Recommended,365.8,"One of the most flexible, polished, detailed, and generally enjoyable games I've ever played. If you like RPGs, you should play this game. Easy to pick up, gameplay can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.   Every character and NPC is voice-acted with individual dialogue, even down to the animals wandering around town - I've never encountered two NPCs who said the same thing. This may not sound huge, but it's a subtle effort that makes the entire experience far more immersive than I've seen in a game. For instance, talking to every random person in a town never feels boring or a chore. It's one of many seemingly minor decision by the creators that elevates the polish and feel of the game above other RPGs, and exemplifies the attention to detail put into every aspect of the game.   The mechanics are great, the graphics are great, controls are great, crafting is good (haven't played with it too much yet), music, writing and voice-acting are absolutely top-notch, skill/magic trees are flexible and mean you can essentially turn anyone in your party into whatever you want. Build archers who also summon and buff creatures to fight for you, two-handed-axe-wielding close-combat necromancers, seriously whatever you want.  I love this game - I'm not even halfway through it, but I already want to start another party just to try out new party builds.  Just get it, unless you're on a serious budget, and even then, it's probably worth skimping on groceries or something this month."
1988,Scumdog Millionaire,142,2,0,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,226.5,"This game is definatly my favourite RPG to come out this year. Everything's voice acted, you have tons of choices in dialogue and in combat. The music is great and it's visually a good looking game as well.  If you can manage to get a group of friends together to play this game it is definatly worth it."
1989,Krysle Quinsen,593,2,0,"November 13, 2017",Recommended,110.4,"This game can be co-op up to four players and there is PVP arena mode as well as GM mode. But I never tried it. So it will be an overall review in single player perspective.  The Story is awesome, it's about god and stuff, the writing is exceptional as well as voiceover, which is mostly a narrator style (think Bastion). Dialog choice is a 3rd person rather than a sentence. The plot twist is good, the lore is great and not out of places (most fantasy game that contains gods and magic mostly not explained well.) and are all connected with every character in the game. There's some noticeable rush in writing in the last act, though.  The puzzle is OK, not much pixel-hunting but last act is not that great and might confusing.  The Quest system is well-designed, there's not much hand-holding and marker much and you can literally kill everyone and not break the game. However, quest item can be sold or dropped, be careful about it.  There are 4 playable races in this game, Human, Lizard, Elf, Dwarf, all with their Skeleton version (8 in total) and can be customized, their lore is interested and not that cliche, the design is very exotic for Lizard. However, Elves do have some weird armor and facial but have interesting lore.  The Combat is just good in tactical stuff, this game used the Round-Robin style where you move one character for each turn, who have the highest initiative(speed). Because of this, a lot of thinking will be required whenever you want to burst someone down or set up some potential combo with environment effects using magic. (Oil/Poison + Fire = Burning Ground, Water + Electricity = Electrical Water or perhaps turning Burning into Steam then electrified it? or blessed fire for healing instead?) There's friendly-fire on magic, so be careful not to kill your melee characters. This game used Armor system (think Barrier from shooting game like Mass Effect) where most negative effect only worked when particular armor is depleted. Which IMHO, work better than RNG system in the first game. AI is also meanie, so don't go in blindly or grouped up too much. They're quite smart. There's quite balance issue in the late game, though, where you literally OP, especially with the usage of Source Abilities.  Although The Music isn't composed by Kirill Pokrovsky (RIP) but Borislav Slavov (Crysis Series) is doing a great job also! the theme is very memorizable, The Rivellon Theme is just too good, the combat music is nice (which also based on instrumental selected on character creation), The Battle for Divinity is story climax combat. There's one vocal song too.  Crafting, however, not that useful and a couple of recipes are useful. You might pick up a lot of junk thinking it as crafting mats, only to be used with one common scroll recipe.  This game support Modding, means there will be QoL mod, overhaul or a campaign for you to play. This disables achievement but there's a mod for it.  TL/DR: Looking for a good single/co-op cRPG with exceptional story and lore that is well-connected with awesome races (Lizard <3), a tactical turn-based combat that required a lot of strategies, perhaps just a game OST for your collection, or doing some RP with Game Master mode? then go ahead, full price!  Now, that's the potential GOTY award for 2017. My The ‚ÄúSuspension of Disbelief‚Äù Award.  PS: I don't write a review much, so it might be messy, I'll try to improve or perhaps changes the style."
