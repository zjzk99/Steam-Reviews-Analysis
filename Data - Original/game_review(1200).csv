0,"Let's see: -Game releases in Early Access with a lot of promise -As it does Larian constantly outdo them selves with updates -They vastly increase the complexity of the AI -Improve the progression in several ways -Give us two well developed and deep extra skill trees -Create a truly grand undead race with interesting mechanics -AGAINST ALL ODD include full voice acting for a game with the amount of dialogue -And include a fully orchestral soundtrack And the reviews for this masterpiece of a game are going down because some Russians got salty over the translations being delayed a bit. This game lost it's Overwhelmingly Positive rating simply because they didn't manage to translate all of the 80,000 or so lines of dialogue in time for the release. Seriously. EDIT: To everyone asking, the game is FULLY voice acted, every NPC, no matter how insignificant has a voice. That is somewhere in the area of 80,000 voices lines, where a lot had to be recorded 8 times for each one of the player voices.","September 14, 2017","2,002 people found this review helpful

2,"This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense! Great work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!","October 25, 2017","689 people found this review helpful

3,"♦ One of the best cRPG out there, if you are a fan of roleplaying games, this is definitely a must buy. For those who never play thier first game, no worries, although they take places in a same universe, each has a standalone story. This one starts thousand years after the first one so you are not missing anything. ♦ One of best thing about DOS 2 is it gameplay. It's turn-based, slow-paced but really interactive with many different elemental combinations, cool interactions between each abilities and your surrounding environmental even statuses are interesting. For some examples you can create some nasty chain explosive reactions with a combo of Fire and Poison, any kind of liquid (water/blood/poison/...) left on the battleground can reacted to Air turning it into a pool of Electricity deal damage and stun anyone in it. Lone Wolf or One Man Army does what it says for who want to go solo, Leech turn you into a vampire allowing you to heal when standing near blood or Zombie make Poison heal you instead but normal healing will damage you. Because the game is classless , you can be anyone , mix and match anything you like, you may be born a warrior but dream to be a mage, go learn some magic and become a battlemage. Who says warrior can't be sneaky, go ahead and get yourself some rogue abilities... it has a great balance between combat and talking with rich dialogues and occasional silly humors. You can play as different races: Human , Elf , Dwarf , Undead and Lizard..yeah thats' right, you can become a Lizard that spits out Fire. Each races have different racial skill and special power, NPCs may also react/talk differently to you depend on your race. There are also different original characters ingame who have thier own story, goals and personalites for you to play, but if you want to create your own character, the game also offer many different origins which called tags: Soldier, Scholar, Outlaw,..etc which plays a part in dialogue. The Origins will remain in your game as companion and you can have different perspective on them through dialogues/questline which is really cool imo, there is also a relationship system ingame (not fully included in EA , will be in full game) which can create intense rivalry, friendship, enmity and romance! Having finished Act 1 in EA, there are no fetch quests and unrelated to the storyline, all of them is connected one way or another, each tell you a story about the game's world and ultimately leading to a bigger picture. You can finish quests in different ways , any path is a progression, you'll never feel getting stuck, there are always different paths to take, things to do. Oh a maze, i'm not in the mood to solve puzzle atm, let's jump/fly through it, dont have wings? Look around, there's maybe some other hidden paths/shortcut or go do some questline maybe some of them will shed some lights of the Maze making it easier to go through. Just look up the crafting list in DOS 1, and before there were just a combination of two items, in DOS 2 you can have a combination of total 5 items. Here comes the great part, you can craft new skills by combining books of different schools. You can turn a normal rain into a mean blood storm. Mixing a Pryo spell with Necromancy, you can make corpses explode dealing massive damage to nearby targets as if you cutting thier buddies down wasn't enough.. which have up to 5 players in total which include 4 main players and 1 GM. Allowing you to create your own worlds and adventure with friends, the devs also offer alot of tools for easier time making your own dungeon, you can control anything, the stats, the weather, music, dialouges, events,..etc and you can even do it on the fly! You can take a quick look of the mode (a GM Mode game hosted by Matt Mercer)","August 15, 2017","518 people found this review helpful

4,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW You will love this game if... - You like games that don't hold your hand - You like games that allow you freedom to customise your characters and experiences - You like games that TRULY reward exploration and investigation *Legit, if you don't sit there scrolling over the map looking for hidden chests, ladders, ledges, etc, you're doing it wrong* - You like high strategy, turn based combat that rewards forward thinking and planning - You like finding, using, selling or collecting loot - You have 1 or more friends that will play with you. This game shines in multiplayer The handful of little annoying bugs and glitches are completely and utterly outweighed by how captivating and enthralling this game is... And it's still in Early Access... I see a lot of complaints that the story isn't long enough, or really focusing on the bugs, lets get real. Bugs: - Sometimes your helmet will blink and flicker a bit - Sometimes your characters won't be within range, or have line of sight on a target they clearly should - Accuracy percentage seems to be a bit off, 80% chance to hit is more like 30%; anything under 90% is trouble That's... About it... Story is too short? Well then play the rest of the game kid. You can speed run the ""story"" in like 20 minutes if you wanted, the real fun comes from exploring the world and finding everything else there is to do. I honestly can't believe how good this game is for an EA release and I can't wait for the full release come September. Could not recommend highly enough. Things I would like to see in future: - More races. - More in depth customisation options for spells and abilities. Think Champions Online or the Oblivion Spell-Creation. (asking for a lot, I know) - A little control over what armour looks like on your character. - More spells, more synergy between spells. This is already great, but why stop at great! The more points I list, the more I realise I'm just asking for more of the game. Give me more of the game mate.","June 5, 2017","489 people found this review helpful

5,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is like playing a very enthusiastic Dungeon Master's homebrew campaign. Said DM really fell in love with the cosmology and deities section of the Dungeon Master's Guide as well as the idea of creating an epic, REALLY LONG arc where his players eventually achieve godhood. Mr. DM also put an awful lot of time into fleshing out his world and making sure you know that HIS elves are DIFFERENT (they EAT people and get their MEMORIES, see), though for some reason he decided to keep his dwarves Scottish. This DM is not perfect and has his faults. For one, he really loves throwing environmental effects all over the battlefield to the point of it becoming annoying. Fire spreads 50 feet in an arc! Now ice shoots out over the fire! Now smoke and lighting and tentacles spread atop the fire and ice! Yeah! Near the end of the campaign, his planning starts to slip, both in combat design and in lore. For instance, he offers his players a variety of different endings to their grand adventure, but none of them are all that great, and one gets the feeling that he randomly chose the final boss by just flipping through the Monster Manual with the intent of picking a Challenge Rating 30 beastie just to tell his other DM friends that ""I PUT MY PLAYERS UP AGAINST THIS GUY ONCE AND THEY KIND OF SURVIVED!"" After playing for nearly 140 hours, though, none of his players can say it wasn't an epic time at the table. They'll probably be back for more. BTW, Mr. DM - Lohse was the best character you created.",March 2,"144 people found this review helpful

7,"This game is a masterpiece. Easily one of the best games I ever played in my life. The gear is very rewarding, you notice your characters actually develop and become way stronger with each level and each new gear equipment. The story is rich and the voice acting makes it really helpful if you don't like reading dialogues. You can play the game multiple times and you would have a different experience each time you play it. Try to get some friends to play with you, they can either help you or turn against you. For example your friend could tell the guards that you stole something and they will put you in jail!. or you can make your friend distract traders and you pickpocket them. I really recommend this game.","November 4, 2017","242 people found this review helpful

8,"I was tired of games that only tests your reaction skill. I was tired of games that say it's 60 dollars, only to have randomized loot boxes or micro-transaction implemented later in time. I was tired of games that were advertised to be wide as an ocean but ended up being shallow like a puddle. Then Divinity Original Sin 2 came out. Each encounter is well executed and designed flawlessly. Enemy design is varied and leaves my friend and I saying ""WTF is that!?"" often. Every time my friend finds some epic loot, we cannot wait to identify it to see who can make use of the item. Quests are a joy to do and often leads you to find more quests that's filled with important decision making. Every choice you make has an impact on the world and I have been sent to jail multiple times for making the wrong decision. For $44.99 you are not buying a game but an experience. An experience to truly go on an epic adventure. Fights are never easy but once you learn the satisfaction of besting the enemy combatant that you failed to take down multiple times, you are left leaving for more glory. (Currently playing on Tactician Mode) I am not sure if anyone is going to read this review since this is my very first review with a positive rating (My other review is for Fallout 4 CREATION CLUB so you already know what rating I gave) but if you are looking for a game with challenge, depth, and quality give this game a try. I have been playing this game for over 102 hours and I have a feeling that this is only the beginning.","September 23, 2017","518 people found this review helpful

Made by Larian Studios, it was able to level with AAA games that it even surpasses the standards, regardless of its flaws. You'll play as your own character in the story, and embark on a journey towards the world of Rivellon as you find the answer to the cause of the Void's awakening. You could also play as one of the six main characters with their own unique story if character creation is not your thing. Also, quicksaving before doing anything else is a must. Talk to someone, quicksave first. Interacting an item, quicksave first. Opening a door, quicksave. After an autosave, quicksave. The game is very similar to its previous title, (DOS1). There may be changes, but there's nothing too drastic as far as I've observed. (👍 = Good, 👌 = ok, 👎 = Bad) (Maximum of 1.0 per issue) ❌ Visual Bugs ( - 0.20 ) ❌ Gameplay Bugs ( - 0.05 ) NOTE: Can be fixed by reloading a save is obviously not for everyone to love. It's neither an Action RPG like Diablo that the majority wanted nor a hardcore RPG like Baldur's Gate. It's definitely not for those who hates reading a lot of texts as well. I would recommend this to anyone who, for once, has played and liked turn-based games because this one's the best of the genre as I'm writing this review.",February 16,"178 people found this review helpful

11,"After hitting over 400 hours in Divinity: Original Sin 2, I feel like I can finally review it in full depth. The game is spectacular. It was everything I wanted from Original Sin and then more. The quests are in-depth, and you feel the consequences of your character/race choices on top of the dialogue you pick. I've played four full playthroughs, and each one I was still finding things I had missed (and I'm sure I will find more in my next one). The story is just fantastic, I couldn't ask for more from a storyline. The game makes you want to read every little lore book and just learn more and more about anything and everything going on. And if you're an Original Sin fan, there's little pieces of lore left around everywhere for you to prick your ears up at and get excited about (and then some!). Then there's the combat. It's fantastic. It's incredibly strategic in every aspect. Your first playthrough on Tactician will give you some good laughs at some of the difficulty you need to face and work around (this is a good thing! My boyfriend and I faced some extremely hilarious moments of trying to figure out a fight and failing miserably when we were learning the game, it was amazing fun). And then you enter the realm of searching out perfect gear, perfect min-maxing, perfect stats, and perfect combat. That, in itself, is the most enjoyable aspect of the combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2. You can hop from easier combat to the most intense combat the game offers, and it's all fun. I recently finished my solo Honour Mode, and it was definitely hard and an adventure and left me sitting during quite a few fights thinking out beforehand how I was going to handle them because even the smallest mistake can mess you up. I can go on and on about how amazing the combat is, but you really just need to delve into it yourself to truly see how remarkable it is. I can't find anything I enjoy as much as D:OS2's combat system anywhere else. If you're looking for a game to literally lose yourself in for long periods of time, or to even play casually in your free time, this is definitely my go-to. This is just a masterpiece of a game, it's every fantasy and rpg player's dream come true. And did I mention the co-op is incredibly fun? Really, it's just a stunning piece of art. Now, I have a great many pros for D:OS2, but I do have a few cons, and these are entirely subjective, and my own personal opinion. I really don't enjoy the four-man party system. For someone like me, it's way too overwhelming managing four characters at all times, and I just don't like it. Because some best in slot gear pieces are unique and you won't find ANYTHING else with their bonuses on in the game (Second Skin, ihu), you're just sacrificing too much playing a full four-man. But that's from a min-maxing perspective, and probably not that important to others. The second part of why I don't like the four-man parties is because once you get a taste of the solid power of a Lone Wolf character, you really can't ever go back. Now this can be a good or bad thing. It gives the game a lot of replayable value, I'm about to hit my 5th playthrough and I'm finally needing to stray away from my babe Sebille ( ): ), which pushes me to pick other players to experience their stories. With all that being said, this is definitely a game I recommend anyone to buy. It's amazing in every aspect. I absolutely cannot wait until the Definitive Edition either. And big, big props to Larian Studios for their choice to give the buyers of D:OS2 the Definitive Edition for free. Incredible company who listens to their audience. I can't wait to see what future games come!",June 25,"104 people found this review helpful

12,"I cannot recommend this game enough. It is an RPG that breaks the boundaries of what you perceive an RPG to be. Every problem or puzzle has what feels like more solutions than you can conceive of. Original Sin 2 rewards clever thinking, tactics, and the role-playing itself over all else. Stat building and creating the ""perfect character"" is always a fun aspect of CRPGs but I'd say it's not the main focus here. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of numbers and plenty to min-max, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much damage you do if you're not in combat, and the game truly shines when you can avoid it. Don't get me wrong, the combat in this game is fantastic. You can control all of your (up to 4) party members individually outside of combat and prepare the upcoming battlefield to your liking assuming you have the drop on your opponents. Place your archers up top, give your wizards ample space, have clean terrain for your warriors, e.t.c. However, when you find yourself able to circumvent combat, you'll be rewarded with a level of satisfaction very rare in games these days. It constantly feels like Original Sin 2 almost dares you to break the game's boundaries. It challenges you to out-think the developers. Everything matters in this game. I'll leave you with an anecdote: As I explored, searching for a quest target, I came upon a ruin. I saw a passage through, but in between it and myself were a few foes I was most certainly not equipped to handle at my current level. In other games I'd probably have left and came back later when I was a higher level, but not here. I navigated around the edges of the NPCs' detection radius in stealth with each of my characters individually until I found a minuscule spot I could teleport to that would get me past my foes. It was certainly inconvenient, but it worked - I painstakingly teleported each of my characters in turn to that one spot only to realize the one doing the teleporting was stuck below; the one casting the spell is unable to use it on themselves. After some hard thought I realized I could place the teleportation artifact close enough for my previously transported characters to grab. I then used it to pull my last hero past the baddies. I exhaled a sigh of relief and then panned the camera to see I had just come face-to-face with the very character I had been trying to track down. I was positively oozing with smugness.",June 3,"139 people found this review helpful

The freedom is (even) better, the atmosphere, the character-building, the amazing replayability, everything. It's significantly better than the first, which I found enjoyable but didn't fall in love with. It had so much potential, but never really seemed to get there. This gets there - right away.

16,"Never played the first one, I hate turn-based combat and I bought this because I figured if I am going to ever like a game like this it will be this one. I installed the game and played almost 8 hours with only a couple breaks in between. I always found turn based games to be boring and somehow this one kept my attention. The way spells and combat with your party work together is just amazing. It really opened my eyes and maybe once I am done with this one I will go back and play the first. Might do that now that there is a sale! The story is well done so far and writing is top notch. Graphics are nice and the world seems so alive. So many side quests I am still in the first area. Performance is great, I am getting solid FPS (between 80-120) all settings maxed out in 1440. The soundtrack is great as well. Being fully voiced probably saved me for this game, I love reading but I hate reading in games, not sure I would have loved this as much as I do if it hadnt been voiced. Voice acting is actually really good in this game. Really looking forward to sinking tons of time into this game. ZERO regrets.","September 14, 2017","216 people found this review helpful

18,"Simply put, Divinity: Original Sin 2 expands on the best ideas from the first game while taking a complete 180 in tone to deliver a much darker and adult experience compared to the first. One of the most notable changes is immediately realized as character creation begins, with races, tags, origin stories, and a complete stat revamp giving a new level of depth to character creation. The origin story presets, while not customizable, deliver a unique experience for each. All of the notable ""origin story"" characters have interactions with each other, and even if you choose not to create them yourself, they can be found and interacted with around the world. Not only this, but you can recruit these important figures of the lore. Origin stories on the surface level seem gimmicky, but allow for a whole new level of replayability, in combination with the tag system. The tag system allows you to acquire new tags that effect quests and dialogue as you progress through the game, or assign them to your custom character in character creation. ""Origin story"" characters will have these tags preset, as well as a brief synopsis of their lore. However, the changes aren't just to the character creation. As soon as you get into combat, you'll quickly notice how much has changed. While Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps the basics of the first game intact, action points have recieved a complete overhaul, streamlining the process of choosing actions. While the new system (6 action points total; 4 action points at the start of encounter. Most skills cost 1-2 action points) may seem to cater to a more casual audience at first, the new skills that accompany this revamp allow for a level of complexity in combat never before seen in the Divinity series. New skills introduced in the second game are more ambitious, creative, and innovative than any in the first game. Even from the start of the game, you'll acquire interesting abilities that you can use to control the battlefield. The new targeting system provided in D:OS2 gives a sense of clarity lacking in the first game. Height advantages and disadvantages means that positioning matters now more than ever before. In addition to the ""surfaces"" system of the first game (fire, poison, poison clouds, static clouds, electrified water, etc), most of these surfaces can now be blessed and cursed for interesting variations and choice in combat. For example, while fire is harmful to your team, if you bless it, it'll apply a heal every turn and prevent the members within from being frozen. The campaign here is of absolutely astounding quality and length - my first full playthrough of the game took roughly 80 hours, even without dozens of sidequests. No matter your choice of origin character or custom, you'll find the campaign to be deeply satisfying. However, as noted by the developers, you are meant to play with the origin story characters - and it shows. Each origin character has at least half a dozen unique encounters. While the game is still engaging if you're playing as a custom character, the origin stories really do allow for a better capacity for role playing and it's interaction in the game world. For the Steam Awards of 2016, this is my pick for the Most Astounding Game. The staggering amount of interactions in the game, even in alpha, can be overwhelming. Divinity: Original Sin 2 could very well shape up to be Game of the Year 2017 for me.","September 15, 2016","253 people found this review helpful

19,"I'm 72 years old and these have been the best 20 hours of my life. EDIT:: After playing through the game multiple times, including finishing it on Honour Mode, I have to say that my opinion of this game is even higher than it was after those first 20 hours. After finishing this game, it feels like my life is complete and there's nothing left to live for. This may be the last game I ever play and review I ever write. I would like to thank Larian for filling a void that has been plaguing me for more than half a century. I found the main story as well as every single side quest/story to be fun and interesting. There are no boring fetch quests as far as I can tell. How you handle side quests and whether you complete them or not 'does' affect the ending; as such, they could be considered extensions of the main story. (You could be unsatisfied with the ending if you just rush through and skip things.) You can build your characters any way you see fit and almost any build is completely viable. If you don't like the way you built your characters, just wait until you complete Act 1 and you can rebuild them any way you want as frequently as you want all the way up to the very end of the game; this is very good for testing new things out. By the end of the game my main character was a fire breathing Geo/Pyro battle mage that wielded a fire staff, used Warfare skills and showered my enemies in meteors with some necromancy for physical damage in case the enemy had too much resistance to those elements; she was pretty godly. I plan on trying a solo Honour mode run next with a similar but more diverse build. (I love the lizards!) For me, the best part of this game is the combat. It's extremely well done and very fun. I can't really say any more than what the other reviews cover though. Just know that if a fight seems absolutely impossible, that it really isn't. I've gone into fights where half my party was annihilated before I got to do anything, yet I still emerged victorious. There's always a way to win even if the enemy has you outnumbered and outleveled; just gotta think! Like many reviews state, there are still some bugs. As far as I can tell, they are all minor. After multiple play throughs on multiple difficulties I have not experienced any major bugs. Nothing game breaking and nothing that really affected my gameplay much. The few bugs I've experienced: - Many unvoiced lines in Arx. - Incorrect journal entries. - Sometimes a character would act blind in combat even though they weren't (could't use any ranged skills, couldn't see around themselves, but this was rare and only lasted a single turn.) - Sometimes the enemy AI would derp out and they'd just run around or repeatedly climb up and down a ladder until they were out of AP. - Custom undead characters do not receive the appropriate immunities, such as bleeding and suffocation. (though I don't recall any of my characters ever being afflicted with Bleed...) (Fane does receive these immunities) - Undead afflicted with Decay will not attempt to avoid poison puddles (Not sure if this is a bug or an oversight). - Altitude does not affect many player or enemy melee attacks. (Entities 10+ meters above can be struck with melee.) But it does affect some skills, such as Dragon's Blaze, Laser Ray, charging skills, Battle Stomp, etc. ... I think that's about it. I'll add more if I remember them. Some reviews complain about enemies being omniscient and knowing all of your strengths and weaknesses (including whether you're undead or not), which is true, but it's also true for players. Any player with Loremaster on one of their characters can examine any NPC or enemy to gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Only one of your characters needs Loremaster. If you examine with someone that doesn't have it, they use the skill level of whoever does, even if that person is dead. (This even works on the final boss, at no point in the game is it unfair that enemies can spot your weaknesses.) So in summary, very fun game, great character customization, great combat, good story, a few minor bugs. It can be challenging in some scenarios but it's supposed to be; that's at least half the fun. I could mention the poor inventory management but countless reviews already cover that. Tip: Carry a couple pieces of +Thievery and +Loremaster gear with you to make sure you can pick any lock and identify any item. There may be times when your base skill isn't sufficient. TL;DR: Recommended, as shown above. 10/10 on the Completely Subjective, Arbitrary and Useless rating system.","September 19, 2017","2,141 people found this review helpful

20,"This is without a doubt one of the best RPGs I have ever played and after completing it I can honestly say it has secured its place among my top favorite games of all time. When beginning the game you have the option of creating your own character or choosing from one of several premade characters, each with their own unique backstories and questlines. I highly recommend going this route as these characters and their quests are very well written and interesting. I found myself extremely invested in my main character (Lohse) and what would become of her and her companions. It's also really interesting witnessing the members of your party, each with their own motivations and biases, try to work together while also clashing as they look out for their own best interests. Each character is so well written and perfectly voice acted that it really helped make what is already such an immersive game feel even more alive. The dialogue is great, whether it be the main characters or random NPCs, it really feels like everyone has their own unique personality. The gameplay is incredibly fun, and I really can't think of the last time I had such a hard time putting down a game. You are given a lot of freedom, leaving it entirely up to you how you choose to progress throughout the world. There are often numerous ways to complete one task, depending on just how creative or good/evil you want to be. To add to this, the choices you make actually have consequences, and sometimes the line between what is right and what is wrong might not be so clear. So you will sometimes find that a decision you made might come back to haunt you in one way or another. I loved this and it was really cool seeing how some of the choices I made previously came to have a much wider impact than I had originally imagined. The turn-based combat system is really well done and there are lots of ways in which you can get creative and use the environment to your advantage. Each battle is well designed and interesting, with each type of enemy presenting their own unique strengths and weaknesses. You have to really put some thought into exactly how you design your group, providing for a nice amount of strategy both in and out of battle. If you find that you have messed up your build there is an option to respec, something which I think most of us can appreciate for its ability to save us a lot of wasted time. It is also worth mentioning that there are quite a few options as far as difficulty. I did my first playthrough on Classic, which is the default difficulty, and found it to be perfect for me. There were a few fights which I struggled on, but anytime I faced such a roadblock I found that all I needed to achieve victory was to simply reevaluate my strategy. Personally I love just how rewarding of a feeling this can be, and I look forward to doing future playthrough on the harder difficulties. However if you're someone who is looking for less of a hassle, you will be happy to find that the lower difficulty, Explorer, will allow you to simply enjoy the ride without any frustration. The quests are extremely fun and varied, some of which require solving puzzles, riddles, or getting a bit more creative with your abilities and items. One thing I really loved about the quest system is that it doesn't hold your hand, meaning that unlike some RPGs that basically give you a GPS tracker showing you exactly where you need to go, this game tends to just point you in a general direction and expect you to figure it out on your own. Now if this is offputting to you, please know I am speaking as someone with a truly awful sense of direction. I had a ton of fun with this and found that getting lost while trying to find where I needed to go to next provided for some of my favorite moments. Some of the random encounters you come across as you explore are the most surprising and rewarding experiences in the game. The attention to detail is truly incredible and the world really feels so alive. Even areas that at first glance appear to be devoid of life might have something hidden. Especially with the pet pal ability, which allows you to talk to animals, or spirit vision which allows you to see/speak to ghosts, you'll find that if you look close enough there is no shortage of things to be seen or done. And to top this all off the soundtrack is incredible, providing the perfect music to accompany you on what is truly an epic journey. The universe that Larian have built here is absolutely astounding and they managed to pack so much into this game that it's honestly a bit overwhelming at times. Between all of the characters and their questlines, the decisions you have to make throughout the game, and the sheer size of the world, it's truly impossible to take it all in on just one run. Speaking as someone who rarely plays games a second time, I'm already gearing up for my second trip into Divinity Original Sin 2 and imagine I'll be making even more eventually. Now that I've ranted and raved about just how much I adore this game I must point out really the only negative thing I have to say about it, and that is just how buggy it can be. During the course of my 111 hour playthrough I ran into a number of bugs, ranging from mildly annoying to gamebreaking. The biggest one, of course, being the gamebreaking bug which made it impossible for me to enter into a room you need to use to begin the final quest. In order to get around this I had to get a bit creative and basically stack items until I could get one of my characters to glitch into said room, then allowing the rest of my party to teleport to me. While I am obviously pleased that I was able to get past this annoying bug, I can't help but be frustrated that such a problem would even exist in the first place. For as much as I love this game some of the bugs I faced really took away from my overall enjoyment and I truly hope Larian will patch them as soon as possible. Of course I'm sure there are those who played the game without facing bugs, but it doesn't change the fact that I was unfortunate enough to encounter them and that some of you might as well. Overall I truly love this game and believe it deserves all of the praise it is getting. As I mentioned, my one and only complaint are some of the bugs I encountered. While frustrating, such issues can easily be fixed through a patch. And it does speak to just how captivating I found this game to be that I continued to press on despite these issues. There is absolutely no denying that this was a game crafted with a lot of love, and so I have complete faith that Larian will continue to be very active in it post release. If you're on the fence than I suggest you wait a bit to buy, but I imagine it won't take long for these issues to be fixed. For 45 Euro I managed to get one of the most amazing gaming experiences I have ever had and I encourage everyone who is interested to give it a try. This game is a masterpiece, plain and simple.","October 21, 2017","152 people found this review helpful

21,"Hands down one of the best CRPGs in recent history. I'm willing to say I liked this even more than Pillars of Eternity, and I'm a Infinity Engine RPG nut. It's a bit different than your classic CRPG, the main story doesn't seem that extraordinary, but it grows on you. It's not what makes the game good. The journey is. - You have multiple ways to achieve things. Want to steal a chest without being seen? Teleport it away from affar. Want to blow up a door but it has too much HP? Blow it up with an explosive barrel. Want to escape a keep of evil clerics? Well I'll let you figure that one out for yourself, you'll have many ways to chose from. - The voice acting is great considering how little budget they had compared to triple A companies. - Every NPC has something to say. - The writting is just right, and very immersive. - Remember the combat in Torment:Tides of Numenera? Wipe that nightmare out of your memory with the combat in this game. It's fun, complex and actually makes you look forward to battles. - Each companion is unique and complex. Great char development as well as you proggress. I could go on for ages. The bottom line is they have outdone themselves immensly with this game. Go buy it and support Larian so they can make more.","September 23, 2017","129 people found this review helpful

22,"As a former Black Isle designer I'm rather critical when it comes to games. I have very high expectations and I'm rarely satisfied with games today. It would be more appropriate to say that I've been 'content' with the games I play now and leave it at that. Well, that is not the case with Divinity: Original Sin 2. I'm quite envious of the fact that I was not involved with the design of this game. It has exceeded my expectations and provided me with many hours of gaming pleasure. I can only hope and pray that future sequels, please let there be more to come, are of equal or greater quality. Thank you Larian for the many hours of gaming pleasure I have received from this game. Please keep up the good work. My sincere compliments to you and your staff.",February 13,"224 people found this review helpful

23,"After playing this game for a few weeks, I can say that DOS2 has replaced Skyrim as my all time favorite RPG. It's that good. Pros: Voice acting, graphics, ""turn based"" combat, immersion factors all get a solid 10. I haven't finished the game, but so far the story is interesting, and even if the story ending stinks, it still has that draw you in factor. As for re-playability, it's already apparent to me that I'll have to play it again with the other available characters so I can experience their stories. There is the main story line, and each of the 5 pre-created characters have their own stories. I chose to create my own character, which means I have 3 of the 5 available pre-created characters as my compatriots, each with their own stories to be completed. With my current playthough, I'm not going to know how Sebille or Lohse's stories finish out. They're not in my party so, I gotta play again with them to find out how their stories end. An EXTREMELY well crafted RPG. This one is a clear and unmistakable winner. Kudos to Larian for self-publishing to avoid the pressure to release the game before they completed what they intended the game to be. You guys got it correct. Although I'm not a fan of third person, overlooking the party, view point games (I prefer first person... eyeballs forward), this one succeeds in grasping my attention and refusing to let it go. I'm drawn in, focused, worried, and sssso happy when a fight is over and all the characters under my control are still alive, I'm almost bouncing up and down in my seat ready for the loot. It's a blast to play! The only downside I've felt so far - and it's not really terrible - is inventory management. There's a load of stats, and as with any RPG, we all want all the stats to be as high as possible. Well, it ain't gonna happen. There's the agonizing struggle around applying the puny number of level up points to a plethora of possibilities. And, the loot that's uncovered has a variety of statistical applications that can be distributed to... well... do I want this? Who best to give it to? Arrrrgh! I like those extra points with that, but this one has these two stats.... which one to choose? Maybe I could give it to this character... but then I lose those stats. Grrrrr! Maybe I should keep it for later on? No. Maybe I'll just sell it. No... should I wait? Maybe it'll be useful in this situation? What... ever.... should.... I... do??? **blank it*** I'll just sell it. No, I'll keep it for later. ARRRGH!!! It's involved, at times frustrating, and can be overly time consuming. There's so many items that can enhance a variety of disparet statistics, it can be overwhelming. It's like a 20 page menu of delicious food at a great restaraunt to a starving man. I WANT IT ALL!!! I've always been of the opinion that less is more. This game does not embrace that. There's a lot of items, that do a lot of different things, and I've probably spent more time trying to figure out who should get what, for the maximum impact, than I've spent exploring. I'm not really unhappy about that though. For me, it's at most a minor annoyance. There is a crafting mechanism that I could take a deep dive into, which some people will do because they like exploring that type of mystery. Me? I try not to be an item hoarding ♥♥♥♥♥, but ultimately I lose out on certain discoveries. But hey, it's all good y'know? I may miss out on a side quest here or there, but there's too much other content to discover so even though I've ""broken"" a few side quests so far, I've forgotten about them so I just press onward with the quests that are currently before me. Let me put it this way: Inventory management can be tedious, but if you ""explore"" it, certain items can open additional quests. Sheesh! As if there wasn't enough to do already! Oh, and if you put a point into Pet Pal, you can talk to the animals. Which open up probably a few dozen side quests to have fun with. I mean, why wouldn't you? There's only a hundred quests along the way, so why not open up a few dozen more??? A.. go on! You got the time! This game is easily worth the current price of around $40. My favorite gaming experiences have been with RPG's, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now my favorite of all time. Well done Larian!",August 4,"248 people found this review helpful

24,"Play it...just play it. This is easily one of the greatest rpgs ever made, and I would recomend it to litteraly everyone. If you like a great story, great turn based combat with an insane amount of depth, and beautiful visuals, you will fall in love with this game as much as I did. I've played through DOS1/DOS EE around 7 times, and while the story in that game was unintresting, the gameplay alone kept me coming back. DOS2, even in its alpha state, is a vast improvement over DOS1/DOS EE in everyway. Kill whoever you want, steal whatever isn't nailed down, Dos2 gives more freedom than any rpg to date. *Slight Spoilers*: You can kill the gaurds on the boat, and the game has dialouge to reflect that you did. You can also kill your companions on the boat or leave them to die, and there is special dialouge for both of these actions. Update: After having finished the full game I can safely say this is my favorite rpg of all time, period. Larian did an icredible job with this game, and its very obvious just how much love and care went into this game. Update as of Nov 24th 2017: I've now put in over 600 hours in and I still can't stop playing it. When I'm not playing it I'm think about, and if that's not an indication of this game's quality I don't know what is. This is my game of the century, and Larian Studios has given me hope for the game industry. This is a must buy, especially if you want to give the middle finger to scummy publishers who fill their games with microtransactions, loot boxes, and other anti consumer pratices. A few bugs here and there, but nothing that truly detracts from the over all experience, and the game is patched roughly once, and Larian is one of the few publishers that I trust to fix everything (even if things that are wrong are miniscule).","June 24, 2017","114 people found this review helpful

25,"An adventure! If I had to describe Divinity: Original Sin 2 in a word, that would be it. An adventure. Without a doubt, it’s the best modern cRPG game up to date. And as an oldschool gamer, I can understand when someone is saying that nothing can stand in one line with games like Planescape: Torment or Baldur’s Gate. Well, it couldn’t. Until now. Times changing, and so gaming industry is changing. And we have just received the best, most polished cRPG game ever made. It has to be said, even if we are sentimental. The world of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is full of content and what’s the best, we can interact with almost everything and everyone. There are no boring NPC’s with exactly the same dialogue lines. In this game everyone is unique and has something to say. Also, we are talking here about huge cRPG game that is fully voice acted (!) and it’s not Oblivion-like voice acting with 5 actors. The main narrator, who is with us most of the time, and all the other voice actors, did an outstanding job here. Every character sounds special. If you have played first Original Sin you know what to expect from fights. They can be approached in many different ways. Even in tough fights, one properly used scroll or skill can change everything. Of course in both ways, because we can easily lose. The fights are hard, made to think in strategic ways and what’s the most important, they are very satisfying. Comparing to other cRPG games it’s one of the best parts of Divinity. It took me roughly 105 hours to finish the game once, so it can be said that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the biggest cRPG games. What’s more, this game has high replayability value. Every character has its own personality and its own origin story. By playing with different characters we have new quests and we can approach many situations in totally different way – origin characters have their own interactions across whole game. The main story is interesting and I have never lost my interest. I don’t want to spoil anything, but it’s just really good piece of writing. Side quests are keeping high level as well. Same as in first Original Sin, we also receive minimal amount of help in all the quests. I have completed this game few days ago and to be honest, I can’t wait to play it again. I am thinking about new characters and about making different decisions in several points of the game. It’s something amazing. There are many huge games, like The Witcher 3 or Fallout 4 that can give you +/- 100 hours of actual playtime, but those are mostly single experience games. You are not playing them again. In Civilization series we are saying about “one more turn” syndrome. Here we have “one more hour”, “one more evening” and “one more day syndrome”! The game is quite fresh, so there are still bugs. I haven’t experienced any gamebreaking bug though, but there are many small things that for sure will be fixed in the future. What’s more, the final act and final battle are both the weakest parts of the game. You can feel that devs were in hurry here, but on the other side, whole game is so good, that It simply can’t. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is, in my humble opinion, the best game of year 2017. Let’s just hope we will see more cRPG’s like this in the future (Obsidian, we are looking at you). Whoop. We've got quite a long review here! Enjoy the game! :) EDIT: Found typo.","November 7, 2017","100 people found this review helpful

27,"Divinity Original Sin 2 - Larian's second foray into the grand re-imagining of the Divinity universe, and one can only say... they really outdid themselves this time. Larian Studios takes a bold step into the old RPG style that players were so enamoured by with the original Divine Divinity, only with all the polish of modern capabilities, and the extremely successful and informative release of Divinity Original Sin (and its Enhanced Edition) granting them insight into the necessary improvements that make DOS2 the absolute masterpiece that it is. Players can be sure to find themselves trapped within this game for such lengths of time that the outside world shall begin to pass by unnoticed, as one becomes so transfixed with the beauty of Larian's latest release. Divinity Original Sin 2 is perhaps the most engaging, exciting, satisfying and well-designed Adventure RPG of the decade... and that is quite the title to fight for. ----------------- The world of DOS2 is massive. Hours upon hours upon hours of dense, creative and unique content stacked together in this vibrant and stunning game world. Every location itself is chock full of fantastic characters, all fully voiced with quality acting, and each with a rich and realistic personality and story that drive the player's desire to uncover every ounce of their story and build upon the deep lore and sprawling history of the world of Divinity. The main campaign spans four Acts, each filled to the brim with hours of non-linear content including side quests, treasure hunts, battles, secrets to be uncovered and more all with multiples ways to be completed and numerous outcomes - and with such immense amounts of freedom and player choice, the likes of which almost no modern game can compete with, there really is no dull moment in Divinity, and this game is a shining example of the effort and dedication Larian puts into their work. ----------------- The combat of DOS2 has been revamped since the previous release, though maintaining much of what it once was. Divinity Original Sin 2, like its predecessor, adopts turn-based combat, and turns it into one of the most finely crafted and perfect editions of this style of combat to date. Every moment of battle is exciting and even for one such as I, whom rarely plays turn-based games, the combat was astoundingly well designed and thoroughly enjoyable. Players command all manner of skills thanks to the diverse customisation options available and freedom of choice, with crafting bombs, traps, potions, poisons, arrows and much, much more, players will always find themselves with an array of tools with which to combat the enemy. No class is tied to any particular tree of skills, and one can mix and match as they see fit... provided they learn how to best use such abilities. DOS2 encourages interactivity with the environment, and players have much freedom to use objects, terrain and combinations of attacks for devastating effects. If there is oil, set it ablaze. If there is water, freeze it so that your enemies slip. The combinations are many, and are far deeper and complex than just those above. This game holds some of the most complex and intriguing combat systems I know. Combat is by no means forgiving, and the game boasts a variety of difficulty options that make enemies easier, or expand their skills sets and AI intelligence such as that they pose worthy adversaries to even well skilled players. ----------------- Something brought to players for the first time in Divinity Original Sin makes its triumphant return in DOS2, and that is the wonderfully designed multiplayer aspect. Drop-in / drop-out co-op allows players to seamlessly enter the world of another player and join them on their journey... be they ally or foe. The multiplayer system is beyond extensive, and to the delight of some players, and the woe of others, players can act as friend or foe on their journey - and betrayal is a sweet thing. The absolute freedom of the multiplayer system does have its faults however, as playing with strangers can sometimes lead to them rushing through things, progressing without you or making choices that you didn't want to make. It is highly recommended that players save co-op until after their first playthrough, or only play with friends that one can communicate with easily and rely on. DOS2s world is too big and too grand to risk someone spoiling it for you. However, in my experience, playing DOS2 with a friend or two (or 3) is an inimitable experience that all should try. Working together or against one another towards the finale of this game is thrilling beyond imagination. ----------------- So, alongside the beautifully crafted world, intricate characters, massive freedom of choice, expansive customisation and awesome combat, Divinity Original Sin 2, much like other installments in the series, boasts an amazing soundtrack. Composed by Borislav Slavov, DOS2s soundtrack combines epic scores, emotional pieces and the jovial warmth of tavern music in one of the best compositions of the year and even beyond, rivalling that of Hollow Knight, NieR: Automata and potentially even the Witcher 3. With traditional styles of RPG music reminiscent of golden oldies, each with its own unique flair and spark, and returning tracks from other Divinity titles, the music of Larian's latest game is something no-one will not enjoy. Hours of beautiful tracks, some of which are placed so heart-wrenchingly well within the game world that you will no doubt be straight onto YouTube and listening to the whole lot for hours. With everything else DOS2 has to offer, the Soundtrack really is the cherry on top, and it is something to behold. ----------------- To summarise Divinity Original Sin 2 into one word, it would have to be... brave. Larian Studios started the development of this game precariously, via Kickstarter backing; and after the amazing success of Divinity Original Sin, they had certainly garnered enough interest to support their new installment. Their return to old school RPG styles was a risk that paid off... not because the style is popular, but because Larian took something good, and turned it into something beyond great. DOS2 is, and will no doubt remain for some time, among my favourite games of all time. I have sunk so many hours into this game, through several playthroughs and still each new one is unique and engaging. Here is a timeless game. Play it, with all my heart, I tell you to play it.",March 13,"75 people found this review helpful

Also, whatever you do, DO NOT go for spoilers of any kind. Just take some time off work and play this game... trust me. The only danger here is that after I finished the game, I kinda feel like I'm done with gaming. I feel... complete, like every game I ever played was building up to this and nothing could ever be better than Divinity 2 (particularly Lohse's story arc). So, keep that in mind.

30,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW First time reviewing a game, but felt I should on this one. I never did play the first game though heard good things about it, so figured give the second a run. So far...even in early access I can't say I was disappointed. The game it's self reminds me of classic computer RPGs and pen 'n paper RPGs I played when I was much younger just a bit more fair and easier to understand yet still maintaining a lot of what made them challenging. Character customization starts a bit limited but as you get higher in levels its more about what you want to play and what your party members be. You are not locked into your starting class at all and I love that, hoping they have a lot more choices in the full release. Gameplay wise is point and click, though I found there is a lot to interact with in the world in different ways, one of the more different ways I found was that playing an Elf or having an Elf in your group, the elf can eat a corpse and gain the memories of that person, and it actually does play a part in the game. Combat is much of the same, point and click with a lot of tactical choices to make, the enemy AI is well refined and act in actually very smart ways even on the easier difficulties. I also found it pretty neat how your spells, items and attacks can change the battle ground and make hazards for yourself and your enemies, with the enemies able to do the same. Such as freezing a wet spot on the ground to give a chance of someone slipping on the spot or shocking the water with lighting to stun everyone standing in the wet spot. Though at times at least for me I found it hard to move to avoide these hazards at times like the area they were affecting were slightly larger than they really were. I even tried a bit of co-op with friends and a bit hidden in a sense once we figured it out, connecting with one another was clean and easy to do. Storywise I found interesting enough, a dark world with many dark themes with demons, torture and corruption. The premade characters have backgrounds and behave well according to their backgrounds. Another different system in this game is the tag system. Basicly pick tags for your character and you will have in game choices that you can make based just on those tags you pick. The pre mades having different choices as well they can make based on their stand alone backgrounds. Though it does feel you can get same results no matter your background still, it does help with immersion and at in making your created character feel seprate from the rest. Graphics, are not that important to me, but they are decent enough in this game. Though playing completely zoomed out (pretty much the only way to play an RPG like this) I found it a bit difficult to notice things I could pick up or interact with since they are so small. A few rare times I misclicked on something because of how small it is. I have an older system, so I wasn't able to play on the highest settings, I was able to however able to play on high even though the game suggested I play on low. So I can see pretty much everyone able to play this game with no issues. Even when I tried the highest settings I just had a slight drop in Frame rate. Overall Divinity 2 I recommend highly, especially if you are a fan of old school RPGs and Pen 'n Paper RPGs, you will feel right at home playing this with a high level of immersion and ability to costumize your character however you desire. Story had been done before but it's presented well in the world, and should be interesting enough to keep you playing. Combat is deep, and will challenge the thinking sides of your brain to approach each encounter in most effective way possible, plus have you thinking best way to build your characters to deal with threats in your prefered way. You might find a little frustration in interacting with the world due to how small things are and will even miss a few things if you aren't careful, but it shouldn't be a big enough issue to remove any enjoyment in the game. Hope you found this helpful if you took the time to read it.","September 14, 2017","223 people found this review helpful

31,"Now that 2017 is but a memory I can say with confidence that Divinity: Original Sin 2 was my Game of the Year. Although I backed the game on Kickstarter (just like the first) and had an Early Access copy, I didn’t play it until full launch so that I could fully immerse myself. And immerse myself I did into this high-fantasy adventure that manages to make the magical and fantastical feel realistic and gritty. It has taken everything that was good about Divinity: Original Sin and improved upon it, whilst also making it so you don’t need to have played the first in any way as it takes place a thousand years before. Whether I’m following a quest that portrays me as the savior of the universe (hero complex much?) or trying to solve the angst of a tiny rat I really believe in my characters and their responses. There is a balance between the epic and the banal, the frivolous and the fateful that creates a woven world that is wonderful to experience. In my first playthrough, co-op with a friend, I’m a summoner, focusing on gathering my minions. I’m a bit heavy handed though, I’ll send my minions into battle at a moments notice from afar, but stand aside, watching the ebb and flow, supporting and commanding the field. I speak harsh truths and it frequently gets me into trouble even though I feel righteous. In my solo playthrough, I’m a morally ambiguous pickpocketing hitman with a deep, dark past that I’ve blocked from memory. I fight with my words, and flirt with absolutely everyone, often getting what I desire in alternative ways. Even though the majority of the quests are the same on multiple playthroughs (bar the character story quests which too, are dark and deep), it feels different. Different dialogue and varying methods result in genuinely diverse results and that’s testament to the freedom, flexibility and depth of the game. Divinity: Original Sin 2 rewards exploration and creativity as many side quests can only be discovered or completed by turning over every rock, talking to every NPC or trying things that are a little out of the box. This may frustrate some but delighted me at every stage. There are no glowing quest signs and immersion breaking yellow exclamation marks here. If you don’t like reading, that’s fine – as everything is beautifully and uniquely voiceovered. But if you don’t like paying attention to detail, you’re going to miss out on a lot of the fun. This game is for people who like to genuinely invest their time and attention into the world they’re playing and the characters in it. Perhaps that, above all else is what reminds me of the D&D campaigns from my youth that I sorely miss. Tactically the combat is as complicated as you make it, with different difficulty settings that cater to your preference for challenge. You can brute force things if you’re so inclined, but you’re rewarded for playing smart at any level and the game gives you the tools to feel like a tactical genius, with a deep satisfaction when you pull off a clever combo. Divinity: Original Sin 2 has the old school charm of Baldur’s Gate and Planescape Torment but with modern mechanics and beautiful aesthetics, I finally feel like an RPG has surpassed them. It only took a few decades for us to get here. I wonder if this is the pinnacle of the genre and how long it’ll be before I can say that about a game again. ♥♥♥ If you find the reviews of an old Welsh lady interesting, please follow .

33,"Well. I don't like tedious quests, I dont like common NPC stereotypes, I hate lousy combat mechanics and poor strategy, and above all else I hate it when a game plays like it literally cant spell ""scenario"". But raising a baby demon chicken to conquer the world and tele-rob ignorant merchants? Igniting grenades in people's pockets and befriend a cat for no effing reason ? Just cause you know, he's like mysterious and all? And he's a really good looking cat, all the while being lectured by a crab? Oh, and trying to become a demigod and save the world, apparently insane pathing possibilities (OH DEAR TP) Well rounded scenario, emo NPCs that drink blood or are possessed by demons like it's totally fine, and GOD the landscapes!!! I did spend a whole 10 minutes exploring a map and praising its beauty before remembering I had entered a fight. Hell, I just like clicking a spell and not actually launching it cause the casting animation is then suspended and they're F***ING MAGNIFICENT (not as much as my cat, tho. He's a nice cat.) So yeah, Maybe it's a bit too much, maybe it's been written a hundred times but playing this in coop mode was (one of?) the best gaming experience in my entire life. Entertaining, challenging, captivating, and of course it makes no sense sometimes cause you keep doing awesome tricks with your cat to try F**KING with the scenario. But you know what? It adapts to all the sh*t you do. It gets your sh*t together. It gets it all together, puts it in a backpack, all your sh*t, so it's all together. And then it makes wonders from out of nowhere and you're like ""but I was trying to act crazy! And I did! And still, cool sh*t keeps happening! It's a F***ING transsh*itation!!! Like alchemy or something!"" It's beautiful, smart sometimes even touching, funny as hell, and you know the best part? It has a cool cat. And it's nice. And hidden quests, and insane replayability, and nutsy combos, and a perfect leveling/reroll system, and Malady is kinda sexy but like, not entirely but that's okay. And talking boat, and a condor, a phoenix omelett and A CAT. AND GODS AND ALL BUT A CAT MOSTLY. And you know what? THE CAT REALLY IS IMPORTANT!!!! I mean even a common (though really nice) cat DOES HAVE its own scenario and voice acting!! Cause every EFFING DIALOG has voice acting!!! like hours of it! This is your best investment this year and if you have a friend that you like and he likes good ol RPGs like you (Baldur's gate, Neverwinter Night, Icewind Dale's fans, I'm looking right at yo, dawgs), buy it and offer it like my friend offered it to me. And play that crazy mindf***ing adventure together. You deserve it. Most importantly, the cat does.",April 3,"194 people found this review helpful

38,"At times, this game has instilled a sense of wonder in me, that I've very rarely felt in over 20 years of gaming. It's made me laugh out loud, and genuinely care. There's an overwhelming amount of things to see and do, and there's immense depth everywhere you look. This is the one game I don't regret buying at full price — and I'd gladly give Larian more as good and honest developer. I can tell that this title is a labour of love. I genuinely think we'll be looking back at DOS2 in a decade, as a classic in the cRPG genre.","September 19, 2017","86 people found this review helpful

39,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW When I first got this game, I was immediately assaulted by an array of limiting areas, tough enemies, and hard fights, to the point where it felt like I wasn't allowed to do anything except a very strict railroad of easier enemies in order to progress. It made me start to lose faith in the game, because it seemed like there was only an illusion of freedom. But then I got good. After floundering around in my first save file for a good few hours, I sat down and made a new character, applying everything I had learned. I made a focused character. I scrounged for every piece of armor, clawed at every possible avenue and advantage, and I applied the very tactics that destroyed me in the first playthough. It didn't take long to learn that if done right, the game is just as impossible for your enemies as it could be for you. What I was rewarded with was knowing that there are, for example, several different ways to complete the first area. It's not a railroad; I just, to put it blunt, sucked. In fact, after discovering my first way though that beginning area... I went back in, and starting clearing out enemies, starting in order from most managable. It became an arms race of beating the lowest enemies I could find, surviving the encounter, and assimilating any loot I could find, up to and including the paintings on the walls. Then, I come up to what I'll call ""midway"" through the first act. Suddenly things are falling into place with the plot, and I'm gaining hints of what appears to be a really neat story in the making. The varied things you can encounter kept my interest once I had the skill to progress, managing gear was interesting due to the magic armor and physical armor differences, and limited resources forced me to make interesting decisions every time I came across a nice piece of gear in a shop. I began to learn of the various advantages and disadvantages inherent to different styles. Spreading your points can mean you have access to a ton of powerful toolbox abilities, but don't deal much damage. You can focus all your points into one aspect, and that character will be a high damage monster, but will lack in utility in comparison. Pair two such characters together, and your high damage will punch through the defenses of your victim, then the utility monster will knock them down for a turn, only to be put in the ground for good by your high damage character's second round. Essentially, what I'm saying is if you find yourself overwhelmed by this game like I was at first, I suggest you attempt to absorb what the game is beating into you, then try to use that to beat it back into the game. If you can manage that, the varied builds and playstyles as well as the interactive battle system may just capture your attention. Overall, this game is already something that I would consider great, and they're only in early access. They're still working on the game and the story, accepting feedback from the forums, and they're doing it well. Worth the full price now, can only get better from here. Would recommend.","January 2, 2017","86 people found this review helpful

They all feel balanced, they all work, and they're all perfectly acceptible ways to get through the game. So I'm getting creative. I want to break this perfect system. I'm sure there's a crack... somewhere. Next goal- the wall build. Build a character who can hold a lot, have them drop it all in a wall formation, use that to hold off melee attackers. Wait. Every class has a teleport skill of some point. And the melee class sets things on fire when they use theirs. CURSE YOU LAHRIAN STUDIOS! I didn't mean it. Big fan. As of my first time this game.

First character i made ended up deleting as i got into a fight i couldn't handle, burned my revives(had no recent save). I have talked two people into fighting to the death to settle a petty argument, had followers that have a blood feud, put out fires with raining blood, picked the pocket of my buddy online w/o him noticing, and spent 20 minutes the first time around on character creation. I've only just hit the first city as well. . . This game is just terrific. DO NOT GET ME WRONG, the fights can be really, really unforgiving(ofc i play in classic), but rewarding as well. 10/10 i'd murder that child again.","March 18, 2017","79 people found this review helpful

43,"I am incredibly excited to say that this game is all that I could have asked of Larian Studios. As someone who loves Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, etc, Divinity: Original Sin 2 simply blows my mind. The dialogue can be witty, comedic, even tongue-in-cheek, but at times it is also grim, dark, and serious. Each character has their own way of coping with situations, and you as the player must work to keep the group together. You can choose the class of all of your adventurers, and tweak your main character at the start screen - in effect, you can multiclass from the get-go. Abilities synergize and can create opportunities that can be exploited by other party members - or, if you're not careful, by the enemy! In terms of customization, the game is lovely. In summation, you can advance your character in a non-linear fashion if you so choose, but you might find it easier to create classes that are symbiotes (they benefit from each other's abilities). In terms of audio, the game is FANTASTIC. The voice acting is wonderfully immersive, and the sound effects are well-timed and well-orchestrated. Speaking of orchestas, the soundtrack is incredible. If you don't believe me, give it a listen on YouTube. The ability to choose which instrument will play at turning points of the campaign really gives you that feeling of audio customization, and lets you feel like you are in control of every aspect of the game. In short, I may sound like a ""yes-man"" when I wholeheartedly recommend this game. I may sound like there's nothing wrong with the game, but there are several bugs which are still unfixed and exploits that can be exposed to the savvy gamer. But, if you are like me, and you simply enjoy a game for what it has to offer (a complex storyline, diverse characters, entertaining combat, excellent audio, above-average graphics), then this game is for you!","September 15, 2017",48 people found this review helpful

48,"You know those games that are just a few tweaks away of greatness? The original Original Sin was that kind of game.It had modernised CRPG mechanics,great combat,lots of choices on how to get on with the world,wonderful crafting yet cumbersome UI and a muddled story (even with the Enhancements later released) Original Sin 2 tries to rectify all those mistakes. For my detailed review check this out: http://indiannoob.in/divinity-original-sin-2-review-pc-noobreview-dungeons-dragons-and-mashed-potatoes/ +For starters, it has a more straightforward and darker storyline and writing. +The UI has been refined and is a lot more accessible +Character creation, customistaion, companions are all great. +General gameplay is still solid packing deep environmental interaction(in&out combat),fun crafting and exciting turn-based combat with good animations. +Classes are varied and many and balanced very well +Pretty much all lines are voice acted and they do a decent job.Same with the soundtrack +Challenging Tactician difficulty in which the game should be played (Normal being too easy) +Game Master mode for PnP RPG simulation and co-op is fun as always +Game looks great with a more grounded art style this time around +Mod Support -I felt the streamlining of RPG attributes and skills from the first game is a bit of a let down (Although they allow less trial & error playthroughs) -The crafting seems to have been downplayed this time around.They have taken out the skills related to crafting and some fun recipes -Normal difficulty is way too easy,at least in the first chapter. -Tactician mode felt cheap in some aspect like when it gives enemy ridiculous amount of physical and magical the first game,higher diffiiculty meant more enemies and smarter A.I. TL:DR Orignal Sin 2 easily takes it's place as one of the greatest CRPGs ever along with Baldur's Gate,Fallout,Wasteland,Planescape:Torment etc and at the same time possess mastery over it's technical aspects something the afforementioned games never did possess.","December 15, 2017",81 people found this review helpful

50,"Divinity: original Sin 2 is a strong contender to ""Game of the Year"" and with few meaningful tweaks it could easily compete to rank among the best RPGs of all time. Like for its predecessor, its strong points are the massive amount of player agency permitted, one of the best turn-based combat systems in the business, a great degree of environmental interaction and very solid encounter design. Disappointingly enough, this sequel fails mostly in the same area that hindered its predecessor: itemization and stat bloat. Larian's stubbornness with randomized loot over unique and hand-placed items means you'll never get rewards that are meaningful, just generic items that can drop anywhere or pop in any merchant's inventory at any given time. That kills a lot of incentives to bring down strong enemies, solve quests and explore for hidden treasures: when every action can potentially get the same outcome, it doesn't really feel like accomplishments matter that much. On top of that, the problem with stat bloat emerges few hours into the game. While the problem presents itself from the beginning (by the time you'll get all the pieces of the first armor set in the starting area they'll be completely obsolete), it becomes genuinely grating past level 14-15, as you'll quickly get to the point where the jump in values at each level will be so ridiculous you'll literally double your HP/damage/armor values, etc. This essentially forces (well, strongly encourages) the players to replace ALL the equipment for his entire party at every level up. That's not just annoying and a bit pace-breaking, but it also has the not irrelevant side effect to make you feel like no piece of equipment you'll find, no matter how strong at that given moment, gives you any long-term value. There were surely better ways to handle these aspects, even just looking at the past. This game with the Baldur's Gate 2 itemization could have been a all-times classic.","November 25, 2017","80 people found this review helpful

51,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I played the first Divinity: Original Sin, and now I have played Divinity: Origin Sin 2 to completion (or to, at least, completion when it comes in terms of what is available in the alpha), and yet I am considering picking it up for a second run. The combat of this game is excellent, and - I believe - is its shining feature. And if you think you are particularly good at it there is now even a PvP arena in DOS 2. With that said, if you did not like DOS 1, you will probably not like DOS 2. The game is the same formula, practically the same combat system (with a few improvements and a few setbacks), and really the same story-quality of the first game. You might find the story a little disappointing if you bought into all the hype that Larian threw down about hiring so many writers, when really what you are looking at is pages and pages of written dialogue (no voice acting) that you will probably begin to skip through six hours into the game. And I say that as someone who loves books (Andrej Sapkowski's Blood of Elves is sitting right next to my keyboard). But, look on the brightside: it's still early access right? They could improve it... well, at least we can hope. While I certainly have enjoyed DOS 2 for its combat, graphics, and character design... the story is not going to win any awards if it stays in its current form. If that is going to be a deal breaker for you then I suggest you wait until the game is finished and see how it is then. But if a badass combat system is enough to draw you in, then I'll see you in the arena! (Oh, by the way, I should mention that the lizards in this game look really, REALLY badass... and sexy. :3)","September 20, 2016","37 people found this review helpful

An excellent and worthy successor to what was already one of the best RPGs ever created, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is perhaps the foremost of Game of the Year contenders and will remain one of the benchmarks of RPGs for years to come.","October 11, 2017",65 people found this review helpful

57,"DOS II is a herald to old rpgs from the 80s-90s. RPG’s like Fallout, Wasteland, Baldur’s Gate. All of them rewarded you with exploration, dialogue, minute journal-keeping and little to no quest markers. You relied on your wits alone to get you through the game. Choices mattered in those games. If you ♥♥♥♥ed up a quest, the game would make damn well sure you knew it – and felt it. Unlike most modern RPGs, Divinity is open-ended and not just with classes. You want to be a magic-wielding rogue? Go for it. Pure rogue that steals and kills everything that isn’t nailed down or moves? Go for it. The choice is yours! Be whatever mixture of class/skills that you want. What this game is is a love letter to rpgs of the past and it has little to no hand-holding. Pros: + graphically one of the most beautiful CRPGS I've played. Varied enviroments, painstaking details, vivid colors. + Written dialogue is very well done - characters have stories they're willing to tell + the story is intense; it leaves your morals confused and often conflicting + Incredible customization for characters. Skills, weapons, attributes. This really is a game that harks back to working your character out + Challenging. This isn’t your momma’s half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥RPG. This game WILL kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you don’t play your cards right + The world is massive and rewards players for exploring and roaming + Multiple solutions to quests. There isn’t one way to do everything. Find one solution you like? Quest on! Find another way that suits your fancy better? Game on. + Graphically very pleasing to look at! + Music is what you’d expect from a fantasy game and it’s pleasing to chill out and relax to + Party members are interesting and have their own backstories/quests + Multiplayer/Co-op! + Option for fast travel when you discover waypoints + VO's are nice but I've played the game for so long without them that I find the experience more enjoyable with it off completely + loot in certain vendors has changed or does change so there's always plenty of variety + crafting is so optional that you almost don't really have to bother with it unless you want to + The Gamemaster mode is probably the best thing since tabletop simulator + The freedom to do what you want in-game + Loot once you hit just before leaving Fort Joy and after is beyond plentiful + Variety of characters, both recruitable and NPCs alike are astounding; everyone has a story worth listening to Cons: - Gold can be hard to come by. Or... you know, cheat - A lack of direction can often be confusing; especially for gamers just getting into the game/series +/- Multiple quest solutions can be missed or completely over-looked.

I'm only halfway through this game. There's 4 acts and I just now got on act 3. So if I keep going around doing all the sidequests, messing around, and main story missions, that should add up to about another 250 hours of content.

60,"I will try to keep this review short and sweet. Generally speaking - I am not a fan of turn based games. I prefer real time RPG Combat found in games like Skryim, Fallout, and Witcher 3 (The GOAT). With that being said, even with it not being my favorite combat method, this game is INCREDIBLE. The story and choice making you can make is very similar to Fallout : New Vegas, where each dialogue matters and has an impact. In terms of replayability, you can choose across multiple ""Origin"" characters, who all have deep back stories and the ability for you to influence the future on a very large scheme. If you like RPGs where you get to make choices, this ranks up in the top 3 for me, which are Fallout : New Vegas, Witcher 3, and Divinity : Original Sin 2. If you've taken the time to read this entire review, take the plunge and invest the time in this game, because it is insanely good.",September 3,"69 people found this review helpful

61,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a true modern cRPG. Instead of just emulating the Infinity Engine itself, it preserves the old school soul and complexity, includes all the things you would expect from ye olden days, adds many positive surprises on top of it, then frames them into amazing shiny 3D visuals with functional UI and tons of convenience. Even though there is number 2 in the title, it can be played as a standalone game without prior knowledge of the previous OS, or others in the Divinity series. The game world is just packed with stuff to do - every few steps you bump into something new happening. And that’s above and below ground, as the game features quite a lot of caves, dungeons, ancient ruins, cellars, and even a pocket universe. The player has always plenty options to chose from how to proceed. Abilities like persuasion or lockpicking are really useful, and talking to animals is just awesome. The story is serious in tone, with many mature subplots, but it’s not lacking some needed moment to moment humor either (usually when doing side missions, not as unnecessary comic relief to main line). There are many memorable characters & situations. The companions are great and well fleshed out, each of them quite distinct. Their stories often intertwine with the main plot, so they all feel relevant. While the game is fantasy in nature, and there are plenty of things we’re used to, there are also many quirks and ideas unique only to this world. Enough for it to feel fresh most of the time. It’s not perfect though (but close). There are limits to what you can do, although there is very high chance you'll be able to execute most plans you come up with. The pacing was a little weird as well - the 2nd area with Driftwood was just too huge and not particularly structured. They might have been aiming at more open feel after the initial island, but it just turned out to be tiring by the end of it, and I couldn’t wait to get out of there. I’m aware that if I wasn’t a person hell bent on scouring every inch of the map, and doing absolutely everything, I might feel otherwise, but that’s just the way I like to play, so that part didn’t mesh well with my game style. I had to take a break a bit after that, but later areas, Nameless Isle and Arx were great again :) Part of that issue might have been due to combat, there was just too much of it for my taste. The combat at first is quite confusing, since many useful skills are too spread out between different lines, and it introduces some new concepts like surfaces. Then you get the hang of it, and it’s fun for some time, and later on you get overwhelmed by sheer amount if it. There are many epic fights all right, but at the same time, even though I appreciated the variety and scope of them, sometimes I just wanted to get it over with and progress a bit faster (turn based battles can take a while). But overall D:OS2 is simply outstanding. Highly recommended :)",February 8,"32 people found this review helpful

65,"EDIT: Below this edit is the original review I made during Early Access. Currently I would have to say 100% of my issues with the game in the early access were addressed even before the release. The AI has been improved to the point they make choices a skilled player may make. The Mass AP issue has been entirely resolved. The issue with certain skills not being balanced as in Hailstorm, Single Dagger and others have all been rebalanced and made entirely fair. To add to this they have outdone themselves by adding FULL voice acting in the game, something that was only in the first one after the enhanced edition. The mechanics for the undead are entirely fleshed out. The storyline is entirely fluid and fleshed out. I can honestly say this game has not only met but exceeded my every expectation is entirely justified in its price for the quality put into it. Larion Studios has released a game that shows what EARLY ACCESS should be used for and it's benefits. I whole heartedly look forward to their next game. EARLY ACCESS ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'll start by saying that I am well aware it's early access so some features are clearly not available as of yet. The game is indeed an improvement overall to the first game, the combat is more fluid and challenging however I do see an issue in the fact the AI seemingly has collosal amounts of AP and can walk halfway across the field and still attack. This was an issue in the first game as well though and not a fault in D:OS2. Even the very first goal of chapter one can be suceeded in so many ways including simple brute force if you happen to be a tactical genius. The added Highground vs Lowground bonus/penalty for ranged attacks in a great addition as it adds other dimension to the tactics in combat. My greatest complaint is really just a matter of not being able to test out the true customization of the character classes. I also admit that the first town in D:OS seemed to have so much more to do but I do enjoy the more serious and adult approach of D:OS2. All in all I genuinely believe the game is worth picking up, not necessarily saying people should buy it now at full price but it will definitely be a game worth playing with your friends. Albeit a very unforgiving game.","September 18, 2016",43 people found this review helpful

A minor nitpick. Simply put, Divinity Original Sin 2 IS that makes The Witcher 3 look like a generic open-world title. What you get is an impossibly interactive game world where every action seems possible, and has consequences with such a level of complexity and flexibility it’s difficult to believe it exists, let alone that it could ever be bettered. Its scope can be intimidating, but not overwhelming, and there’s usually a way to fix a mistake. And it’s that intimidating, ambitious scope, that dedication to player freedom, that makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so impressive. There isn’t another game right now that lets you do so much.

There are a few bugs here and there, but that is to be expected with a game in its Alpha stage. I love this game and I even purchased it for two of my friends, which they are addicted to now! I would highly reccomend this game to all RPG fans, and to any gamers for that matter. Pros: Fantastic Music Great Strategic gameplay Graphics are clean For being only Act 1, story is well fleshed out Great teamplay and multiplayer experience Great opportunity for role-playing Steep gameplay consequences (seriously) Cons: Occasional game breaking bugs (Save often!)

70,"[Updating review from Early Access] Almost all of the negative reviews of this game remark that they gave negative review for one of two reasons: 1. Game has too many bugs. 2. Game is too difficult. That first one is fair. There are a lot of bugs. I'm currently not actively playing it due to this. With this game's ambitious scope, bugs are expected. Although, relative to a Bethesda game, this game was practically bug-free at release. The second point, however, is just stupid. tl;dr: It's not. When you start the game, you choose your difficulty. If Tactician is too hard for you, play Classic. If Classic is too hard for you, play Explorer. If Explorer is too hard for you, I'm surprised you're able to operate a computer at all. I started one game on Explorer just to find something out that I couldn't where I was in my game (it was crafting related), and I was killing most things in one hit. How is this difficult for you? Honestly, I think it's just people playing on Tactitican because they think they're awesome, then get their asses handed to them because they're not. I've seen people claim that Act 1 is impossible on Tactician. Keep in mind that people had already beaten the entire game on Tactician when these claims were made. If you want an easy game, I would say that this game is not for you, but Explorer mode is available, and it is a really good game, so you should probably still play it. Another complaint I've seen, although it's rare, is about the level bloat. I agree with this complaint. There is way too big a difference between one level and the next, and the steepness of the curve makes it a lot worse. The game would be a lot better without it. I can understand the power increase from leveling being on a curve, as that's normal, but the curve is too damn high.","November 16, 2016","34 people found this review helpful

73,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Gorgeous game, so well written, even though early access it feels really polished. Initially the lack of voice acting was my only bane and still kind of is, but I can understand why with the amount of writers in this game as opposed to the first. Only 2 writers for Divinity Original Sin, there's triple that for this and voicing the game would take years. Conversations feel a lot more in depth too and I found myself voluntarily reading it as opposed to just skipping, which is what I ended up doing on Original Sin (not that it was boring, I loved the voice acting, just got very tedious in my opinion). Worth the money tbh, I am very proud to know that I am supporting Larian Studios on this journey. If you haven't got DOS2 and have been thinking about it for a while, it's worth it.","September 27, 2016","43 people found this review helpful

74,"Some pretty severe balancing problems really hurt this game on the harder difficulties at the moment I write this review. It definitely seems like melee-heavy parties are not very viable. I've restarted three times now and reduced my party's melee investment with each restart and I've been progressively enjoying the combat more as a result. Basically, melee at least so far in the first act, do not have mobility skills they need to do anything. Attacks of opportunity require a trait investment, which is kind of lame. It doesn't help armored enemies mitigate a lot of melee damage and that getting magic resistance as a fighter is difficult, resulting in a lot of annoying CC from numerous enemies. I've had to cheese a lot of my fights to win them (abusing conversation mechanics mostly) and it feels kind of bad. The game is still fun, but I would advise doing research about party composition before investing a lot of XP. Also, this game commits a lot of ""cardinal sins"" for me: 1. Persuading people down from fights...results in a net XP loss and no notable change in the story's outcome (at least so far); as far as I can tell, being a murderous bastard is the best way to play this (by far, even). Aside from meager barter prices I don't see a point in making a charismatic character. 2. You're encouarged to fight and kill trash for XP; at multiple parts in the first act instead of advancing the story like I wanted to, I was compelled to scour the area for more things to kill. If you like this, then this is the game for you. Reminds me a lot of Baldur's Gate in that regard. 3. Some party members, if you don't keep them on a short leash, will break quests for you by doing naughty things to NPCs. 4. Quests break...and there's no notification about it. It's basically a missing thread. It's kind of interesting this way, leaving you to figure out how to resolve the quest, but if there's no way to resolve it, you'll never know for sure. So be careful when you go murdering people who might be connected with a quest. This is definitely preferable over Skyrim's ""everyone is invulnerable"" bullcrap, but I'd like to know when I've royally ruined everything and should reload. 5. A lot of game mechanics aren't forshadowed at all (one of the early fights has turtles which...explode for a ton of damage when you kill them, really great surprise when you have a lot of melee in your party) and you'll be reloading after you experience them. 6. Numerous boss weapon drops so far for me have been inferior to standard stuff I find in shops. It's funny (not in a way I like), this one notable enemy I killed dropped a dagger which had a ""10% bleed chance"" mod on it - and that was supposed to be the draw for me using it I guess? In a turn based strategy game, ""10% anything"" might as well as not be there. There are a lot of other lukewarm mods on gear that might as well not be there or do anything. I've been vendoring a lot of stuff. 7. Gold isn't super abundant, so you will be picking up pots, pans, and kitchen sinks to make by. I've never liked this as it's just absolutely silly and tedious. Depsite my gripes, this is definitely a solid RPG and tactics game, at least the most of what we can expect from 2017.","September 16, 2017","80 people found this review helpful

80,"So I feel I have enough information to give a well-informed review now that I'm 36.2 hours in. I've been reading, however, that Immediate kudos for a content-packed game. Having played the original Divinity tile from 2002, I've seen this game develop from a Diablo-esque point-and-click action RPG to the turn-based strategy game that is now Divine Divinity: Original Sin 2. Although I've missed a game or two since then, I wasn't quite sure what the storyline was, but the game clearly helps you understand what's been going on in the world of Rivellon right from the start. The immediate immersion into the game has the amazing quality to have me asking questions and wanting to seek out the answers to those questions. I was compelled to keep playing as I see the story unfold and each decision leads to more tangled pieces of the web of mystery that I need to solve. The combat was easy to figure out immediately and I have to give Larian Studios another amazing pat on the back for integrating for a turn-based isometric RPG. One of my big turn-offs is that, although I've played for keyboard and mouse combo for many years, I like my gamepad much better and will not buy any titles that don't support it. There's some dispute about the Tactician mode and whether or not it's too hard. Having played 8 hours in Tactician mode, I finally discovered that if I wanted to enjoy the game and be able to progress in it, that I would have to play in Classic mode. Even in Classic Mode, the fights are still difficult and I've had to play a few of those, get killed multiple times, go level up my characters and improve my gear, and then finally win. Sometimes winning just barely with half my party killed. The character creation was a little strange from most RPGs I've played, since you aren't really locked into a particular class and you can be whatever you want, based on the allocation of your Talents and Skills. I chose to play as origin character Ifan ben-Mezd, since I wanted to find out more about the storyline and how people fit into it. The build-selection during character creation made it easy to figure out what Skills and Talents were appropriate for the style of play you wanted for your main character. I always choose a good combination of melee and magic, so Battlemage was perfect for me. Character dialogues have an added flair to them that give you extra choices based on certain tags you have or aquire or choices specific to certain origin characters. The voiceovers are amazing and abundant, even down to having your own personal narrator. Many RPGs don't put that level of artisitic detail into their games when it comes to audio choices. The environment is beautifully rendered and I enjoy it in full 4K resolution on my 65in. television. Full camera control with zoom in and out makes the environment easy to navigate. Overall notes about Divinity: Original Sin 2: * Content-packed (packed like it could rival the amount of content in Skyrim) * Mysterious and interesting storyline that makes you want to keep playing * Combat system is easy to figure out, but beware of Tactician Mode (was too hard for me) * Full Gamepad Support in a turn-based RPG (a rare find...I would play Tyranny if it had Gamepad support) * Detailed voiceovers and soothing soundtrack * Great-looking environment that scales well to 4K resolutions I hope this review helps someone!","October 7, 2017","51 people found this review helpful

The artwork is beautiful and the humor is there but not as goofy as the last game.

89,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 improves on almost everything gameplay wise from the first game. No longer do you have to deal with unfair elemental damage and debuffs that one-shot you, instead there's a new armour system that blocks this kind of damage more reliably, both physical and magical. This new system makes it so you manipulate the battlefield to your advantage more so than just spamming out CC spells on the enemies. Combat is a lot smoother as they are both extremely aggressive but at the same time tactical as you aim your attacks. With the new armour system you will rely more on throwables and the environment to lower the opponents armour so that you can start controlling them with stuns or burning them. A new addition are dialogue checks which are similar to the checks present in old isometric Fallout games where your statistics determine your ability to have a successful persuasion chance. Be careful who you use to talk to certain NPCs as now the checks are decided by your main stats and not only your persuasion stat. Now the game is out of early access I really have to commend Larian for creating a fantastic game. They changed a few of the early fights so that they aren't too broken but at the same time switching it up enough to still make it challengeing. The new additions of polymorph skills and generous placement of source as well as tons of crafting recipes really shows Larian's commitment to making an amazing game. Never before have I marveled at the magnificence and brilliance of an RPG as much as Divinity: Original Sin 2. The freedom, progression, story and overall game mechanics makes this one of the best games I've ever played.","January 25, 2017",19 people found this review helpful

I've been listening to some tracks repeatedly since first hearing them. One of the deepest RPGs in terms of choice.

And not just the illusion of choices, every situation you encounter has so many ways to get through that it's not too improbable to say you could most likely replay this game for thousands of hours and never get bored. This game is more or less dungeons & dragons in a game engine, while you could say other games are like dungeons & dragons this game practically IS dungeons & dragons, aside from the fact that unless you're playing game master mode you can't make things like persuasion checks in the midst of combat/etc. It would be an injustice to call this game anything but a masterpiece, it easily sits on top of the rpg world, rivaling all including possibly my #1 rpg of all time .

97,"C'mon, become Overwhelmingly Positive already! While at the time of writing this review, I haven't even gotten past the first Act yet, I nevertheless feel compelled to write a review for this beautiful game. For me the game's highlight is its excellently designed turn-based combat. There are no potentially pesky RNG elements and therefore every fight follows the same strict rules allowing you to have full control over how every battle plays out. There's also an insane amount of skills that are open to each and every character, and free to combine at your leisure (half of the fun is simply experimenting!). While the game is very very challenging (in a good and fair way!), I never felt the need to look up guides as with some thought you are more than able to compose your own diverse team of heroes (except maybe on hard difficulty - but don't play that until you finished Classic!). The voice acting is also superb, with tons and tons of spoken dialogue and different choices you can make. Also initiating a dialogue with another of your team members may open up a whole different story which may reveal more of the character you are interacting with or the world around you. Finally, the graphics look more than impressive enough considering the game's genre, and the level design has nothing to complain about. Admittedly, no game is without its flaws though and I will summarise my, minor, grievances here. Inventory management is still a hassle. It's a common issue for RPGs, and I'm not sure if there ever will be a game that's perfect in that regard, but with four party members, switching items to and fro, out and in of backpacks and the like, becomes a considerable hassle. Especially when it can be hard to discern between quest items, crafting materials, fluff, and junk. To add to that, civic skills like bartering and lucky charm (increases your chance to find rare items with that player only) are not group-wide, meaning that you will have to switch items (and gold) to and fro your characters yet again to reap the maximum gold and good gear. Frankly, I don't bother with the last two because it's a serious nuisance, and it doesn't really make the game too hard without. Nevertheless a fix to this inconvenience would be appreciated. Furthermore, certain skills are either useless - initiative: determines the play order during a fight for your team only, meaning that having one at 13, then 12, 11, 10 is sufficient and any extra points are basically lost, - or certain skills provide odd bonuses - warfare: a melee oriented skill that apparantly is the best damage increase for rangers as well (I do have a ranger in my team with 5 huntsman and 0 warfare however, and he's perfectly viable on Classic. I only need to make sure he's positioned with a height advantage, which is actually how the game intended rangers to be played). Last, but not least, there's no way to change party members during a conversation, meaning that if you are forced into a dialogue (probably because he/she was closest to the conversation starter) with someone and a persuasion check needs to be passed, it is impossible to have your player with skill in pursuasion take it over (this led to frequent quickloads for me). Basically during dialogue your team members turn into mutes unless they are scripted to take part in the conversation. I didn't intend for the second paragraph to be longer than the first, and I would recommend to pay more focus to the great things this game offers rather than the minor nuisances. I will give this game a higher rating once some (or all) of these issues are addressed, which I actually expect they will. TL;DR: A must buy even at full price! It currently has the well deserved spot of #10th best game ever! P.S. Feel free to reply to this review with questions; I usually reply rapidly. Also, if you decided to buy the game after reading this I'd be happy to help you out with the game, or play with you co-op if our times align! :) Will update this section once I have completed the game.","September 28, 2017","156 people found this review helpful

As an older gamer this is a massive throwback to the games I played as a kid, but if you're into hardcore non stop action games this is not the game for you. With that out of the way, if you're an RPG fan and you love getting lost in a ♥♥♥♥ed up and amazing world, this is the game for you.","November 18, 2016","21 people found this review helpful

103,"Do yourself a favor and buy it ASAP! One of the best cRPGs ever. Interesting story and main characters that you can bind with (unlike DOS 1), lots of side quests, tons of things to discover, hours of exploration, fully voice acted, upgraded AI, signature Larian humor/sarcasm, tactical combat, riddles, all combined with a great soundtrack. What else can you ask from a RPG? A true masterpiece.",February 7,"25 people found this review helpful

104,"Great RPG, probably one of the best games of 2017. It's strengths lie in an amusing colorful world, with and intresting, serious, yet lighthearted fantasy setting. The game is actually very rough around the edges the longer you play. It's polish runs out in the last 2 chapters as they feel rushed and maybe even unfinished. The difficulty curve of the game feels off since near the start it's very challenging, but towards the end you will become an unstoppable killing machine. Though there were many improvements over the first game, I still felt the first game had a better, focused story, better armor system, combat system (AP management) and pacing. Pros Lengthy RPG Large variety of skills and character customization options Dialogue is fun an intresting, a lot of world building in game Cons Overall a great game probably the GOTY, but I would reccomend people give the first game a chance beacuse I truly believe it is the better title between the two. A few of the characters and plot points carry over so it's worth taking into consideration before playing this game regardless. I feel like after a few patches, maybe an expansion, this game can be fixed up to be almost perfect, but for DOS is still the best example of kickstarter success and a modern CRPG with a classic taste to it.","December 14, 2017","25 people found this review helpful

108,"While there isn't a lot that hasn't already been addressed in other positive reviews, I feel obligated to address some of the negative reviews I continually see regarding the game's difficulty. Like any strategy-oriented game, Divinity Original Sin 2 requires quite a bit of premeditation before entering combat to guarantee success (outside of Tactician mode anyway, more on that later). The game expects you to use the tools it gives you in each encounter though the largest issue I've seen is when you enter a new section of the game. Before you go exploring to much it's almost mandatory to address the guaranteed difficulty creep by checking out any and all new gear/skillbooks/potions etc are available in whatever new social area you encounter. With the game's economy being what it is, having one character geared toward thievery and another set up with a significant amount of barter goes an incredibly long way toward alleviating the need to almost constantly upgrade your gear when entering a new section of the game. The point I'm making is that the game gives you all the tools you need to address any gear issues you might have the moment you set foot in a new town. This goes for skill books as well as there is no limit to how many books you can learn as long as you have the commensurate ranks in the associated skill and sufficient memory slots to equip them. Anyway, the TL;DR of all that is the game gives you all the tools you need to PREPARE for difficult fights so long as you actually use them. All that said, the AI isn't a slouch. It can and will abuse whatever environmental things are to hand and the devs have set up a great many of the fights to favor the enemies. This means that as a player the onus is on you to think about the party you want to put together before just trying to breeze through the game. There are so many ways to make strong characters in D:OS 2 that they're almost limitless. What you CAN'T do and expect to be successful is to just blindly charge into every fight and new situation with your d*** at full mast (just a turn of phrase, no offense intended ladies). If that's the playstyle you're after there are a dozen Diablo clones or ARPGs out there that are better suited to that frame of mind. D:OS2 has a turned-based system for a reason and is incredibly rewarding just so long as you apply some forethought to engagements. In fact, it's easily the best RPG I've played since the early 2000s in terms of gameplay. Panning a game for being difficult is a non-starter, especially when it's only as hard as you make it by lack of planning. Unless, of course, you're playing on Tactician mode. If you're doing that, you deserve whatever mental anguish you're suffering from because that is almost entirely designed for masochists who like to sit bare♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on a saguaro cactus. If that's you, by all means, buy stock in razor blades or whatever but I would seriously hope to not see any complaints about difficulty.","September 30, 2017","131 people found this review helpful

114,"40 hours in and I've finally left Fort Joy and reached the mainland. Says it all really. I thought I was quite far in but turns out I've just scratched the surface. The depth is awesome, this is really the first game of this specific genre I have played, and I'm glad I took the risk on it. Incredibly immersing enviroments, music, story and characters. You really feel part of this world. Combat is very deep and I actually restarted the game twice before I was happy enough with my build and companions. Takes a bit of time if you are new to this series to get used to how classes and roles work, and how you should be building your team, but once you get the hang of it, it's fairly straightforward. The only negative I felt was that the journal gave a lack of direction on quests and objectives in general, but as soon as you stop treating them like quests and more like parts of a dynamic story it doesn't really matter. You can fail some, or do things wrong and that's okay it's part of your story. Often doing the wrong thing can get you some nice loot or information that helps you in some other way. Love it.","October 5, 2017","71 people found this review helpful

Dos2 is a wonderfull adaptation of old d&d boardgames and classic video games like Fallout , Neverwinter Nights , Baldurs Gate , I would recomend this game to anyone who has been looking for a game that will challenge them.

Friendly NPC characters agro against you after the battle is over, even if the fire/poison etc. they are standing in, is of their own making. I have tried to keep several NPC's alive through fights only to have them turn against me during the conversation that automatically follows combat because they have taken damage from fire. Few other smaller issues I have noticed, occasionally characters abilities are greyed out during battle, quick save and reload seems to fix this. Random teleport bugs, you click to move and one or more of your characters instantly moves to another location far from the rest.","July 27, 2017","22 people found this review helpful

122,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW If you're looking for a roleplaying game with interesting and useful abilities both in AND out of combat this game is for you. If you're looking for an RPG with a deep, involved story across multiple characters this game is for you. If you're looking for an RPG where you feel powerful but are also constantly challenged to improve both in skill and level, then this game is for you. However this game is not for you if you are bored by dialogue, this game is not for you if you dislike complexity and having to actually learn how to play and this game is not for you if you you require instant gratification. For me, this game plays like a western version of a JRPG, with many characters to join your party, a deep complex story and many ways for you to affect the story. The combat is turn based which allows for more depth in the combat system and more strategic options. If you haven't tried turn based combat before, this is a great way to try it. It's like Diablo but for intelligent adults. Each origin character provides with a completely different gameplay experience even if you play them as the same class. Overall, as an RPG, I give DOSII a 10/10 on a curved scale. Unparalleled in the modern PC market and preferrable to the most recent console offering Final Fantasy 15.","September 9, 2017","29 people found this review helpful

126,"A rare case where the sequel is even better than the original. Put in over 100 hours on this game and loved nearly every minute of it. If you love story driven rpgs where the world you roam gives you adventure at every turn - this game is for you. Positives: The myraid of ways you can build a character. I opted for more of a ""Warden"" route and enjoyed the freedom of veering outside of the confines of the usually locked in advancement systems found elsewhere. The NPCs and their contribution to nearly every scene as well as their own storylines. I will admit I got a mod to allow me to take all of them along. Not so that the game would be easier but rather so I could experience all of their storylines in one playthrough. I was not disappointed. Best character development I have seen in an rpg in a long long time. How big and developed the world is. Nearly every corner has you encountering some mystery, npc, adventure, or clue. Sometimes it can even be a little overwhelming but with time and effort - you can start mapping out everything. The combat system. The built upon the previous one and improved its flaws. In the original, I would grenade and area effect arrow the hell out of everything. Sometimes allowed me to breeze through fights that should have required strategy. This time out - there isn't any overt easy tactics. In quite a few fights, you have to bring your strategy A game or die repeatedly. Negatives Some of the puzzles got too clever for themselves and go well outside of the established routines of how to solve them. While in some cases this worked well, there are quite a few that gave you no starting reference point of how to even begin to solve them. This can lead to quite a bit of frustration and then gets compounded with the occasional bug that pretty much leads to a roll back save to try a different approach just to avoid the bug. Endings. Big fan of anime here so I understand the idea of endings that aren't exactly clean but damn... the one that takes care of the most things literally nullifies the entire purpose of the game. I NEED some Malady DLC! In any event, highly recommend this game. One of the best I have ever played.",March 23,"25 people found this review helpful

128,"Product received for free EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Return to the wild world of Divinity, this time as the source hunted. Play as any one of 5 (..4) racially different heretics shipped off to magician auschwitz for the weekend. Help needy elves, recover lost oranges and walk around a prison camp fully armed in platemail without being noticed. It's up to you and a maximum of 3 friends who are hopefully not specced the same as your main character to finally learn the true difference between magic and sorcery. Really enjoyed the 15 or so hours I spent on the game, while there's dialogue and more gameplay complexity (crafting) to be added, the game is extremely functional as a demo and worth the support for the final product. Im stoked to see past act 1. Visually the game looks great and theres plenty of improvements that have been made to gameplay. Parties will open doors and climb ladders to travel long distance and combination classes are more intuitive and natural to skill. Waypoint distribution is more efficient and 'zones' are visually distinct to make it easier to navigate. There's plenty of little secrets and mysteries to keep you occupied while following questlines and I liked coming back to finish off a particular path or attempt a difficult fight at a higher level without feeling like I always had to. I often found myself cheesing through battles and puzzles I couldn't win fairly using increasingly underhanded tactics. Players are free to exploit Divinity's mechanics, a refreshing change, where most RPGs are concerned about limiting your ability to break the game, Divinity says ""♥♥♥♥ it, teleport that man, slip past that locked door"". Beating challenges in creative and logical ways immersed me in the world and was what got me so addictied to OS1. Quests are easier to follow and plan for than before in terms of following where to go next and what exactly it was that you were supposed to do now. Dialogue is currently under heavy development but hostile and friendly choices are already there and serve well to give you some influence over outcomes. Choices are still sometimes nicely ambigious while usually offering a 'safe' way to exit or press for more information about the choice. Quests make liberal use of previously completed quests, conversations and suspicious items to further reward and immerse players. Tracking objectives on the minimap is more consistent and the menu UI has recieved some much needed improvement. Combat and skills already feel mostly balanced, combination classes seemed much more viable than in OS (maybe just me), and AP and skills have been rebalanced to be more uniform. Mobility spells that were master level in OS are now novice so everyone spends less time walking around in combat. Basic attack and spell AP cost is no longer the same or higher than advanced skills and spells are priced more logically for their effect (no more AP 7 teleports). With no technical issues to complain about in my 20h playthrough, I can only have issues with the changes to memory slots and master spells. Instead of skill mastery affecting spell memory for that skill, spell memory is now allocated to an attribute stat. For people who liked their caster to have 5 action bars full almost immediately, bad luck, everyone in the party more consistent early on regarding their ability density. Additionally Master level spells now cost rare 'source points' to cast each time and cost an additional memory slot compared to novice and adept (2v1). While I understand that because memory has replaced the increasing point cost system of skills that it has to be relative, but no-one likes buying slots with attribute points directly. Also the nature of source as a resource (rare + necessary to open doors, activate shrines, progress the story) triggers my autism meaning I never wanted to cast Source Magic. Lastly, the loot system has stayed mostly the same, being predominantely randomly generated. Im hoping hand placement becomes more of a thing as the devs look to put more polish on the game as across both games players tended to collect a lot of crap. Completing a quest/dungeon should mean receiving a unique or relevant item given as a guarenteed reward, I often get nothing out of a quest but copped a top tier item from a fallen goon or box. tl;dr Hard game to complain about even in Alpha, one of the few games worth the price tag in early access.","December 8, 2016","39 people found this review helpful

129,"Divinity Original Sin 2. While Original Sin was already a good RPG game and had plenty to offer, I was a bit skeptical that whether or not Larian Studios could top that. But boy did they. Original Sin 2 is better than the first in every way. It’s safe to say that Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of the best, if not the best RPG of year,especially for us old school pen & paper rpg lovers. While RPG's are all about choices & consequences & development of your character,you don't find many PC RPG's that offer this kind of choices,where your decisions and actions are so impactful. Meaning, You can kill an NPC related to the main quest,try to steal from a vendor & loose access to their inventory,build your dream character or a good for nothing crew,the choices are limitless . There is always another way to take care of your duties if you fail in one. In other worlds, Larian was able to PUT THE R BACK IN RPG in this game. Another really strong aspect of Divinity Original Sin 2 is its characters,especially the SIX Origin Characters to choose from who have rich backstories and amazing voice-acting to boot. Similar to Dragon Age Origins,the Origins lets you play as unique characters with their own agendas & goals. And if you want to create a custom character,then fret not,you can have them as companions in your journey. One piece of advice though. There's a nasty piece of surprise waiting for you at the end of ACT 1. So choose & build your companions carefully. As far as gameplay is concerned, there’s nothing new or innovative in terms of gameplay, but rather, a refined version of what we’ve already had for years. The only thing complicated is stuff like crafting or spell combinations and such. But once you have a general idea of how they work, you’ll be breezing through them. The game also comes with an amazing soundtrack, very fitting for whatever situation you’re in. Additionally, the VFX sounds, be it for blood spatter or whatever fancy spell you’re flinging, and the sounds that the weird creatures and characters you come across make, it all fits right in place. Not to mention,the entire game is voice acted & makes the experience all the more enjoyable, especially for those experiencing the genre for the first time. Similarly, no complaints with the visuals. While it’s not an extremely graphic intensive by today’s standards, but still it delivers a very visually appealing experience. The environments look great and the details in the surroundings, be it inside a ship, or a cabin, or out in the open (anywhere really), is amazing. Overall, one will have a hard time finding another RPG like this one around. Divinity does a lot of things right and I have to hand it to Larian Studios for creating an RPG masterpiece here. The plethora of options that actually matter, the rich characters, the story itself, this game has a lot going for it. You won't & cannot go wrong with buying this game,whether on full price or on a deal. My Verdict 9.5/10. PS : Fund Divinity Original Sin 3 if they are going to create it in the future. What Larian has shown us so far, it is well worth to pay them the full price & something extra for their efforts.",January 14,13 people found this review helpful
130,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW If you've enjoyed the first Divinity: Original Sin, you owe it to yourself to pick up this one. Larian took everything that was great about the first game and made it even better. Word of warning though, it's easier to screw up in DOS2 than it is in DOS1. Literally a minute into the game you can either recruit or kill your first companion, simply depending on how you talk to them. Stealing mechanics changed from DOS1 -- both guards and whoever owns the item will actively seek out the thief (you), and should they find you red-handed, throw you in prison, attack or simply take the stolen merchandise, again depending on how you talk your way out of the situation. Fortunately even if you choose the violent option, the game is still perfectly playable. Merchants and civilians don't participate in the fight. I'd write more, but I think I'll just go ahead and play some more instead.","September 15, 2016",16 people found this review helpful
131,"Originally I wasn't going to review this game on this account because I have few hours on this account. However, reading through some of the reviews out there, I wanted to speak my piece. This game changes things from the previous game in the series. And some argue that it makes the game harder, forcing you to play as a certain type of character. However, I feel the need to point out that you are only forced into playing a certain way if you desire to be the absolute best possible character in the game. People say that mixed damage parties are not viable because of the armor system in the game. (If you are unaware, every character in the game has an amount of Physical Armor and Magical Armor. These armors prevent damage and certain effects until they are depleted.) However, me and a friend did a playthrough of this game, and we played as a mixed damage party. For those who are interested, we had: a Summoner who also had abilities in Aerothurge, Pyrokinetic and Geomancer. That was my main. a Ranger who focused on long range physical damage, but also dabbled in Pyrokinetic. That was my secondary character. a Rogue who focused almost entirely on Physical damage. That was my friend's main. a Cleric who used Hydrosophist and Warfare, and acted as our team's tank. That was my friends secondary character. The point of that is to show that we had a diverse build to our team. Sure, it may not have been the most effective. But do you know what it was? Fun. We had a lot of fun playing that party. So, before you get this game, ask yourself this. Do I want to be able to create a character who is unique to my playstyle, even if they are not necessarily the best? If you say yes, then you will enjoy this game. There are so many options for what you can do. However, if you want to build the best possible character, then unfortunately, you will likely be disappointed with how you will need to build a certain way. However, is that not what something being the best mean? If one object is better than all other objects of the same type, does that not mean that in that catagory, there is no other choice besides that one object? It is the same for looking at the builds in Divinity: Original Sin 2. Yes, one is better than all the other. However, if you only play to have the best build, then I think you are missing the entire point of the game. This game is meant to be a medium for telling a story, for sharing memories. While you can play the game alone, it is my belief that for the true experience of the game, you should play it with friends. And when you do, feel free to play however you desire. I will lead to some good laughs when you look back at it.",August 30,29 people found this review helpful

133,"A masterpiece It took me around 100 hours to finish the game. The world of Rivellon is both big and alluring. It was a joy to explore every single corner of it. Each battle was challenging, fun, made me use different tactics and I never got tired of fighting. The game balances roleplaying and combat perfectly. In some RPGs the combat is fine but the story and characters are what keep you playing. However in Original Sin 1 I didn't really care for the story while Original Sin 2 kept me interested at all times. It really improves on the lore, roleplaying and combat. It's definitely a good sequel and one of the best games of 2017. I only have two complaints: Romance had no effect on the ending and the amount of puzzles in the game. It would have taken me A LOT more than 100 hours to finish the game because of the puzzles. Now don't get me wrong. The puzzles are all interesting and well executed. There are some simple puzzles, moderate and very hard ones. I just don't have too much time to play video games and since there are so many puzzles in the game I had to resort to using Google way more than I'd like to admit. Now the romance and with it some minor spoilers ahead. I decided to romance Lohse. At the end of the game she asked me if I would like to travel the world with her and I can't answer her. All I can do is end the conversation and in the final cutscene the narrator tells me that she spent the rest of her life traveling Rivellon alone. Just dissapointing. But what is the game about? What's the story like? You have the ability to use Source - A powerful and outlawed magic. Magic used by the gods themselves. It's what gives them power. The game starts with you being captured by Magisters who hunt and imprison everyone who can use Source. They take you to an isolated prison island. While there you make new friends, discover an unbelievable truth about yourself and make interesting alliances while trying to escape the island. You will meet dragons, witches, paladins, underground fighting arenas, demons, trolls, ghosts and much, much more. You will also uncover conspiracies and astonishing secrets. Will you be the new Divine? The game itself plays alot like the recent XCOM games. It's basically a turn-based roleplaying game. Not to worry tho. You can still create a custom character and choose their stats, race, gender, and origin story or you can simply choose one of the pre-made characters. There's a wide variety of classes to choose from as well. All your favourate melee, ranged and magic classes are there. It also has Steam Workshop and modders have made some really interesting class mods that are worth checking out. However, if you enable mods you are not able to earn achivements. This, in my humble opinion, is a bit foolish. It's a singleplayer game and I should be allowed to have my fun however I want. The trainers still work and it has no leaderboards in it so I don't really support disabling achivements for mod users. It's a minor complaint but a complaint nonetheless. The game is well optimised and ran at a solid 60 frames per second at all times. I did experience two crashes during my playthrough but other than that I really didn't notice any other bugs or issues. Visually the game is lovely to look at and the soundtrack is marvelous. Don't go into it expecting remarkable next gen graphics though. It's a game I most definitely won't forget any time soon. I want a sequel and I want it now! A must play for every roleplaying fan and fans of the turn-based genre should give it a go as well.",October 17,12 people found this review helpful
134,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW My First review ever.. i usually dont do these.. but i just have to say.. if you buy this game you wont be disappointed.. It's challenging sometimes close to impossible, you gotta use your brain to make the fights easier. Just what i want in a game, not just about hacking and slashing.. you really have to strategise your setup. I literally LOVE this game and i just HAD to write a ""review"".. thank you, 10/10","February 28, 2017","41 people found this review helpful

135,"Product received for free I have to write a positive review for this one. I'v been playing video games for as long as I remember and this is one of the best games I've ever played. Right now I'm playing my fourth run and I can picture myself playing a couple more before I stop. I describe this game as a rpg-strategy game. You can explore, craft, talk to people like a regular rpg but the combat system is purely strategic. There are 6 characters with unique stories and quests plus several other custom characters that doesn't have specific interactions. The range of skills and builds you can manage is huge and there is so much to explore that if you like the genre you will have lots of playthroughts and several hours of fun. 11/10",April 5,"21 people found this review helpful

141,"The Game That Kept Me From Quitting Gaming Altogether DAMN, I was tired. Beaten and broken to my absolute core. Like Gandalf after the Balrog fight, I lay like roadkill on Gaming’s Last Stand. Left in the ditch by the ravenous, greedy games industry, all but forcing me to violently amputate myself from my hobby after so many years, my thoughts returned to me through the mist of my mind. Game publishers had made me hate gaming more and more with every Microtransaction, Gambling Lootbox, and übergreedy DLC-pettiness, rubbing their scummy hands together, waiting for their chance to turn me so desperate that I'd sell my mum's wheelchair just to be able to play the story of a single player game wholesale instead of in disgusting piece-meal chunks. Exhausted. Ready to let my hobby die. Clearing my head to drift forever into the mindless, mainstream, middle-aged hobbies of pathetic Rom-Coms so bad they have to tell you where to laugh, sports night with a team letting you down for 20 years straight, and pedantic tv-gameshow hosts as full of themselves as the CEOs and board members of todays’ AAA game companies. I had cried out for Mr. Newell, but he was nowhere to be seen. I called out for him again and again, desperately trying to summon the one time so great mythical Valve Overlord to give me a glimpse of Half-Life 3 or some other new IP, for a last incongruent attempt to restore my faith in The Greatest Hobby ever known. But Mr. Newell had sojourned to the evil gates of DOTA 2 many moons ago, and had never been seen since. Every Valve knave had followed their once and future king, but in their wake had only left silence for those few of us who still cared. Their footprints, all leading to DOTA 2, and not one leading back, had all but vanished. And amidst the Consumer Forest behind Valve Village, there was talk of another presence, only whispered in fear, between creeping darkness and depressive thoughts; Artifact... Artifact... The wind carried the promise of a terrible omen, of yet another unnecessary card game to come, assuring the deliverance of the final strike into the once golden, now charred, heart of gaming. And Mr. Newell never appeared in this, my darkest hour. The heroic saviour was lost to time and space as he had succumbed to The Void of Game Industry Indifference. My mind wandered. Valve Village lay in ruins. Long was the time since anyone had fixed anything on the barricades of Team Fortress, and the walls of Counter-Life: Grognard Operations' padded cells had crumbled, leaving demons and hell-outcasts running rampant and harassing any remaining villagers. There were rumors that some of the worst of these creatures had even snuck after Gabe through the gates of DOTA, in the Unholiest of Unholy joinings of good and evil, but none had heard back from them either. The Portals to the temple of Half-Life were rusted to a sad metal heap, and the temple they guarded had lied dormant for centuries with no Programmer Priests or Artist Acolytes left to work on the Half-Life religion. Valve Village was a ghost town. Dying at last, together with me. I felt my body getting numb. I knew I was close to exhaling my last breath of gaming. Doomed to never experience the warm freedom from pathetic corporate game publisher mind tricks. Never allowed again to experience the sheer joy of a great game not tormented by CEO and board member greed. I closed my eyes. I made my peace with everything. Accepting of Bobby Kotick’s miniscule loaf-member, mercilessly drilling down the insides of my throat and demolishing my gag reflex for all time. No more protesting Zenimax’ and Bethesda’s Pete Hines lying and lying, his nose getting longer and longer inbetween my butt cheeks as he denounced the fact that their new paid mods system is indeed paid mods. I let out a poor sigh as I came to terms with EA’s horror show, drowning me and their other customers in blank-white secrete of filthy business decisions, in amounts so vast they could shave their chiseled, unethical game publisher jawline in the mirroring reflection of my soaked forehead. Nothing mattered anymore. We, the customers, had lost. And as a single tear ran down my cheek, gaming was dead and gone forever. I embraced the darkness and muttered a final prayer to the gaming gods of old, before feeling a last remaining speckle of life vanish from my veins. My gamer soul was ready. I was to return home to 8bit, 16bit, Playstation and PC; to the 80s and 90s gaming heaven. Far away from the grotesque demonic onslaught hell here, far from the karmic injustice of game publishers burning the industry down until they had extinguished its last pittance of grace. I was ready. And darkness came. Then, movement. Not from me. Outside of me. A feather of light touched my eyes. A vague, finely tuned iota beam, shimmering onto my eyelids. It tormented my weak sight, but it was real! A light, a light! My body jolted as it shone towards me from the distant skies. My butt-crack ravaged, my throat sore, my forehead glistening with horrible, sticky Microtransaction DLC. I was not dead yet, there was a game title coming closer, flapping it's angel wings as it descended upon my old, withered gamer soul. And I could see the shape and the coming of Divinity: Original Sin 2 as the air around me became warmer and I felt life returning to me. Larian had come to my rescue. They would not let me fall to the demonic creature game publisher overlords. They would conquer this Normandy, they would sail this Pacific. They would go on until the end. And no micro DLC could stand in their way of delivering the atomic bomb which destiny would have in itself the strenght and honour to become 2017s GOTY. Long live Larian, the New Gamer Wine. The Future World Leader in cRPGs. The Youthful Lords of Gaming. Support this developer. Sell your kids, dogs, and a kidney if you must. But support them, please. Drop them a bundle of cash from a helicopter, write your will today and give it all to Larian. Or do something else more or less creative. But promise me you’ll support them. Game of the Year 2017 is here. Sorry to all other candidates; you had clever minds, firm bottoms and perky puppies, but when Larian is sporting the combinad sass of Audrey Horne, beauty of an elven princess and the lust of a thousand pornstars to entertain me, there just isn't any competition worth to be had anymore. We're getting married in the spring and you're all invited. I love life. I love you all. And I love games again.","September 23, 2017","132 people found this review helpful

143,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW [I played through the early access at November 7th] THE GOOD! + New races to play + No ""pawns"", so full 4-player Co-op available + Alot of improvements from the first game + Overall graphical upgrades + New special ability system THE BAD! - You always feel Overpowered - Stats need rebalancing. Going full initiative makes sure you always get to play first. You can kill all enemies before they have a first turn (on highest difficulty!) - Obvious huge gaps in item upgrades - Pickpocketing still way too broken (unlimited gold/all shopitems for free) - Having 1% magic armor is enough to stop all debuffs - Enemies too easy to crowd control (stun / freeze / knock down spam) - Rangers STILL do too much damage (very broken in first game) - No penalty for poor intelligence / low magic skill. Your spells will always land and you will always have 100% chance to crowd control. You can have a warrior/rogue/ranger hybrid mage. Having a pure mage is such a waste. - Whole game revolves around the ""teleport"" spell or simular transportation abilities - TOO many abilities that allow you to escape or move enemies. You can never get hit by melee enemies, and you can always teleport enemy ranger/mage infront of your melee team and just insta-kill them on highest difficulty. - Almost all of the quests are broken. If you don't do them in the correct order (which means you can't explore anything) you can never complete them. Even the final quest of Act 1 - When you start a fight, your characters run around and position them selves very awkwardly. Even if you pre-set them in high ground etc they will run down and just stand somewhere totally unconvenient - Sometimes the conversations always end in the same way, no matter what you choose to say. For example; you argue with an NPC. The outcome is exactly the same no matter if you win or lose the argument - Argument stats (intimidate, wits, intelligence etc) don't matter. If you have maxed out your strenght you will still lose intimidation checks vs. cowards, if that's what the game-designers intended. • All non-direct damage spells need to be nerfed alot. • Debuff vs. magic armor system needs to be reworked. • Conversations need to matter (it's an RPG for crying out loud..) • Exploring shouldn't be punished by breaking quests. • Crafting is totally pointless and needs to be reworked. • Pickpockets needs a huge nerf.. since the starting area I have had the best items available to me. There are alot of things that need improving and changing, obviously it being in EARLY ACCESS. I still recommend the game because I really enjoyed the first one and I know/hope they won't polish this one any less. Hoping they put alot of effort into balancing things out so I don't feel like a God at level 2 (on highest difficulty); I will probably rate the game when complete (and nerfed).","November 7, 2016","81 people found this review helpful

145,"it feels really overwhelming, in terms of 'wtf am i supposed to skill/ go/ do', but once you are comfortable with the basics, its really fun and you are able to enjoy the setting. A con though is that the difficulties isnt mere: More/Less HP or dmg, but the enemies changing their whole attack pattern. F.e. In tactician(hard) mode we hade a fight where they bursted our group in the first round with tons of elemental combos, when in Classic(normal) mode the same enemy encounter on the same level didnt use any element even once in the whole fight. Feeling whise its going from 'Naked in a Snowstorm' to 'Idle on a Caribbean Beach'. Thats only from Hard to Normal, cant imagine the Very Hard mode. I assume that even on Classic mode it gets a bit harder as the game continues, concidering my review takes place in the starting area.

146,"TL;DR. A damn crab on the beach is more deeper character than any NPC in Skyrim or Fallout 4 ever. Gameplay is so much more enjoyable and deeper than for example the Witcher series. Characters are relatable and funny like in Mass Effect games! Makes me so salty to think about it that they stuffed all this to one single indie title... PROS: After finishing my 14 hour tutorial (EDIT: NVM I'm STILL IN THE TUTORIAL) I can already say this game does everything right and I ducking love it! This is the game that made me belive in the game industry again. I didn't like turn based combat, until now. I didn't like isometric point of view, until now. I didn't care too much about ingame conversations, until now. An RPG game you can play with FRIENDS and even cause drama in the scale of Mario Kart! Dialogue is far from monotonic and doesn't take itself too seriously. Voice acting is excellent to the point I found myself stopping to listen to the dialogue even tho I had finished reading it a while ago. I haven't had this rewarding and brain stimulating singleplayer experience for as long as I can remember. I haven't enjoyed this deep, different and open ways of approach to different situations ever in a videogame before. If you're being like me and see all the reviews and think ""Should I buy this? What if I don't like it? It's so expensive"" JUST BUY IT IN THE NAME OF SOURCE! You won't regret it meow. CONS: -Can't play accordion. -Steals your life.","October 11, 2017","96 people found this review helpful

148,"This game was amazing. The complex combat kept pulling me back to it. The story was immersive. I am writing this review to warn you about the end. The game is amazing until you get to the end. The game all of a sudden wants to throw weird puzzle mechanics that just don't fit with the flow of the game. They are also really annoying. Some boss fights don't follow the combat mechanics but yet your party does. The bosses do like 10 things at once and get back all of their AP (action points) on their next turn. If you played it on lone wolf, then you are able to do it too, but reccommended for advance players. My last warning before you buy this beautiful game is that the game still has bugs in it. There are many quest that can glitch out resulting in you not getting the xp or the award for completing the quest. There is a large list of them and you can google them when the time comes. I only had the one quest bug on me when i played through the game. Others had at least 10 + quest bug out for them. Worth it to the very end.",August 3,10 people found this review helpful
149,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is a gem. Simply loving it! It has a fantastic storyline, in-depth characters and plots, and the systemic combat is very perfectly made. This game is a must-have.","October 12, 2017",19 people found this review helpful
150,"I played this game for only 15 hours, however, I would gladly replay the campaign with friends, or fight them in the Arena mode. Only the first Act is out for now, and despite that, even if I did not even do every available quest, I spent 15 hours on this game. That part of the campaign also happens to have good replayability, because every quest can be finished in a diverse number of ways. The gameplay, while lacking some polish and balance (not too long ago some skills were seriously overpowered), is impressive and looks like it's only going to get better. The story and the characters are well written, and endearing. The game managed to make me care about characters that I only met in one quest, which is indicative of its overall quality. In conclusion, despite the current version of the game being short, it is brilliant and shows a lot of promise. I applaud the people at Larian for their work, and I trust them to make this the awesome game I know it can be. Of course, you should only buy it in its current state if you want to support the developpers, as, in its current state, it is not worth 45€ I will update my review as soon as that changes, however. EDIT: Well, the game is out now, and boy, I wasn't disappointed. The two new playable characters, Fane and Beast, are every bit as interesting as the other ones, and bring their own little story line too. Many skills were added while others were re-balanced, mod support is here, and it seems that it can do absolutely amazing stuff, Game-Master Mode is pretty intuitive and easy to handle with a bit of practice, and combined with mod support, I think it's going to allow for a wide range of adventures and campaigns to be designed by aspiring GMs. Overall, while the UI can be clunky at times, it is well designed. I'm especially impressed by how Larian pulled off the controller controls and UI, it requires a bit of getting used to, but it works great. Local Coop is great too, and it means that you can more easily play with friends that could not necesaarily have bought the game. Overall, a fantastic game, that I recommend without hesitation.","October 25, 2016","13 people found this review helpful

152,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Short Version: The game is fudgin awsome, and in my opinion lives up to the Original Sin (hehe), Dialogue is better, Combat is slightly different but still just as fun, though the attributes still needs work and ballancing, the drop in multiplayer sucks massive Cysealean Fish gonads because of the almost non-existant host controls and no in-game voice chat that i could find, though in organized play can probably be the most awesome experience in the game because of the awesome saves that can happen with you and your friends. I rate the game a 9/10 with the multiplayer a 5/10. This review will be mainly on singleplayer gameplay, of which i have player over 24 hours during the writing of this review and i will try not to spoil or touch the main story, quests and puzzles. Gameplay 8.7/10 The gameplay, much like it's predescessor, is a turn based RPG a la classic fallout and in my experience is much faster paced than fallout and Divinity: Original sin. The difference in gameplay from Divinity: Original sin is that the action system is more compact, some attributes were replaced to make things more simpler, defence from physical and magical attacks as secondary ""health"" bars instead of %reduced, a character past system that gives you new dialogue, and that the dreaded rock paper scissor persuasion system is gone. Many sees the changes as a double edges sword as it removes the more familiar aspects of the game, but to me it was very easy to learn which may have been the intent of the studio and you can take this as a negative or a positive. Better than previous system in my opinion The player dialogue changes i very much appreciated, especially the removed rock paper scissor system, the character past dialogue is interesting and suprisingly incredibly useful as you can get minor help from NPCs, an example would be ""MINOR SPOILER"" . It's different though not much better than the previous system in my opinion. The gameplay and combat is still quite similar to it's predescessor, but much more fast paced and flashy, especially the new source magic though some of it can be underwhelming. Many of the combat changes seems to be based around the new magic and physical armor system, particularly the damage dealt within one round of combat seems to have been bumped up by a lot both NPC and playable characters compared to the older system. The difficulty around the armor system can sometimes be glaring because magic, to me, is a much greater threat than physical attacks because of the almost ridiculous amounts of dangerous magical effects that enemies utilize like compared to the physical debilitations, being the most dangerous physical ones. The good thing about the new system is that as long as you have the type of armor the effect/element affects the debilitation will only be applied when that armor bar is fully depleted, though some can see this as a negative since i actually liked the willpower/bodybuilding system. Physical combat is still a very good way to do focused damage on one particular enemy, but is more devastating on one with little to no physical armor as a well placed barrage of arrows and melee hits can dispatch those enemies very quickly, though the same can't be said for monsters fighting against the playable characters unless the players are underleveled, but a proper and well built team can still kill enemies 3 levels higher than them. Simplifying things doesn't mean better, this is a good example. Worse than the previous system but is still okay in my opinion. The attribute changes to me are weird, like dr seuss weird, wits being too good with it affecting initiative and perception, constitution does not affect anything other than health, memory not affecting anything other than amount of spells (in my opinion it should affect some dialogue or something out of combat), and intelligence, having the same problem with memory only affecting combat and spells with no change in dialogue or out of combat stuff, strength is still heavily affecting combat very useful for throwing and lifting stuff and other out of combat stuff but is still overtaken by telekenessis, finesse only seems to affect combat and theivery, all in all the attribute changes are pretty wonky compared to the previous game. oh boy. I've not played organized multiplayer but i can see it being incredibly fun. I've only played multiplayer once and it was drop in multiplayer, and first impressions are the most important especially for new players. There are very little controls for the host of the game, for a game based heavily based on teamwork and tactics there is no voice chat from what i can find, the kick function does not work properly because a player can just rejoin particularly trolls and greifers. A help bar and proper command console/tab for hosts can help tremendously, adding a function that ban players from the server, and an option for local voice chat can help drop in play by a lot.","March 29, 2017","13 people found this review helpful

I try to learn to fit in, get on with life, but I got in trouble and was thrown into prison which is odd since this is already a penal colony, so I guess this is technically super-jail? Anyway, I do find an escape tunnel but it's inhabited by giant fire-slugs. I try to sneak passed, but one of them catches me and demands to know what I'm doing. I'm trying to get the hell out of here. She says that's perfect and informs me that she is in fact royalty and in need of a messenger.

158,"I absolutely enjoyed every minute I put into DOS2, and would like to recommend this game to everyone who is reading this. But I don't want to be tediously lengthy because adding to the sea of praises for DOS2 is redundant. You search it up and you will find things everywhere like ""best pc game of 2017"", ""best RPG ever"", ""best game XXX've ever played"". They are all correct, and they have conviced many people to buy the game and share the amazing experience. But they haven't worked on you because you are still reading a nobody's review to decide whether this game is worth your money. So I guess I have to write a bit more You haven't played this game. Why? I get it. You saw some screenshots, watched some videos and probably you don't like some elements of the game. It's nothing like what you've played before, and you thought well it's not your type, doesn't suit your taste. I know, people are way too individualized. But, what defines your taste? Youtubers? Streamers? Friends? Game Studios? No. It's yours. A true gamer never stops exploring. Every once in a while you need to step out of your comfort zone and try something different. Yes, from what you've learned about this game, your prejudices are probably 100% accurate, but if you haven't tried it, please don't believe you won't like it. If you've had the patience to read thus far, stir up a bit of courage and buy this game. Just sit back, empty your mind, and DOS2 will expand it, then blow it up into pieces. If for some stupid reason you are still reluctant to try this game, it would be such a painful loss, a shame and a pity for both me and you. Because then apparently I have failed to convince you, and you would have missed the oppourtunity to enjoy hundreds of hours of divine entertainment that you could never obtain by other means. Lastly, for people who have completed and loved this game but haven't written a review, please do it.

Very good gameplay, multiple ways to solve quests, good side quests, a LOT of content, good replayability, nice musics, ... Fantastic journey to share with friends (Playing it alone is probably fun too though). It also has the GM mode which looks awesome, but I never tested it.",March 16,"15 people found this review helpful

162,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The depth of this game and the ridiculous amount of fun I had in every encounter allowed me to completely forget any odd glitches that come with an early access game. Though I could only play through one act, it took me almost a week to do so, with so many paths and so much to explore, and so many characters to create. I can only hope that Larian continues to flesh out this already rich experience and expand it. There's so much here, and so much potential. Improving upon everything I can think of from the first game, they've really done the RPG genre some justice. I anxiously await the full release of the game, and I hope they continue to work on it well beyond.","September 25, 2016","12 people found this review helpful

163,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game is incredible! I can't tell you though which game of the series is better, seeing that they are both AMAZING! I just wanted to give some feedback on the things I personally think are too overpowered. So I played as a elf warrior, and your race ability as elf is that you get 1 AP and + 25% dmg for some constitution. Then as a warrior you have enrage, which gives you 100% crit, and you can choose a talent called ""War Lord"" which enables you to get 2 AP back when you execute an enemy. With Warrior having 3 charges (Blitz Attack, Battering Ram and Phoenix Dive) which only cost 1 AP and Crippling Blow and Whirlwind as AoE you can easily solo pretty much everything. Those things in combination with the golden double handed axe you can buy from an NPC not that far into Fort Joy's story line you are just way too powerful compared to everything else. I mean pretty much all I did with Lohse and Sebille was relocating enemies using Teleportation and then just utterly demolishing everyone with my warrior. Red Prince was basically only there for the extra cc, allthough I found out that stacking physical armour on him and giving him Bracus' Helm and letting him learn Overpower is incredibly powerful aswell, seeing that he can shatter enemies' physical armour in an instance, making them an easy target for chain ccing them. So that was the part about warrior being too powerful, now I wanted to move to the part where I REALLY like the idea of two different types of armour (physical and magical) and them protecting you from negative status effects, BUT on the other hand it's just way too easy to abuse this mechanic into chain ccing everything, making the fights not really challenging at all. So in the end I wanted to say: Don't get me wrong, I really REALLY like the game and I was soooo frustrated when I cleared the first act that I had to wait until the actual release of the game, but I personally found those things that I listed too powerfull.","October 1, 2016","29 people found this review helpful

164,"After finishing the game (took me around 105 hours on classic mode while playing on MP with my friend) I have to admit the game is great. Going from soundtrack, to gameplay, and the story. Soundtrack : The music in the game is really good, the orchestral OST really makes the game, many locations and fight have fitting music for what they are. It's good to listen to the game OST even outside the game or use it in Roleplay sessions, I cannot add anything more to be honest... The soundtrack is truly great. Gameplay : The gameplay is really good, I love turn-based combat in games and it is very refined combat from the first game. You can use envinronment in your advantage, set up poison and during the combat light it on fire, set up barrles of oil and poison ready to be destroyed and many more things which I really love about the combat. The gameplay itself is very nice, camera movement is nice and you can move it around however you want, the dialogue menu is pretty good. My only gripe was inventory but it's because it was mess thanks to my own fault (but auto sort button is pretty nice) Story : It's good, great, awesome. The dialogues are very well written, the NPCs are ""alive"", it feels like they are real people, the talking with animals and them giving you quests is great addition to the game. Companions are also well written making it like you are adventuring actually with real people, with their own problems, agendas, interrupting talks sometimes to add something of their own. The game had as well really interesting plot twists in some places. I can wholeheartedly recommend the game, as it become one of my favorite RPG of all time, among Baldur's Gate, Fallout and Planescape Torment","October 21, 2017",9 people found this review helpful

166,"This is a 230 Hours review on Tactician. TLDR: This game is 10/10 and deserves a spot in the RPG Hall of Fame. IT is a must buy hands down. Pros: - Story: Amazing Introduction that ramps up to a very good confusing mid game meltdown and ends in emotional chaos. - Gameplay: Top Notch, skills, spells, interactions, AI, everything feels smooth and fights never get boring. - Length: You dont know when the game is finally over it is soooo long and thats a good thing - Difficulty: On Tactician the game starts absolutely brutal, towards the end it unfortunately becomes easier except a few exceptions who are crazy hard again. Cons: - Merchants: 1 Hour waiting to get a chance of new piece of gear, no gear leveling with you, lots of unique armors or weapons capped at level 18. You can fix this though by using mods but then you get no achievements. It's not noticeable until the very end but then you notice it very hardly, to the point you go afk for 1 hour to get some new gear. - Skills: Some skills felt lacking, especially the source skills resolve into 2-3 being better then all the others which makes you feel pidgeon holed since the enemies on harder diffs are going to spam you with the good stuff. Some skills npc's use cant be learned... also you cant make true new classes in the SDK currently which is a big downer - Story: I understand that with so many choices it gets more complex to keep track of everything, sometimes the game does not explain or give you a chance on understanding why a character in the story would do something. One example would be Gareth if you chose to destroy everyone but side with him always, he still will be opposing you at the end while not explaining why so yeah thats unfortunately not the only story let downs. - Thievery: only 1 pickpocket per NPC per character this is ridiculous by the astronomical prices you have to pay and the minimal gold you get for selling stuff.","October 7, 2017",17 people found this review helpful
167,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I played probably 200+ hours in D:OS (on GOG, gives me sads for no Steam achievements) pre- and post- the EE, so I'm, let's say, ""familiar"" with the games and the dev. The moment I saw this was in EA, I didn't even speak the words ""Shut up and take my money!"" I just shut up and paid. I highly recommend you do the same! I can say without reservation, this will be one of 2017's greatest games (T:ToN is going to be a close rival, no doubt), and this will probably become a game I spend many hundreds more hours in. (And now for an in-character moment, with my favorite Sourcerer, Ifan-ban-Mezd) Hmm, I want that ring he has but wow, it's expensive. Ok, smile, nod, just keep talking, ""hmm, mm-hmm, that's interesting... oranges you say... uh-huh"" ""(here, put on these two rings and go 'round behind him, then nip his best stuff)."" ""He had a couple of smallish, dangerous-looking things. Here, take 'em."" ""Yes, oh my, fascinating. Say, why don't we have a little trade?"" I sell him back his own stuff, and trade for that ring at a pittance. Later on, I'll kill him outright, and take back all the stuff we ""traded"". Role-playing is fun, and profitable! Once you master the mechanics, you can still see the 'gaminess' behind it all, but in truth, that doesn't really dimish the fun! Learning to think strategically, then planning your next run with min/max, then tailoring each *ahem* ""event"" to your advantage, this cycle never gets old! AND THIS IS ONLY THE ALPHA!! The updates from the Dev during EA have brought sweeping, wonderful changes, posted even with some bit of regularity. The videos are interesting and fun, and each update brings new elements to ... test. If you have ever enjoyed any parts of any role-playing or party-scale strategy game, buy D:OS2; you won't regret it! I'm stoked for the final release, and who knows, maybe they'll even do a full EE for this one (or maybe they'll just drop the full, voice-acted, massive epic on us all at once, in a surprise on release day; because that's just how awesome this team is!).","February 27, 2017","17 people found this review helpful

169,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is everything the first game was but better and more. There's more options character wise (many different races), more possible outcomes of events and your decisions, more spellls, more everything! The story is quite interesting, because this time around it seems to be more serious, dark and characters you meet (especially your companions) have their own unique storylines and motives which make you want to learn more about them, understand their POVs and interact with them (very reminiscent of the legendary Baldur's Gate games). After beating Act 1 I'm absolutely hooked and cannot help but wonder how their stories might unfold and what suprises await along the way. UPDATE: The full game has come out and just as I expected it's bloody brilliant. Made it past the zone from early acces and there's so much to do, so much content that it's overwhelming. Best RPG ever!!! The combat is more satisfying and rewarding than ever. It encourages creative thinking and approach to your encounters, as well as using the environment to your advantage. There's new spells and spell schools, including summoning and polymorph as well as many additions and positive changes to the old ones. The turn based battles feel a lot more fluid and engaging thanks to many mobility options characters got (grow wings and fly away, charge at your enemies or jump back - there's always an option). And of course You have the option to play the campaign with a buddy or a random person online. There's also a game master, dnd like mode coming which looks very promising. Exploration and experimenting with crafting and such is very rewarding and satisfying. The audio is stunning, with a remarkable main theme chorus music that I cannot help but to hum to myself as I wait for full release! Game let's you pick a favorite out of 4 instuments (oud, tamborine, bansuri and cello) the sounds of which get mixed in battle music as well as pivotal moments in your campaign, crafting a really memorable experience. As far as graphics go they definitely feel like an improvement. Especially the character models and the armor design are gorgeous, where in the first game characters felt small and rather generic looking, with not many visual changes affecting them along the way, this time around each character and race look unique, feel big, present and meaningful in the game's world. Landscapes are beautiful and monsters you encounter look nasty (in a good way) and threatening. Overall, I am very VERY impressed with what I experienced in the game and absolutely cannot reccommend this game enough. You can really tell the game was made with love, passion and care. (A very rare thing to find in modern games). This is, I swear the best RPG I've ever played.","September 8, 2017",11 people found this review helpful

171,"If you like Divinity: Original Sin, you'll LOVE this game. Plays like the first, but with a lot more to do in battles, around the world and interacting with NPCs and your party. Theres that same humor that the last game had, so youll still find those flavor items and people in the world. The graphics are beautiful and the world looks vibrant and captivating. The writing is as good, if not better then DSO, with an added narrator and voices with every NPC. Battles are like they were in the original, but they'd added more spells and abilites, as well as an armor mechanic for both physical and magical damage. Over all a great game 23.5 hours!","September 18, 2017",16 people found this review helpful
172,"I could not sing enough praises for this game. It's easily one of my favorite RPG's of all time! Larian Studios really knocked this one out of the park with stunning visuals, soundtrack, voice overs, story, near flawless newtwork and online co-op. The list goes on and on. I could only wish all game releases were this way, so rich and full, without extra fluffs or DLC's hiding bits and pieces of it away. About the only thing I could fault this for is not letting have the campaign assets for the GM mode, I want The Lady Vengeance map for a campaign darnit! This game is a 10 out of 10, great package, worth every penny, would recommend it to anyone who likes RPG's. Even more fun if you play with friends, lord knows we all laughed and cried we found out how volatile mixing poison and fire is. Hehe...","November 23, 2017",8 people found this review helpful
173,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Recommended. Very Recommended. Please note though: - Currently in early access. This is fine for me but you are currently only able to access the first act. There are plenty of bugs to be worked and features not yet added out as you would expect from an early access pre-beta release. That said, though, the first act is A+++ D:OS 2 is a turn based RPG based on gear, skill points and abilities, elements etc. A strategic game for sure. This was exactly the sort of game I was looking for and expecting as I was a huge fan of the original. This game manages to capture what made the original great and expand on it in so many ways, with the ability depth, more grim story and great style (even when running on a potato). There are plenty of features still to be implimented (such as local coop) as one would expect from an early access release. That said, however, you can be at ease as this is a company that has illustrated clearly in the past that they deliver big time on any promises made during the development period. Overall, if you're looking for a strategic, turn based RPG look no further.","January 23, 2017",8 people found this review helpful

175,"Paid some pimp in a tavern a 100 gold for a prostitude. Went up to the prostitude and had a long good talk about how she should actually be paying me for it, then said ""Now that we have established who is the most desireable here, i will take my leave"". She got mad and said i couldn't get a refund. Little did she know that i already had stolen my money back from her pimp. 10/10 Would steal from pimps and ♥♥♥♥ with prostitudes again. But in all honesty the game is great, the story is much easier to follow now that it is voice acted in my personal opinion. Upon reaching Reaper's Coast i have experianced some slight problems with perfomance, but other than that, the game has been going smoothly. The turn based combat gets spiced up by the ground effects, you can either make great use of those mechanics or they can be your doom. Saving before battle is recommended. When combat gets challenging there is no shame in reloading a save to come up with new strategies to defeat your foe. Running from combat might also be the smartest move in some situations. The origin characters give a nice dynamic to the singleplayer game, having them in your party leads to some memorable events between you and them. When you interract with an npc they have interrest in, they will let you know, you can either allow them to do their buisness or keep them away. This will lead to you bonding with that character. If they do something you do not like, you can often have a talk about it afterwards. The music in the game is pretty good, but sometimes there is some mishaps where a piece of music that is out place plays. Nothing gamebreaking, but you can lose a bit of your immersion. You are able to pick 1 of 4 instruments when you make a character, you will hear these instruments being played in the level up music and etc. Persuasion checks have been a little confusing for me, sometimes when i believe i definantly should be able to pass the skill check for an option i fail and other times where i think i should have failed, i passed. No idea if it is randomized or how it works.","September 26, 2017","44 people found this review helpful

178,"It's a turn-based isometric RPG which attempts to do what Sword Coast Legends never did: make a computer game that captured the essence of PnP, complete with campaign editor (not tried yet, since this is an EA review), GM mode and true RPG-freedom-of-choice. It is very similar to RPG's of old, like Neverwinter Nights, Baldurs Gate etc. I have only completed Act 1 so far, since that's all that exists in the early access version, but I am hooked. The game is a joy to play. Difficult at times, yet rewarding too. It offers true freedom of choice in the way you play and create your character. It features a classless character system so you are free to do whatever you want with your character. It also features various ""origin"" characters which are kind of pre-generated characters with fleshed out backgrounds (the kind of thing you do yourself in a D&D campaign). You can choose to play one of those or alternatively make up your own and recruit them in game. There are many ways to solve the quests in game, offering a lot of replay value. Race, ""tags"" (such as Outlaw etc.) all make NPC's treat you differently and offer various other ways to do things. The co-op gameplay (up to 4 players) has also been specifically designed with this in mind, meaning your party may not always see eye-to-eye on things. This creates the potential for some interesting RP scenarios. Although the version I played does not yet feature a GM mode or level editor, this looks to be the icing on the cake and could significantly increase play-time. They will also offer Steam Workshop support for ""click-and-play"" modding. Now all they need to do is offer the ability to import/export characters... Overwhelming to begin with, but once you get to grips with the game mechanics you realise just how well crafted this game is. Gorgeous graphics, wonderful sound and music, solid turn-based tactical combat and endless replay value.","September 11, 2017",10 people found this review helpful

180,I would compare this game to the show death note where the first half is absolutley amazing but the second half is lackluster. The first half of the game in driftwood there are so many quests and things to do each quest just as interesting as the last with an immersive city that feels like its lived in but then in the second half when your're on the 3rd island idk what happened it lost its magic with an island where all you do is pray infront of stones and there are no other quests than the one main storyline. When you reach arx after that very dissapointing island it gets a bit better there are some quests to do other than the main story and they are interesting as well. The combat through the entire game is great. Good progression to feel like your character is truly ready to become divine and if you play this game with a friend it is a great experience that for me kept me wanting to play this game till the end. This game is definitly worth the first 40 hours to immerse yourself in the world however the 3rd and 4th island of the game falls short to the rest.,August 5,"15 people found this review helpful

185,"This game is fantastic. One of the best RPGs I’ve played. Larian created a rich and living world to play in. The story (unlike the DOS1) is good with twists and turns. There are tons of side quest and normally multi ways to finish them. (yes, murdering everyone is an option… but then you might miss out on more story/exp.) The interaction of “systems” they setup, from how elements react with other elements/spells to actions in the world people see you do. It makes for great combat and a lot of creative way how to deal with enemy/issues. I did play the first game (Divinity Original Sin) so I had an idea of how the game worked. (side note, there is no reason to play the first game. While great, it task soooo long to get going that many players will bounce off it.) I didn’t find the game or it’s systems confusing because of that.. maybe? Do not expect the game to tell you explicitly how to play. It isn’t “hardcore” that you need to just work it out yourself. It will subttlely tell you how to play via the interface. My advice is take it slow. This is one of those games that you search everyone, read everything, talk to everyone.  Save a lot. (f5 key) Not because it is hard, but you might change to change how some event is going once you see what is happening. Honestly my biggest “problem” with the game is a massive fear that I’m going to miss something. (which you can totally do.. it is very easy.) Did I miss some book? I did not ask the right question? Did I have a skill to low and missed seeing some hidden item/switch/etc… argh! That said, there is so much here it isn’t a big deal to miss some side stuff. But.. but.. I want to see it all.. so.. there is some stress there. Getting to the last big area was very stressful for me as I started to feel overwhilemd The quest log isn’t super great. It isn’t always clear what the next steps are… but in the defense of the game it really isn’t a check list of this but more a log of what you are doing. (but it would still be nice if they said if X quest is going to end of it leave area Y or if it will keep going.) Totally get this magical game, but do expect to bump into a learning curve if you’ve not play RPGs before. (of course there is an “explorer” (or something like that) which might be a way to get into the game a little ez’r.) There is co-op in the game too.. but I personally don’t see how that would be fun. Each person in your party is a part of your strategy. Well, at least play with someone you know and not a rando. ) Most people will restart the game after a few hours after they get an idea how the party they want and rolls/skills they want. But don’t super stress it. After you leave the first island you’ll be able to re-roll all you people skills/stats/etc (and as any times as you want.. free. The game isn’t setup to screw you over if you made a bad choice.","October 16, 2017",7 people found this review helpful

187,"Why exactly you are reading reviews for Divinity: Original Sin 2? I doubt you were just browsing store. You were looking for RPG, don’t you? Or maybe you’ve heard somewhere about this phenomenal game and just checking out. Or maybe you don’t actually trust this unstoppable hype train, do you? TL; DR. Buy. Play. Replay. Get Enhanced for free. Replay. Well, every praised thing you might have heard about this outstanding game is 100% true. My life is now divided into “before” and “after” Divinity: Original Sin 2. Larian Studios - creators of Divinity - is company of people, that actually works with players and for players. I will remind you, it is an indie project financed on a crowdfunding platform. Game has inherited all the best parts from previous instance. However, it is an understatement to tell that OS2 improved things. Sequel has added so much more, it has surpassed every existing game and doubled, tripled the level of today’s RPGs, adding everything we didn’t dare to dream about. We want to choose playable races! - Ok, here’s four. And you can make a playable undead character. We want more companions! - Fine. And they are living humans - play with three of your friends. We want more magic and perks! - Here 4 more skill schools and mix them up to unlock more perks. We want to make love to our party members! - No problem. You also can punch ‘em in a face anytime. We want personal quests! - Welcome playable characters with prewritten origins and their own story arc. We want more stories! - Here’s Game Master mode and dedicated modding support. Everyone knows, how much time it takes sometimes to create your character: skills, abilities, talents, etc. Eventually it took me twice as much, because I just couldn’t stop admiring visual design of characters, feasting my eyes while scrolling different races and skill presets, to see as character’s model switches his looks. In addition to looks and technical part of your avatar, there are two notable things in character creation. First, if you build your own character (not pre-created), you can add some personality traits, which together with race will reflect on your social interactions (i.e. dialog options). Second, choose one of four musical instruments - game’s musical score will dynamically change leading instrument, when your character does something awesome. Imagine epic cello or bansuri solo when your hero is unleashing some hell on pity enemies! More to this: do not bother with perfect build, try fresh ideas, experiments and bold choices - Divinity will allow you to change your specs midgame numerous times if you think you’ve messed up. Combat system maybe the one thing that has changed heavily in sequel, a lot of things were reconsidered. For me personally it was hard to get used to changes right after first game, but in hours I’ve found it even more satisfying. However, keep in mind that straightforward face punching still not the option. Tactics has moved into third dimension - do not underestimate high ground. And of course, don’t forget to utilize everything you can reach, that’s including you pockets and your surroundings. Found yourself standing fenced in a fire - use water barrel to extinguish it or bless fire and stand your fight in cleansing flames. Got bullied by a brute - teleport yourself out, or teleport enemy’s sorry♥♥♥♥♥on lava. Some of most efficient tactics are those that not first come to mind. Plot isn’t connected to Original Sin. Sequel is provided with its own overarching narrative and several personal story arcs of origin characters (which also serve as companions) and particular factions. Everything is interconnected in some complicated manner, it was the reason of bugs and some general frustration, because one path leads to impasse on other story thread (fixed by further patching). However, game doesn’t hold your hand and never questions your approach to advance the story. E.g., first thing you are tasked with after tutorial section - get out of concentration camp, and then you can look for someone to help you with this, help others for info on how to get out, murder your way out, lie your way out, or fly away, if you have the ability, without even meeting anyone. Plot progression is not just 3-4 options, but absolutely non-linear. Basically, you can roam where the wind blows the whole game, you will always find yourself on a right path. World of Rivellon has changed. At first, after whole shiny hunky-dory previous game, it was tough to find yourself in a place that is harsh, cruel and mean as Wild West. People will lie to you, use you, and you absolutely will find yourself in a situation, where the line between good and evil is blurred into wide grey area, where all alignments are subjective. Look, I have lost the faith in what I had been doing halfway through and have to reconsider my view on things - it is impressive storytelling for a video game. Music in game is kept on astonishing level, with memorable scores and even few actual songs, that are closely tied to game’s narrative. Soundtrack is notably adaptative to surroundings and players interactions. Thousands of lines of dialogs were voiced perfectly, with distinct accents and proper manners respective to in-game personalities. Surprising addition is in-game Narrator, that makes you journey more immersive and closer to tabletop gaming. Narrator’s commentary on things are so neat and detailed, you can basically enjoy your ride with eyes closed. Persuasion, as a vital part in RPG gameplay, has changed. Creators ditched that awkward “rock, paper, scissors” minigame, though there is no any kind of randomizer behind now. However, success not solely depends on your persuasion skill level: very neat thing is involving physical attributes into check, like trying to reason with someone adds your intelligence bonus, while intimidating is much easier with high strength. Most of the game earlier criticism was based on overabundance of bugs, inconsistencies and even script deadlocks. However, Larian never stopped patching and fixing and up all holes and mistakes, therefore every month after release players received long lists of patch notes. As for now most of things are shiny, polished and perfectly balanced. Moreso, Larian is readying an Enhanced Edition for release, where everything is refined and glossy, and with reworked third and fourth chapters of the story, which got their fair share of judgement from players. No point of waiting for release, as owners of current version will receive a new one. Divinity OS2 requires your time and energy investment. There is so much in this phenomenal game, you are not able to treat it as a casual walk in a park. Managing characters party, inventory and crafting, diving deep into each story, heck, even most of the important combat encounters are challenging and will take a lot more time that you think, with all the tactical possibilities. However, if you are ready to enter immense world of fantasy, magic, political intrigue, adventure, love and betrayal - there is no better way than playing Divinity: Original Sin 2.",July 4,"9 people found this review helpful

188,"Best thing I played for years UPD: I just wondering why I loved it so much. Among the other reasons, I really appreciate Larian merchandise politics. I don't want to put my thinget on some developers and studios, but Larian never trying to sell decorative itms, pets, game divided into parts called ""DLC"" (I'm not talking about real DCL like ""Hellfire"" for Diablo II or Bllod and Wine for Witcher III). They would earn a lot of mony selling staff like this, but they never did. And some words for development team: If you reading this review, if you ever reeading reviews, no matter who you are, leading devloper, or community manager, or guy bringing coffe, I wish to thank you. For your enthusiasm, for time spending on this game, for all of the inspiration you put onto and I've taken from this game. For all your love feeling in every mechanic of the game, in evry character taking a part in the story, in every single fight, for all hard desisions for players. For the world reacting on my actions, for the rich lore - legacy of the previous games you took care about, for the cats, and undeads, and undead cats,. You are amazing. You didn't create a story, but you ctreated history. Thank you/","September 23, 2017",16 people found this review helpful
189,"Man, it's so good. They took what was already the most flexible, fun, and modern CRPG out there and made the engine even more expansive and the game weirder and more interesting. I would actually recommend playing the first one first if you haven't; it's not really needed for plot reasons (there are a few returning characters but nothing major) but it's a little easier to get a handle on, hardly any less impressive, and in the meantime this sequel could probably still use another few months of polish patches. It's hardly anything to hold against it given the scope, and I didn't hit a single bug I'd consider really significant, but the farther you get into the game the more broken the quest flags start to feel and the more minor continuity issues the dialogue starts to have and the more combat balance starts to break. This is all after like 30+ hours, mind you (I'm up to 50 and not quite done yet, which is unheard of for me).","October 3, 2017",13 people found this review helpful

196,"This game is amazing. I can't stop playing it. Let's start out with the first thing you do in the game; character customization. You have 4 races to choose from, each with their own unique traits, backstory, and affect how everyone treats you. Lizards can dig without a shovel, Dwarves can crawl into small spaces nobody else can, Elves can eat body parts to learn the memories of the fallen (sometimes gaining skills in the process), and so forth. You've got a lot of choices for playstyles as well, and it's not set in stone. You could start off the game as a wizard, then transition into a battlemage who charges into the fray, then unleashes spells that require proximity. Then, you've got the Tags. Basically, they let you set up your own backstory, as well as giving additional dialogue options when the time is right. Mystics can sometimes talk to the gods, whilst Barbarians want a *simple* solution to many problems. But the best is yet to come... and it's something that I'm a bit of a sucker for. Music. You can set the lead instrument on the soundtrack. It's only four instruments, and the one you choose will be, well, the prominent instrument throughout the soundtrack. Not a fan of character customization? That's fine, you can select an Origin character. These guys normally would be optional party members if you were to create your own character, but you can also play as them for your main character. The choices are really interesting too; a lizard who cavorted with demons and got exiled, wanting to reclaim his empire; or a human who is a host of all kinds of spirits while a demon is trying to wrest control of her body. They all have pre-set tags, but you can choose the class they start with. Now for the gameplay. Out of battle, stuff is simple; everything is performed from your clicking (duh). However, even outside of combat your skills are still tested. Persuasion can be a way to get out of a fight, or get more information out of someone, bartering lowers prices for you. You can also steal stuff too, but be warned if you played the first game; the stealing has been revamped by quite a lot. You can no longer just walk into someone's house, close the door and sneak about, stealing everything that isn't bolted down. The moment you take something, no matter if you're sneaking or not, the townsfolk will become suspicious and try to search you. Of course, there's ways to make sure they don't succeed, but I'll leave that since a lot of this game is about finding your own playstyle. The combat is not really changed by much from the first game, but many more complexities have been added. Surfaces play a crucial role to a mage just like before, however they have many more options due to the magic trees. Water can be frozen, electrified, or turned into steam which can also be electrified. Bless can actually turn surfaces, well, blessed, healing characters who travel through it. (That includes everyone, so make sure blessed surfaces can't be accessed by the enemy.) However, there is also Cursed surfaces, which carry extra effects to them. Necrofire can't be put out by normal water, Cursed Oil can go off on MOVEMENT, and so forth. Armor is no longer a stat that simply decreases damage received, it is instead its own bar. This bar is crucial to manage, as it stops status effects. Think of it as a shield; as long as you have a shield up, you can't be affected by the status of a surface your character may be standing on, with certain exceptions as Oil that slows you down. As a general rule of thumb however, the game's combat is very challenging. There really isn't many fights that have ""cannon fodder"" enemies; everyone is dangerous and they all know how to take advantage of the same things you do. Be careful about that water you're standing on, for that mage on higher ground likely might have an electric spell he could cast, if your magic armor is down, and stun you. My recommendation? This game deserves all the praise that it's got and more. The only real complaint I have is with the camera control, but that's mainly due to my mouse having issues with some games not registering the middle mouse click. Plus, in battle you can get a top-down view if there's too many obstacles.","October 6, 2017","6 people found this review helpful

204,"TL;DR: The turn based combat is epic in ways I wouldn't have considered possible (prior to the original game). On that note, play the first game first, it's great, and if you like it then come to this one. The two big notes I have about this game are that it's dumb you can freely respec, and tactician mode is a major dissapointment compared to tactician mode in the first game. It's predominantly just an enemy stat buff (+50% to damage, vitality, and armor) and that's about it. It's most just artificial difficulty for if you played the game through a few times and want to have it challenge you again. Overall I like it a lot, but I admit I don't quite love it like I did the first game.","December 12, 2016",6 people found this review helpful
205,"This game is really a master piece in the RPG genre in modern times. Simply put it is a charming game with wonderful enviroment in a world that is deeper than one might think. It takes silly bit to far at times but never as far as lets say Borderlands 2 did which to me, ruined the whole game. Original Sin 2 is both a silly and grim story. The turnbased combat is excellent and it works so well with others. Prepare for a lot of backstabs if you play with nasty people! And prepare for twists. There is not a better multiplayer RPG this side of Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2. The builds you can do are plenty and races bring their own special abilities, especially Elf and Undead have some unique mechanics, like eating body parts to gain memories of the dead and even abilities at times or Undead....being Undead. There is at times some weird things. Like AI going nuts and doing not so optimal things or certain questlines not working correctly. RPGs with long questlines that the player sometimes managed to screw up by circumventing things by being cheesy is a classic thing in RPGs, The more advanced endings and options for a questline, the more keen to it breaking it is. Beside these problems, Original Sin 2 is a excellent game, with nice character building, this is probably one of the strongest parts of the game! Just going nuts when it comes to builds. NPCs that are not so bad, Interesting characters and a developed world. Only thing I would want is a longer end act. The last settlement you are in could been a bit bigger to symbolize the size of it. For the next game I hope to more of the same, even if it has to be crazy AI and questlines that is not always triggered in the correct way. I hope to see a Original Sin 3 in the coming years. EDIT: I must point out that the issues could all stem from us taking breaks over a month at times which could off have broken things between patches. The game usually works very well otherwise.",May 2,8 people found this review helpful

214,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW The worst aspect of playing this in Early Access is that even though you're getting to play the game - you still have to wait until they release the final, finished version. It's going to be tough to wait it out. Because now I know just how good it will be. The game plays much like the first - just better. It's design, the more polished and tweaked systems. I've been playing with a friend who is new to the series and honestly I laugh when I tell him about some of the systems in place. ""Yeah so you can teleport that bad guy and drop him on that bad guy and they'll both get hurt."" Or ""Right, did you pick up that corpse's leg? Oh, well pick it up and we'll take it to an Elf so they can eat and tell us where to go next."" Or ""I'm not sure what to do, we might want to talk to that cat."" Lol. Playing this game by yourself is great - playing with another person, or better in a larger group... man this game is gold. I've still got a lot of play left in this game - but I dread finishing it and having to wait for the rest. So I'm taking my time. If I can spend a couple of extra hours where someone else would take only 1 I'll be a happy bunny. Anyways, if you like this sort of game (and honestly who wouldn't?) do yourself a favour and pick this up for you and a friend. Just remember to come into it with the knowledge you're going to have to wait until next year for the full thing.","September 16, 2016","12 people found this review helpful

215,EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I loved Divinity: Original Sin both in Co-op and Single player. The first time I played it was that same feeling in D&D when you realise you can do nearly anything. Divinity: Original Sin 2 carries on this legacy incredibly well already considering it's early state. In the short time I've played I met a host of weird and interesting characters. Stumbled upon various quests that aren't just in plain site. This is the way I love my RPG's this game rewards you for exploring and taking risks. Just because the odds seem against you does not mean they are as long as you use the environment to your advantage. Blood puddles on the floor can become electrified to shock people on them. You can contaminate them to poison people and use fire to cause poison to combust. It's a wonderful game that I feel like will improve on the original in every way once it's finished. The early version does contain bugs and is obviously missing many aspects but if you wanna just mess around with builds or the new PvP modes then now is as good a time to jump in as any as long as you realise its not fully fleshed out YET. High recommendation from me for all RPG fans. Here's some Gameplay if you wish to see more and I may consider making this a series with enough interest otherwise I check back every few updates.,"September 15, 2016",16 people found this review helpful

227,"This game legitimately surprised me, I was having fun in the Early Access without the full extent of the game being there but I could've never imagined it would be this in-depth. The voice acting, the gameplay and graphics, the storyline... EVERYTHING! The game is incredibly engaging, probably one of the most engaging strategy RPGs I've seen to date, and it already feels like a proper sequel to the first Original Sin game by a long shot. It's clear to see with Divinity Original Sin 2 that it has a great deal of replayability and that there are many ways to go about each and every situation. The combat feels seamless and full of action, especially with the ability to use our environment to our advantage. Each battle presents a challenge that forces you to strategize each and every action. Or risk possible sudden death for your party members. The voice acting makes the conversations bearable to sit through and allows you to pay attention to what's going on in the storyline and in all of the individual characters stories and react accordingly. Not to mention that (without spoilers) the storyline will keep you on your toes and wondering what comes next. Not to mention you can experience this game with 3 other players! Each player just doubles/triples/quad's the experience and it only gets better and better as time goes on. In conclusion! Gameplay: 9.5 (Nobody does Turn-based Strategy Combat quite like Larian Studios) Story: 9 so far (Only in Act 1 at the moment) Replayability: 8 (You could beat this at least 2-3 times in a row without getting bored imo) Sound: 9.8 (Voice acting is on point, combat sound effects and music are fantastic, magnifique) Graphics: 10/10 (The cities, the swamps, the forests, the fires, the waters... OH GOD the WATERS!!!) I hereby recommend this game!","September 14, 2017",5 people found this review helpful

229,"One of the best games that I have ever played. The sheer amount of content and versatility of quest pathways is already worth the price of entry, and on top of that, the dialogue and voice acting are top notch (keep an eye out for conversations with animals using the pet pal talent, which run the gamut from hilarious to heartrending). I'm just about to start my second playthrough, and choosing which origin character to use this time around is going to be tough!","November 19, 2017",5 people found this review helpful
230,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW What can I say... if you loved the first Divinity game, you will feel right at home. There are some bugs here and there, but that is to be expected of an alpha version. The game looks beautiful and runs smooth AF on a gtx970 on max settings. I have nothing overly negative to say about this title. Just cannot wait for the full game!","October 31, 2016","7 people found this review helpful

231,"I have never been more ambivalent about a game before in my life. I have never played a game with such amazing concepts and potential, squandered by fundamental failings of game design. The fine first, second, and third acts, while plagued with the issues I am going to discuss, are not nearly as horrible as the absolutely baffling experience of act 4. All issues previously felt in the game are so excacerbated in act 4, that I thought I was playing an entirely different game. 1. The armor system incentivizes perversely unfun tactics. With the recent changes of taunt, they have thankfully recognized this. Nonetheless, it causes both the players and the AI to initially launch into DEFCON 1 tier nuclear exchange, with the victor emerging as the one to freeze, knockdown, or terrify (fittingly, the most terrifying effect constantly abused by the AI) their opponent. When the encounters start becoming quite difficult, this exchange can pretty much decide the outcome of the battle in 2 turns. 2. The AI in this game is awful. They are completely incapable of working to together and effectively chaining combos. So, in compensation, the developers have simply cheated ridiculous stats onto the AI, often allowing them 6 AP regen per turn, insane armor values, and a divinity level capability of using source. At one instance, a random AI sourcerer had an initiative of 50... why? It inexplicably had a base initiative of +20... If you encounter an enemy called 'nemisis,' evacuate to your nearest fallout shelter because they deserve the title of godwoken over all else. 3. Rapid descent into over-designed gimmick encounters, often with no communication of what to do. Act 4 is especially egregious about this. I have no idea why they decided endlessly respawning enemies, ambushes, and gimmick bosses were good ways of designing a game, but it is not. It shows complete insecurity in their combat system that they needed to replace every regular fight with some poor attempt at twisting the formula. Ultimately, it either ends with the player figuring out the gimmick and beating the encounter easily, or a frustrating cycle of save cheesing until the correct tactic is found. Its like... the previous 3 courses of this game's meal was just a delicious italian dinner, and instead of desert being a logical extension of what came before it, its dog diarrhea plated to look like chocolate mousse... yeah... its unique, but its ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just like every late game fight in this game. Unfortunately, the game's stellar writing was unable to save the experience for me. I honestly recommend turning on explorer mode if you do decide that is what you want to get out of this game.",February 26,"7 people found this review helpful

232,"I don't tend to write reviews for I think opinions are quite personal. However I must say this game has exceded all my expectations, and they were quite high to be honest. Pros: - Fully customizable characters: stats, talents, skills, equipment... you can play whatever personalized hero you can think of. - Great graphics: it may not be high-end graphics, but are pretty good and would make the game playable in ultra spec in any computer - Deep story: I have only put 18 hours to the game and I haven't yet advanced outside the starting area. So many characters, so many stories and so many places to explore - Open world: go wherever you want, the game guides you in a very slight way allowing you to wander around as you may please - Decissions matter: every dialoge option will have an impact on the outcome of the conversation and the story. Every character has unique dialogue options with the same character, making the game deeper and more realistic. - Turn-based Combat mechanics focused on tactics over clicking like nuts - Great soundtrack - Deep crafting mechanics - 360º camera + tactical view mode (top down) Cons: - Can be hard to get into. Lacks some more explanation of the mechanics at the beginning - If you missclick a talent or skill point you cannot take it back - Sometimes sound gets a bit laggy For me this game is a must have. 10/10",March 31,5 people found this review helpful
233,"Short Version: RPG, Yes, BUY IT! Long Version: Divinity Original Sin is a masterpiece in how to make an old school RPG bang up to date. Now before you say it was not perfect, let me say there is no such thing as perfection, we seek it and hopefully never find it. DOA was brilliant and that is a fact, not an opinion. DOA2 well its ""more of the same"", and I know when people usually say that it is followed by a sigh and resignation and usually ""Uh"". However not in the case of DOA2 it does all the DOA tick boxes but adds more, and I mean more in a very good way. An example is when you start out in DOA2 you will find that crafting plays an important part of getting better equipment to survive. There are even more ways to complete quests and some ways you can avoid quests, for example there are various ways to leave and some require a clever tongue others brute force or stealth and so much more. The character backgrounds are an interesting and tease you with a more interesting and some quite meaningful motivation for escape and progression. If this opening chapter is anything to go by then all I can say is ""more of the same"", YES PLEASE!...So put it on your wishlist or buy it.","October 3, 2016",19 people found this review helpful
234,"Product received for free EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game is amazing and an upgrade in pretty much every aspect from its predecessor. The graphical style has been shifted from slightly cartoonish to a somewhat more realistic this time around. A lot of people have enjoyed the comical look and feel of the previous game, me included, but I do have to say I prefer what they are doing now for one simple reason: the love put into every little detail art-wise is staggering. Every item has a nice icon when picked up and everything is lovingly detailed while in the actual world and not in your inventory. A simple example would be the health potions (or any potions, for that matter). Put them on the ground, zoom in as far as you can and admire the interestingly shaped flask adorned with gems and golden inserts. This attention to detail translates to armours for your characters (and NPCs) as well. I can hardly remember the last time I was so excited about finding new gear and seeing it on my characters in a game. But the good news does not stop there. Because the sequel now has an option to select your race (human, elf, dwarf, lizard, undead), they all come with their own armour style. This means a leather chest piece will have a completely different and unique look depending on which race you put it on. The humans are what we could most relate to, the elves are clad in natural-looking clothing made of twigs, leaves, feathers and so on. The lizards, being a proud and aloof race, reflect this in the beautiful and exquisite-looking armour they wear. One thing that immediately jumped out at me when I first played the game was how crisp and colourful everything was. Zooming in as far as I could, I quickly found the culprit - the textures have been much, much improved this time around. No longer is zooming in only a way to try and spot that possibly hidden trap door under a rug. It's now also completely fine to truly enjoy the attention to textures (and thus details) on various surfaces and items. I have personally enjoyed the music in the first Original Sin. After the unfortunate passing of the composer, Original Sin 2 has a new composer, whose music you might have heard in games like Crysis 2. And I have to say I adore the soundtrack. The instruments picked are fitting, the tracks ranging from calm, dark, creepy, cheery and so on, but all having a pretty epic feel. All I can say is - I have found myself just standing in an area to listen to the music and enjoy the surroundings. But oh, dear. I'm dragging this out and I haven't even gotten to the gameplay part. Like before (and rightfully so), this game is staying firmly in the turn-based combat shoes with a hefty slice of RPG elements to top it off. The developers have recently changed how the base stats work, which make improving them much more meaningful and give satisfaction when leveling up. Combat is enjoyable, although currently somewhat broken as the improved AI can sometimes like to stun-lock you with various combnations of crowd control spells and abilities. But that's simply something they will be polishing and changing before release. Having said that, combat is fun, the animation (while still work in progress and unfinished) fun to watch, as are the surface effects where you can electrify a pool of water or blood, slow down enemies with oil and then ignite it, etc. There is currently no voice acting in the game but it is planned, although I believe Larian have said there will not be full voice acting due to the sheer amount of text in the game. As for the latter, the dialogues are enjoyable and the story more serious this time around. However, there are still parts of the game where I got quite a good laugh, so fear not - the comedy relief is still present here and there. I could go on and on and on. But the simple matter of fact is, if you enjoyed the previous game, you will most likely love this one. If you haven't played the previous game but enjoy games such as Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity, this will be right up your alley. The amount of polish is astonishing, the music is beautiful and so is the art direction. The only downside is that the game is not yet finished and the wait is killing me! Be aware that, at the time of writing this (02.21.2017), the game ONLY includes the first act, so you can not play through the game in its entirety at all.","February 21, 2017","17 people found this review helpful

Since this is early access there are a lot of missing sounds and also the narration doesn't seem to be complete yet. I have my hopes way up for this game as I really LOVED divinity original sin. Haven't really played much of this one aside from the beginning area and all I can say is it looks better than the first game and there are some nice changes as well. I like how fortify is similar to stoneskin from old RPG games like neverwinter nights. Only personal grip I have are the elves. They remind me of the Na'Vi from avatar.

243,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Having backed the first one on Kicksarter and owning it on PC and Xbox One, I was already sold on the sequel but even with it being an Alpha version at the moment it's already showing how great the final game will be. My PC can only handle it on Medium but it's still really pretty and run smooth. The first thing that will hit you though is how magical the soundtrack is. The people who did the music really knocked it out of the park. One of the new feature is the Origin Story which is basically premade characters with independant questlines meaning that if you play with someone and you choose a different character than you'll have things to do that the other won't and the same for them. I'm not a big fan of fixed character but the story of the one I went with (Lohse) is pretty interesting so far. Even if you choose one of the Origin Stories you still can customize your character's hair, hair color, Skin color, facetype and class. I haven't played a lot but I'm already hooked. It's a game still in Alpha and it's better than some I've seen in final state. Larian Studio have showed that they make quality games and this is no different. I highly recommend the game.","September 15, 2016","13 people found this review helpful

My original thought's going into this game was that it would be the same as every other, with progression gradually getting easier until I reach the point that I would have no problem killing everything, but no matter how hard I tried I constantly had to redo some of the fights, to really learn the tactics and how the game works. The game exceeded my expectations by far and I would definetly recommed this game to any fan of dungeons and dragons, especially with the new game master feature comming out soon, this could very well revolutionise D&D as we know it.","May 9, 2017","14 people found this review helpful

253,"Divinity 2: Original Sin is beautiful, with a great soundtrack and the world design is also appealing. But i'm not gonna recommend it and here's why. The game counters it's own logic. Tells you to do whatever you wants, put an emphasis on freedom, character creation, dialogue, roleplay, etc, but you must play EXACTLY like the developpers intended you to if you wanna succeed. That means, finishing as much quests as you can so your level is high enough for you to be able to win fights on your own terms. So the optional quests are in fact, mandatory. You don't like some quests ? Too bad, since you cannot grind because the mobs don't respawn. But that's not the whole story about quests. The maps are quite open, giving you the illusion of freedom, but when you discover a map for the first time, you'll realise that most of it is gated by high level mobs that are going to kill you outright if you engage combat against them, thus restricting the exploration the game strangely emphases, and forcing your hand into doing things in the exact order the devs wanted you to do them. If you try to do quest B before quest A, you will die because of how much a one or two level difference with your opponent means. That's not to mention the fact that some quests are gated behind a perk/stat/item requirment. It's like Cat Mario / Syobon Action, where you have levels loaded with traps and obstacles you can't possibly anticipate, so you finish them by dying on every single obstacle at least once and memorizing safe zones. The combat system is also restricting, because of the way armor works, it's much more rewarding to set up all your characters into doing one type of damage (physical or magical) to finish fights quicker. I wanted a wizard to support my knight but that would have been a bad idea. Because why would anyone lose time into emptying a full magical armor bar if the physical one has been grinded to zero through the physical attacks you already delivered ? Being able to do damage by mixing chemicals and using the environment is a good idea, the bad thing is that those chain-reactions are usually triggered early in the fight, be it by your own attacks or your opponent's, at a time where armors are not destroyed yet, thus nullifying many effects or debuffs they could create. Nobody is sitting there, being like ""Omg this game is too hard, i can't advance !"" - people ARE advancing, but it is tedious and annoying. Not because it is ""omg, so oldschool, so hardcore"", but because the game fails to hold true to it's own principles and employs point-&-click adventure logic in many places. You are supposed to magically know how the devs wants you to approach a particular quest, area or fight. If you don't, you are going to fail, miss things, and die a lot. A good example of that would be Braccus pants. An item you can only find if your character is over a certain threshold in a certain stat, and make him interact with a particular item at a particular place, while nothing pointed that you should do that. There is a difference between not holding the player's hand and dumping them into a situation that cannot be managed unless you already have first hand experience or information. So yeah, i wanted to love this game but it is simply not amusing. It's not a challenge in the sense that you have to improve your level of comprehension of mechanics that make sense, it's simply a matter of knowing things in advance. In Dark Souls, you can win fights on your own terms by, let's say, becoming very good at avoiding attacks and counter-attacking. Or you can be a god at min-maxing, setting up stats the right way to make a great build that's gonna make the game much easier. In DoS:2, you cannot win on your own terms. I should not have to steal every painting in the game to keep my economy flowing so i can buy gear to stay relevant in battle. I should not have to kill every non-quest related NPC so i can grind all the XP not to get crushed in battle. I should not have to back-stab bosses without talking to them and miss important story elements or sacrifice my amusement because of cheesy tactics being the only way to win some fights. This ""You have to know it before you even attempt"" mechanic is not bad as is. I have no real problem with games that does that, however, i have one if they advertise themselves as putting the emphasis on player choice while it's clearly not how the game is designed to be played.",February 25,"41 people found this review helpful

261,"Almost copy/paste of the original DoS2 review, this has been updated for the new edition. I could just about copy and paste my D:OS review for D:OS 2. The short versions is that if you liked D:OS you'll like 2. If you didn't enjoy the first you won't like the second. So if you have experience with the first title, there's your answer. You can stop reading now. The rest of this review is aimed at those who haven't played the first game. I thought the first was a GOTY contender in 2014 and I think #2 is a GOTY contender in 2017. But it's going to get tougher to keep recommeding this series when the same bugs and flaws keep showing up. So let's start with those flaws. 1. The obscure quests still remain from the original and you often have no idea how to move a quest forward or where to go next. The quest log is still quite useless. Some quests are quite obscure looking for objects that you may have uncovered (or not) including at least one with an object from a prior area. 2. Some screens are too much of a pixel hunt and the highlight button doesn't highlight most objects. 3. The difficulty curve is, frankly, stupid. Larian still needs to tone down the difficulty on lower difficulty levels and smooth the curve. You will likely hit problems in the low teens and then the endgame battles are stupid difficult. 4,. BUGS. Larian still can't test out bugs for♥♥♥♥♥♥ For instance, I finally won the final battle...only to have the game keep me in combat meaning I had to do the whole frickin' thing all over again. I finally got through it again and the voice-over proceeded to give me the wrong ending. DAMN IT LARIAN, YOU HAD ONE JOB! Now on to the good stuff. Like the first game, this game has the best turn-based combat ever to appear in a RPG. This is the meat of the game and it's sooooo tasty. There are many options on how to approach a battle, so many builds and so many tactics that it's impossible to even scrape the surface in a review. Literally no other RPG gives you this kind of build and combat flexibility. Every encounter is a combat puzzle and most of them are fun. Sometimes an encounter seems impossible and then you figure out a strategy to make it relatively easy. This series remains the high-water mark of RPG combat and you could play it many times with many different builds because they play so differently. The AI is quite good to the point of being frustrating. You can - and will - get stun locked in certain battles (frustrating!). As I said, this is the core of the game. The rest of the game is good too, even if it doesn't quite measure up to the combat excellence. The back stories of the starting characters are great and your party members seem to be far more developed this time. The voice acting has been consistently great and the music and sounds are still top-notch. The environments are quite beautiful and quite detailed though they are sometimes so busy the game delves into a pixel hunt. The races are really quite neat and there's a couple here that are fairly original which isn't easy to do in an RPG. The RPG aspects just feel more fully fleshed out in this version. The synergy between the NPCs doesn't seem to be very good to start but after a few rough bumps the first two levels it's easier to figure out how you want to blend your party. Truthfully, I haven't seen much in the Dev Cut that I didn't recall from the original but I'm sure there's some new stuff. DoS2 is a step forward from the original and both are excellent games. Recommended for any RPG fan.","September 21, 2017",6 people found this review helpful

263,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW One of the most immersive RPG's I have ever played, although it's only a part of Act I the world in Divinity feels ro rich in life and lore. Playing classic mode is just about right in terms of difficulty the turn based combat makes it super complex, it's both easy to understand but hard to master. Combat is super tactical you will find yourself struggling to keep your party at bay fighting hordes of enemies. The enemy A.I. feels natural as if you where actually facing a big threat in the dungeons, but it balances out with how good you level up and build your party. There's a bunch of stuff you can do while in combat such as positioning and combining different elements to your advantage but it's still very fun and doesnt feel repetitive. The crafting gets a little confusing, dont know if it's because I haven't found many recipes but through combining you pretty much go blindly into it and expect to get soom goodies such as consumables and learn the recipe. The decision making in this game is pretty much a big deal, since it signifcantly affects the people you interact with and the outcome of any conversation related to your actions or thoughts. For an early access game its 10 times better than any mediocre regurgitated unpolished garbage on steam. The Core gameplay will be fighting and looting corpses to get stronger, but you will find yourself with a lot of quests from various NPC'S and sub-story lines. Although I felt a little insecure with how quests didnt show any markers on the map or minimap it is very immersive that while chatting with NPC'S they can pin point a location of interest in the quest if the person you're talking to actually knows about it, instead of just telling you to do something and you as a player just feel like you are going through rails while discovering quests. The amount of time I spent reading and nitpicking through my journal and conversations was just about right, not too confusing but not too easy, the game really does a great job at treating you as a competent player. While its easy to get lost on objectives and questlines you can always go back to the conversations you've had with your journal. The Soundtrack is Amazing you wont even feel it bothering you when jogging or fighting through the maps various and diverse locations. Overall I said everything I had to although, I had encountered various bugs but nothing a good checkpoint cant fix and I cannot wait for the full realease. A very good experience for a fan of the genre. I think most people should have a fun time, but its far better when playing with your friends and having a blast. Interactivity with the world and the attention to detail that Larian studios has made is superb, trully a nice gem to be found. I strongly recommend you get this game if you are into gaming in general.","September 11, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

268,"I bought this game knowing nothing about the franchise or of its background. My friends wanted to play it as it had co-op and looked pretty nice from the screenshots we had, so we all picked it up and gave it a go. 50 hours later, we eventually managed to finish our first playthrough, and what I came out with is one of the most enjoyable game experiences I have ever had, and without a shadow of a doubt my game of the year for 2017. First of all, I did not expect the writing or voice-acting to be as good as it is. There is a lot of genuinely captivating moments the game has and a good amount of decisions you can make, either as an individual or as a party. You really do feel like you are on this grand adventure, and you essentially make your own story (even if you play as one of the origin characters) which is awesome. Now, I think I need to get onto what is the most amazing part of this game: the gameplay. On the surface it seems quite simple, and it isn't exactly difficult as you have plenty of time to make decisions and your abilities clearly show what you can and cannot do in your current position. But if you take the time to experiment with things, you can discover new things that can entirely change the way you battle. Elements can combine to create strong new effects, objects and characters can be blessed to create entirely different effects based on their surroundings, combining abilities can create fantastic (and sometimes even hilarious) opportunities for your party, and so on. You are actively encouraged to try out new things, which is something I rarely see games do now. The diversity of abilities is also a huge plus. There are a bunch of skill paths you can choose from, each having their own unique abilities. You can focus on having a bit of everything, or you can focus on a couple of paths, but whatever you do you will be able to make it work as with many paths you have a lot of capabilities to control the battle, and with less paths your abilities will be much stronger and capable of dealing a lot of damage. Finding a mix-and-match of what works for your team best is part of the fun, you can even change your stats entirely at a certain point so you can change if you feel your current ones aren't working. I think it's no surprise, but the game is damn pretty. Even for a top-down game the level of detail in the world is astounding, and the art style really appeals to me. It never stays the same either, as you explore you will find new areas that have an entirely different look and feel to the last place, usually accomodated by new enemy types as well. I love the different races and how they look, as well as how differently they are represented in the game's society. It's an exceptionally well-made fantasy world that still manages to be believable. Such a great game, if you are even remotely into RPGs I would say give this one a go. It's best played with friends for sure, although playing solo is fine, too.",January 20,"4 people found this review helpful

269,"It's here the game has finally released and oh my god it's better than I expected it to be. This game is the perfect example of an Early Access game that made promises and delivers on ALL of them. The finished product is better in everyway to the buggy alpha build that was given to the Early access players. Positives: - Outstanding voice acting that fits the narrative and theme. - Complex yet simple combat with barely any bugs (Haven't seen any yet) - A brilliant soundtrack that fits in all the situations so far to keep the player immersed. - Game Master mode to create your own story and have your friends play as you are the narrator/creator - Goregous scenery and models, the textures are rich in color and details. - The tweaked skills feel more polished (so far) - You feel the love the devs put into it in every little nook and cranny of the game. - The thrill and suspense of a board game on pc (Elements of course) - Interesting characters with unique origins - Dialogue options in common conversation really do make a difference on how the npcs/world sees you as a character. Cons - So far none I will come across something at some point that rubs me the wrong way but so far it's been such a smooth and amazing expierence that I HIGHLY recommend people to buy. I'm stingy when it comes to money and games since most don't warrant the price that they are being sold for... but this game... It's worth every penny, hell if it was $60 I would drop that in a heart beat easily Game of the year material. Theres just so... much.","September 10, 2017","4 people found this review helpful

270,"OK so I had a friend recommend me this game because he thought it was amazing soooo I normally think anything he thinks is amazing, but I had to try this game for myself after seeing the trailers and gameplay. I'm about 38 hours in and oh my god im so happy i purchased it. There is so much gameplay, quests, goofs, amazingness, etc. It truely makes me want to do every single quest and I get sad if I miss anything. The companions are great I personally have hydro mage, rouge awesomeness elf, and handsome hunter. I also want to completere their own stories because its just so interesting to experience. The fact that most people hate me cause I'm a lizard is cool because the story rotates on what race you are as well. I might even make a second character just to see the reactions and how playing with different companions play out. ANYWAYS game is worth the 45 dollars I paid and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys roleplay. *spoiler* the game punishes you for wanting to bang anyone that gives you the option to bang :( but yay exp lol","September 19, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

275,"This is one of those games I wasn’t really hyped for or interested in for a long time despite it haunting my wishlist for a while. At first it looked like a Diablo clone set in Divinity’s universe which would have been enough for me. Instead, it became more of an older school Baldur’s Gate/Icewind Dale type game with a bit of an XCOM flair to it. There’s many comparisons to be made but funnily enough, the game evokes the feeling of Morrowind and its general open endedness. It is a pleasant surprise. Y’see, in Morrowind, you could literally kill anyone. Even the self-proclaimed living god Vivec. You’d be met with a type of error message telling you to reload or “continue in the doomed world you have created”. However DOS2 here actually doesn’t care who you kill, because progress can be found on journals, diaries, or keys on anyone’s body. Character creation is a fun process. Not a lot on the physical customization because you mostly just play through a tiny avatar through most of the game, but the nuances come in the skillsets and “Origin” characters. You can customize your own but the game comes with about five of their own, and mercifully you can customize their actual class so you can change the Enchantress’s build to suit your personal playstyle (mine being rogue/assassin like people) regardless of how she usually starts as a default NPC. Choosing one of them may be to your benefit as they get extra dialogues and experiences. I chose Lohse, an entertainer/bard type girl who once met a dwarf she was familiar with and despite the grim surroundings, had a bit of a musical duet together for about fifteen seconds and it was quite a sight to see. You’d miss such an interaction if you went just for a personal custom character. The game begins on a prison ship, and Act 1 is placed on the prison island altogether. I didn’t like the idea of being shackled for a while but the game does a great job of giving you plenty to do in what is essentially the game’s over extended tutorial. The amount of freedom I was able to acquire was staggering, even in the confines of the ship itself which is only the first twenty minutes of the game or so. In it, I could bash down doors, find a secret key for some extra loot, and even backtracked to murder a guard that was rude to me earlier, after♥♥♥♥♥♥had hit the fan. It was awesome, and in that moment the game took me. There’s a guy named “Griff”, the inmate who essentially ‘controls’ the other inmates, even going so far as protection rackets and food supplies (he runs the kitchen). There was a chestpiece called “Griff’s Shirt” on the ground, and he’s flanked by another vendor who occasionally patrols away. On a hunch, I decided to sneak behind him when that happened and steal his shirt. It worked! The item’s blurb says “It was Griff’s. Now it’s yours.” Then I saw the patrolling vendor run over yelling “Thief! There’s a criminal about!” I just ran off, not wanting to test the game’s impressive AI to see if it could find me as the thief if I lingered in the area too long. I returned later, wearing his shirt and nobody was the wiser (which may in itself be a weaker point in the AI). There will be some spoilers for Act 1, though my actions are hardly the only ones you can take. To continue on the same line of how insane this game is with options, with the help of one of my online friends… They led me to getting my collar removed, to which I was thrown into a dungeon for that. I don’t know how non-thieves get out of that but I was able to lockpick my way out, retrieve my gear, find a waypoint which allowed the transport of my teammates into the dungeon itself and we… proceeded to absolutely demolish the guards from the inside out. We basically cleared the island. It was great. There are so many nuances to the game that aren’t outwardly apparent. You may notice as you traverse the landscape that your characters will get a variety of buffs like “wet” and “warm” which might turn to your detriment in combat when enemies cast spells to take advantage of those. The game is littered with oil spills, blood splatters, firey explosions and puddles. Each one can be affected by a spell type. One time, I had my mage set some enemies on fire but when it turned out to be to my detriment (my melee characters couldn’t reach some of the enemies), I had her cast “rain” which didn’t just put the fires out, but actually creates a smoke screen which limited the enemies’ vision. So many enemies use a spell to summon a slick of oil then promptly set it on fire. They’re not idiots. Combat in this game does an excellent job of making sure you’re both aware of your surroundings, and then actually capitalizing on it. There’s more to it the nuances than your combat. I was speaking to a lizard-raced bodyguard in a cave who was very standoffish to my own character. On another hunch based on some of this guy’s dialog, I switched to a different party member and spoke with him again. I switched to Ifan, an ex-soldier. Being a soldier himself, the lizard-man actually respected Ifan more and had more dialog to give and even had an extra discount on the few wares he sold. Most of my RPG life is spent in the perspective of my own, and it is a bit refreshing to see that exploring other personalities is typically rewarded here. As I said, I’ve only played through most of Act 1 so I do not have the full picture as far as the game will give me, but I am excited to find out, and more excited to the fact that there isn’t much I can get overtly wrong here. If I had a complaint, it’d be the same complaint I have in many open world RPG’s. At a certain point my quest log gets bogged down by errands and scavenger hunts and it’s hard to tell which ones will be worth my time and what wouldn’t be. It’s also the one thing I feel I can actually get wrong - after having most of Act 1 down I still find myself with more than a few side quests, like finding a woman’s missing child and I’m not sure if I’ll be missing out on any potential rewards if I just give up and move on in the story. It’s a minor point to be sure considering the freedom the game is able to give you. There’s so many other side stories I could give. Like how my multiplayer friend had the only pet pal perk, spoke to some dogs and then I ran back towards them and they all went hostile. Or how my dwarf teammate met up with an old friend and had a chuckle. Or what the pet pal perk even does, talking to dogs is just pure gold. Many other stories to be had and I can’t wait to hear others.","September 26, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

292,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW :Early access Alpha review. At the time of writing only the first chapter is available: Original Sin 2 improves upon every element of the first installment. There are more disciplines (and therefore more powers and skills). The environment reacts to elemental powers in more complex and interesting ways, leading to more tactical options. The new art style is a great improvement for the character models (personal opinion possibly). The combat is still solid, and the writing is still engaging. All in all, if you enjoyed the first iteration of Original Sin, then I imagine you'll love this one too. My only gripe is that local multiplayer has been removed, and online is the only option if you want to play with friends. While this may not be a massive issue for some people, I played through the first version using couch co op with my wife, and I'd have liked to do the same again with this one, however it is not possible. I'm not sure whether it's a planned feature for the full release or not, so maybe it'll be added in the future. All in all, fully recommended.","May 16, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

The fight mechanics also depend heavily on the environment: element attacks have unique interactions with other elemental surfaces, height and positioning are hugely important in damage calculations, etc. You can choose any subset of characters you want, either custom or prebuilt (with backstory to discover as you play the game). I can't wait to play through the game again with a new set of characters and experience things in a different way, with new dialogue options, skills, builds, and alliances. I have more than 80 hours and haven't even beaten the game yet on the easiest difficulty; this game is 100% worth the money.","November 22, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

297,"I love Larian Studios so much! The first Orginal sin game was great and they produced another winner here. Larian not only managed to prevent their game from entering early access hell for all of eternity, but they also managed to deliver on all of their kickstarter promises and more (with the exception of translations for some languages being delayed a week). Excellent and noteworthy features: -Deep dialogue system with meaningful choices and consequences -Beautiful orchestral soundtrack -Undead feature implemented well into character customization -Split screen and online multiplayer/ co-op -Full controller support -Game Master mode for what is essentially in-engine D&D -80,000 lines of dialogue, fully voiced The list goes on.

Oh, you're a lucky duck and have friends? You can play with them, too. You're a DM and want to play this with your pals? Go right the ♥♥♥♥ on and create yourself a nice little campaign to play, or to share with other players. This is one of the best RPG games I've played.

302,"So far the game is really fun, very similar to the first but also different enough to not feel like you're playing the same game. Unlike the fisrt game there there are no voice actors, so there is quite a lot of text to read. I also miss being able to teleport everywhere with the pyramids. Aside from that, I enjoy this game very much. Edit: Now that the game has been released from early access there is full voice acting and 4 pyramids to find throughout the world. Same as my earlier comments, if you played the first game and liked it, this game has all of that plus even more.","June 27, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

Having co-op is a blessing, and although I have not used the feature (yet), the GM mode to facilitate custom D&D style campaigns that can be influenced and created personally is impressive. (Also appreciate the amazing community, I have found numerous people to play with, with each new fresh start to the game and different build choices offering a new combat experience). This game easily competes with AAA titles and developers by offering content the community wants without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ wring-the-consumers-for-all-they're-worth game model, as well as allowing mod support from day one.

310,"Product received for free The realm of Rivellon feels vibrant and alive. At times sunny and cheerful, with delightfully lighthearted moments, but also deeply disturbing and dark, unafraid of having players face things that can only be described as nightmare fuel. One minute you are talking to a happy bear about honey and the next you are running for your life from a giant spider that wants to feed you to its babies. The balance between those two, the light and the dark, is spot on. The storylines are wonderful and interesting, with tons of variety. Side quests don’t feel like filler content which is a big plus for a game as large and full of things to do as Divinity: Original Sin 2 is. It's one of the best looking isometric RPG’s ever made. Each of the games four major areas are exquisitely detailed and beautiful in their own unique way. Characters have subtle animations and visual flourishes that really make them stand out. The colour pallet is vibrant, gorgeous and bright with striking blue, green, red and yellow colours. The game does makes sure to contrast that with deep blacks, subtle grays and dark reds when fighting in the darker, more evil infested areas. Everything is visually interesting. The soundtrack is wonderful. Joyous and fun one moment, tense and foreboding the next. None of the music feels repetitive or overstays its welcome. The sinister transition music that rings out when you enter truly dangerous areas still makes a shiver run up my spine every time I hear it. The fact that every line of dialogue in the game is voice acted is impressive and almost always of impeccable quality. It really helps sells the games more emotional moments. The turn based combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2 is all about interconnected systems. Fire ignites poison clouds or oil slicks. Rain puts out fire while ice can trip up enemies and allies alike. Necromancy can raise the dead or curse the living but can be countered by healing magic. Everything has a counterpoint of some type and a well coordinated exchange can take advantage of any number of systems to powerful effect. Unlike D&D games where your characters live or die by a lucky or unlucky roll of the dice, Divinity: Original Sin 2 does not make players worship at the alter of the RNG (random number generation) gods quite so much. The longer you play the more complex the combat interactions. By the time you reach the mid to late game the list of abilities and spells at your disposal is vast. Even though each character chooses a class at the beginning of the game you can place points into whatever skill trees and abilities you want. The game encourages experimentation and since you can respec as much as you want once you leave the games first area there is nothing to stop you from making a character that is exactly what you want it to be. The early game leans a bit too heavily on basic elemental exchanges like fire and ice, but eventually you’ll spend just as much time raising the dead, summoning demons, blinding your foes or charming people as you will tossing fireballs and ice shards. Because you have so many options when it comes to combat a lot of players have found ways to cheese the system. Some interactions were things the developers intended, but others are clearly breaking the game in ways they never considered. Patches post launch have addressed some of these issues, such as inflicting bleeding damage on an enemy and then transforming them into a chicken that runs itself to death. Or infinite damage loops that result from the interplay between buffs and attacks. That said the game encourages players to find innovative ways to tackle major obstacles. My personal favorite tactic it using teleport to push a tough enemy into the path of another powerful NPC and watch them tear each other to pieces. Even with the ability to cheese the system at times and the plethora of options at your disposal, playing Divinity: Original Sin 2 on anything above Explorer difficulty can be really, really tough. Especially your first 10 hours with the game as you learn the intricacies of its many systems and options. The AI is smart and deadly and will throw every trick in the book at you. I restarted my campaign a half dozen times and invested almost 20 hours before I found a party composition and set of builds I felt complemented the way I wanted to play the game. The game features a robust crafting system. Dozens of spells, potions, meals, enchantments and items can be crafted. You can learn recipes from books or experiment on your own to learn new ones. The one area where crafting falls short is weapons and armour. Freedom and experimentation is at the very heart of what makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing. It applies not only to combat but how you tackle the games many quests and challenges. Almost everything has multiple avenues of approach and a myriad of solutions. The games main story quests give you a direction to aim yourself at but how you get there is completely up to you. However this is also where Divinity: Original Sin 2‘s biggest problem rears its head. The game is terrible at informing you if you are on the right track in completing certain quest lines and is often vague, to the point of maddening frustration, when it comes to giving you any sort of hint when it comes to what you should do next. On the one hand it is nice that the game does not hold your hand as if you were a child who never played an RPG before, but on the other it would be nice to know why a quest that seems to be over isn’t. Sometimes you are not sure if you just missed something or if the quest line is just bugged because you approached it in a way the developers never expected or tested for. This issue becomes more apparent the further along you get in the game. Act 1 is relatively aggravation free when it comes following quest lines or encountering bugs. But by the end of Act 2 you’ll likely pull your hair out over at least a few quests or nonsensical bugs. The game has been out a month now and I’m still locked out of a handful of quest the developers have acknowledged are broken because of the way I triggered them. I was able to get past the major bugs that were in my way but a bunch still remain. The very thing that makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing is the same thing that has caused issues with progressing further down quest lines or receiving rewards. It’s by no means a game breaker and given the immense size of Divinity: Original Sin 2 and the sheer scope of what you can choose to do its amazing the game does not have more issues. The quest log definitely needs an overhaul and there are several major bugs that still need addressing but Larian Studios has already dropped a few hotfixes and one very large patch to address players concerns. Given the wonderful support Divinity: Original Sin 1 received I have no doubt that Divinity: Original Sin 2‘s remaining blemishes will be ironed out before too long.","October 16, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

But most importantly this is one of the only games i have ver played where I fell like you actually have the freedom to play as you please. There are a ton of ways to apporach almost every problem, and the game really lets you play around and get creative with it's unique mechanics. This game is the opposite of handholdy so when you use the mechanics to figure out a unique solution to a problem it is incredibly satisfying as nothing tells you to do certain things in certain ways.

329,"Upfront, I'll say this game does have some fun gameplay at times. However a litany of problems make me give this a negative review. - Dumbfoundingly inconsisent difficulty. Battles range from entertainingly fun to stupendously, insultingly difficult. Seriously, you should never have to go into a battle knowing EXACTLY what is going to happen in order to have a chance of surviving (not winning, just surviving). And the only reason you know what's about to happen is because you've tried it half a dozen times and failed each time. - Weak story compared to D:OS, and heavy use of sad, tired and predictable tropes. Half the time it wasn't even clear what we were trying to accomplish, and who/what we were fighting against or for. And when major plot points did occur, most of the time our response was ""Really? We're doing this again? Sigh..."" - For a game that encourages you to forge your own way, it punishes you for not following some pre-assumed path through the world. Heaven help you if you choose a different direction - enemies do not scale with level, and gear that would help you manage is prohibitively expensive. So if you head west when the game expects you to head east, you'll struggle. - Battles that break the game's own pre-established rules. Examples: repeat casting of abilities which have multi-round cooldowns, and stacking identical status ailments. Case in point: The Sallow Man's Airborne Plague, which bypasses all armour (physical and magical), stacks with itself (I was at -15 Con at one point because of three repeat casts) and can be cast EVERY ROUND. - Inconsistent lore/world impacts: you can kill someone and consume their soul, only for them to show up again later, apparently none the worse for wear. (Yay, that achieved a lot...). - Multiplayer feels like two single player games occurring simultanously, with some quests not progressing or closing because the wrong player spoke to the quest giver. To add to that, if the speaker doesn't have the required item for a fetch quest, too bad - having it in the party isn't enough (but the game doesn't let you know that, does it? That would be too much to ask...) - Quest system is broken. Somewhat repaired with a patch, but if you'd progressed past a certain point, the damage was done. The Tarquin side-quest was just a balls-up. - My partner, who was using a controller (I use keyboard/mouse), had endless difficulty with target selection and interactions with the environment. Certain skills just wouldn't work (no reason was given - you just can't select this character because we say so). The controller interface also made line-of-sight hard to gauge, so several times critical actions were lost because of some unseen obstacle. - Multi-stage boss battles: stop, just stop with this tired, over-used and just irritating chiche. This has been done so many times it's just not interesting, exciting or surprising. - Some puzzles have an exact solution required, but the game gives you absolutely no guidance or hints. Another case in point: the Cursed Revenants in the Lizard Embassy. We gave up trying to solve that and just left them there. We got around them enough to finish the quest, but they'll be sitting there in the ruins till Judement Day. More on the battle difficulty: if you're at the correct character level for a given encounter (ie a L5 party against L5 opponents) I don't think it's unreasonable that your party members are able to survive the opening salvo. I GM a Pathfinder group and so understand that some encounters are meant to be more challenging that others, depending on their importance in the plot progression. However, given that in 95% of encounters one or more of the opponents invariably go first, the number of times one (or more) of our party members were one-shot killed or disabled before they've had a chance to act is kinda ludicrous. This ties back into my previous point where you have to know exactly what is about to happen in order to have a chance of getting through the battle (which I consider meta-gaming in a cRPG). Sure, give the enemies superior starting positions and outnumber the party, but don't compount that by making every mook immediately superior to the whole party. For a game that we've spent over 100 hours on, this has left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I can't say I've enjoyed it. We've given up trying to win the final battle, and to be honest I couldn't care less about how it ends. There were occasional moments of fun, but the negatives outweigh them.","October 10, 2017","39 people found this review helpful

330,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Just read the article on PC Gamer interviewing Sven. So far I think the game is great. In response to that article I love having almost nothing at the beginning and having to scavenge. The loot system is really rewarding right now and I feel every piece of armour or weapon i find is making a difference in fights on Classic mode. Magic and Phsyical armour is great too, it's satisfying to break through armour and seeing the health bar drop like in bayonetta. Only thing I wish which I loved in Pillars of Eternity was the ability to click on the map and have the camera go directly to that spot. Would save a lot of pointless time in moving the map trying to figure out where it is I want to go. Other than that this game pulled me right in.","September 28, 2016",5 people found this review helpful

337,"Oh, its such wonderfull game. Game features classless system, but you can of course play some prebuild classes or Origin characters. Origins characters are ingame companions who disappears after you choose them as they main. Upon meeting companions after some time playing, you can choose their skillset... which vastly improves replaybility... EA featurs Act One and Prologue and Prologue is awesome... Act One is wonderfull as well, with numerous quest and one annoying cat. I really like artwork of this game, it's well done.","August 25, 2017",5 people found this review helpful

343,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW DOS2 is a gorgeous isometric game, using tactical turn based combat with a lot of depth, 4-player coop, mod support, full voice acting, Dungeon Master mode (excellent for a proper ""tabletop"" experience) and a world rich in lore to boot. Not only that, but devs that love their product, respect their playerbase and frequently read the forums. I played around 40 hours (on GOG) of Early Access and it was only an incomplete Act 1 (the full game will have 3 acts), so I am expecting around 80-100 hours of gameplay, not counting coop, reruns, different difficulty settings etc -- worth the money if you ask me. Yet, the biggest reason I am recommending this game is that this is a proper roleplaying experience. This game feels like you sit on a table with some friends, some coffee/soda and pizza, D&D rulebooks and get transported to a world of your own making. The last game that made me willing to experience everything was Fallout NV, but I didn't care that much about the Courier's personality: I cared about exploring the world itself. In this game I genuinely feel compelled to roleplay different classes/races. TL;DR? I recommend this to anyone that is a fan of fantasy RPGs. If you are also a fan of turn-based combat, this is a no-brainer.","September 1, 2017",5 people found this review helpful
344,"44 hours into the game, and we are just finishing act 1.. Few games gave me the same experience I'm having now with DOS2, and I don't mean the artistic, gameplay or story aspects of the game here, I'm talking about a personal feeling of satisfaction that as ""Gamers"" we are lucky to have a studio like Larian to develop such a marvel for us with such attention to details and passion for perfection, that you know from the start of the game you're going into a very special adventure.. The only game I remember that was able to deliver this personal experience and show the same level of love and dedication from its developer was the Witcher 3. The Story (so far), the music, the voice acting, the graphics, and the world details, are all perfect. The 6 origin characters, are very interesting to choose from and play as, each has her/his unique persona, story and quests. Gameplay mechanics are hard but satisfying, it's a turned based tactical strategy with action points to spend each turn (xcom style), with a big number of varied abilities, skills and talents to learn, build, use and combo. Quest tracking and inagme journal can be a bit confusing though, and might force you to miss some details on some quests, I don't consider that as a bad thing in principle, as it encourages you to keep checking the journal regularly, to find out and explore or even miss things on your own, but I would like to see some improvements on it in future patches. The camera is inconvenient sometimes, it can be hard to spot enemies on higher grounds and the ones who are blocked or standing behind other characters. It's hard to justify why some of the AOE skills are still affected by the miss chance, since most of them are still resisted by magical and physical armor anyway. Now, one of the best parts about playing DOS2 for me is the co-op mode, that's why i mentioned “We” at the beginning, I was lucky enough to have a friend who was interested in the game, and agreed to start the story with me, and since then we are having a blast, and enjoying the game together. Playing in co-op provides you with a totally different experience, which adds to an already amazing game, I honestly think everyone should give it a try.. I mean: discussing the choices we have been offered in some conversation with a random rat, that we were able to speak to using one of our characters talent.. Asking my friend to use one of his character's flying skills to reach places my characters can't.. My friend asking me to buy him a skill book he found interesting, since I've invested some points in the barter ability which improve my trading skill, therefor I can buy items for cheaper prices than him.. Doing silly stuff that cause us to lose the fight like miss-clicking the wrong area, or healing my friend's rogue main character without noticing that she has the “Decay” debuff which damages her instead, laughing at our mistakes and then reload.. Those are some of the things that make co-op a great feature in the game, and all you need to enjoy it, is the in-game text chat, obviously you can use any type of communication, but i personally find the text chat better for maintaining immersion. There are too many great games out there, but few of them can standout to be a masterpiece, DOS2 has its rare flaws sometimes but as a whole, it does ascend to its well deserved place as one of the best games of this generation, and this is one man's opinion.","October 4, 2017",5 people found this review helpful

351,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Don't listen to the people giving negative reviews based on their limited understanding of the game mechanics and frustration at not being able to progress -- this game will suck you in and entertain you for hours if you let loose and accept the fluid nature of it all and just let yourself explore the beautiful world. Make no mistake, the game will never hold your hand and tell you everything will be alright. But at the same time, the developers knew people would push the bounds of idiocy, so there are myriad ways to progress in the story and to get from point A to point B, even if you happened to accidentally get in a fight with that guy who seemed really important and he's dead on the ground. A few things have been broken or unenjoyable throughout the alpha, but the developers have been very receptive to constructive feedback from the community and most gripes that I've personally had have been addressed and it truly seems that the developers only want to put forward the best game that they can. It is refreshing to see the level of dedication and excitement for their work come through in the game and I personally cannot wait for release day.","September 5, 2017",5 people found this review helpful

354,"Product received for free TL:DR Original Sin II is very good. If you want a game with really fun combat and some good exploration, you've got one right here. The game maintains a higher overall standard of quality than its predecessor, but combat has some big issues and the later two areas are fairly weak. I found it to be good, but I was disappointed at the lack of improvement over a lot of areas where the first game could use some. ★★★★☆ Divinity: Original Sin II is an isometric RPG where you play as a Sourcerer, a person capable of wielding the mighty power of Source. You get to pick your character and choose a preset class or edit one, and choose an origin or just create a custom character altogether. Origin characters have actual personal stories and motivations in the world besides the beginning of the main plot. My character seemed a bit meh at first (Sebille, an elf looking for the lizard who enslaved her so she could kill him) but it got to an interesting twist. Other characters I picked on my party ended up being more interesting, but you don't get direct access to their conversations. The game isn't really big on choices and consequences, so I found these things mostly side fluff. The main plot begins with your character and all origin characters, as well as the starting cutscene narrator, being sent to a prison-island (the rather ironically named Fort Joy) to get treated of their Source condition. It's totally fine to be able to shoot fireballs since that's not Sourcery, but using that to remove debuffs or get yourself an extra turn gets you imprisoned because it attracts Voidwoken, creatures which only appear near manifestations of Source. There's quite a lot of ways to escape Fort Joy, which makes it feel a bit strange how there are still so many people inside. There's also the fact there are weapon and skill trader prisoners, which makes me feel the setting wasn't very well thought out. To be honest, since I played the first game at launch, I wasn't expecting a terrific story/setting from this one. But for all the new writers they hired, it feels like there's not a huge improvement. The story didn't really grab me, even though it was better than the last game's ""There's this big dragon you have to defeat."" It did the job for giving you an extra reason to explore the world, but I didn't find it anything groundbreaking. After 56 hours I got the ending cutscene showing the consequences of my actions throughout the game ala Fallout, and I found I didn't remember half the people the cutscene was talking about at first (one or two I chuckled while hearing what they did after the ending, since I actually killed them in the game). Anyway, enough with story crap, since the Original Sin games are more about exploring and using massive cheese to kill things or reach places which are difficult to reach. Exploration is fun, and there's a lot of interesting things to find in the four areas of the game, but the latter two (also, fortunately, the shortest, occupying roughly 15 of my 56 hours) are where the game starts to fall off in quality. The final area seemed to lack polish on a basic level, even: I found a corpse named UNKNOWN and a portrait with the name ""Painting of a Fan - Placeholder"". The first two areas tend to be more fun, but the thing is they felt fairly railroaded as for where to go. Even though you can sometimes go to places you have no business being in by use of teleportation skills, it's often very hard to fight enemies which are even only one level above you. This makes it so you have to almost take a specific path through the game in order not to find massive difficulty spikes. The second area also feels a bit themepark-y, with some clear sub-area separation by a sort of theme (desert, cemetery, etc.). Exploring will get you some really creative quests, ranging from helping animals find love to more serious matters like stopping people from getting killed. The quest log doesn't often give you an ultra-clear indication on what to do, so it's fun to experiment a bit (though sometimes what you have to do to progress is fairly weird to think of, especially towards the endgame). Your characters will often find hidden switches and buried chests with treasure, too. The items are mostly randomized and you won't stay with them for long since they become obsolete at level up, but it's still fun to find good loot. Original Sin II's strongest point, like its predecessor, is, of course, the combat. Unfortunately, they ♥♥♥♥ed up some things here. First, the level difference is the most important stat in combat unless you intend to do ungodly cheese like unloading boxes of Deathfog on someone (instantly killing any non-undead) or teleporting them to a high-level NPC, and this is worse at certain levels where HP and damage numbers just get an arbitrary 50% boost. Then you have the fact that everything has been very much simplified (attributes and skills pretty much only giving +5% bonuses to a stat now, and there being a fixed AP for all characters unless hasted, which means you pretty much level your damage stat in braindead mode until you need some initiative or skill slots). You also have a new armor system made to make combat not be a disable-fest immediately, but having it take three turns of whittling down a secondary HP bar so you can start a cancerous disable-fest. Finally, initiative (the stat which determines how early your turn is in the whole combat round) is broken and non-moddable unlike the rest of these problems. It's basically a forced player-enemy-player round order which makes initiative a lot less meaningful. With the (massive) problems combat has out of the way, the big upside to it is that it's still ridiculous fun. The addition of two new skill types (Polymorph and Summoning) increased the variety in builds by a lot. Unfortunately you can't respec on the first act, but this helps figure out a party plan for the rest of the game, where you can do it with no cost. I ended up going with a sub-optimal party composition (with three massive physical damage dealers and only one magician, which doesn't often work well because of the armor system, where there is a separate value for physical damage/disable blocking and magical), but it got me through the game with no major difficulty (though I must stress that since I didn't find my level's area at a certain point in the game, I started squeezing every bit of XP from quests I had left, leaving me overleveled by 1-2 levels for 40% of the game, which made it probably a lot easier). Each skill type has quite a lot of different spells, enabling your creativity to get out of particularly hard fights. While physical damage is mostly clean for the environment, magical will make your battleground an entertaining chaos of fire, poison and electrified water, to name a few (mostly fire though), and I don't think I'll forget a certain fight on an oil rig (I imagine my graphics card won't either, as it's likely scarred from having to render so much goddamn fire!) This doesn't mean physical damage is less fun, as both the Scoundrel and Warfare trees give some decent mobility for melee fighters to get into position and backstab or smash foes to the ground, and rangers are made more fun in this game with the addition of high ground, making positioning even more important, and fights more interesting in general. The summoning skill tree is mostly about strengthening your summons, the main one being the Incarnate, whose abilities change depending on the surface it's cast on (the Incarnate gets a powerful upgrade ONLY at max summoning, which I found fairly dumb). It's really amazing that with all its problems, Original Sin II's combat is still so goddamn fun. In the end, it's more Original Sin: the story's better, and exploring and fighting still rewards creativity. I was disappointed that they didn't improve that much, but I still had good fun with the game.","October 12, 2017",5 people found this review helpful

356,"[Spoiler-Free Review] Foreword: The game is not reccomended for a few major reasons: 1. It lacks serious mechanical polish; if you played the first game, expect to be disappointed by many of the mechanics. 2. The game is seriously bugged, the majority of quests are very likely to break and become uncompletable-- Including the entire endgame sequence. 3. Acts 3, 4, and the endgame lack the content and polish of the first two acts, and were clearly rushed out the door. Pros (Reasons to Purchase) +Combat is turn-based, tactical fun +Game has very acceptable voice acting, no particularly bad examples stand out +Art direction and visual design is top notch +OST, while not as good as D:OS1, is not bad with many fantastic tracks +World is vibrant and full of characters you can interact with +Game allows you a great degree of freedom in exploration and progression +Memory Slot system is much better than D:OS1's School system +Early game is very polished and expansive, lots of content and choice Notables (Things You Might Want To Know_ =The writing is very hit-or-miss, but is excellent compared to AAA RPGs =Combat is very easy to those familiar with cRPGs and played the first game to completion; but is very challenging for those inexperienced with tactical combat or cRPGs. =Potential party members seem very abrasive and offputting early on before their stories develop =As of the time of writing, support for content creators is barebones but growing Cons (Reasons to Think Twice) -Game's Quest Log system is broken, almost every quest in the game can and will break, have wrong entries in the journal, become unresolvable, or just outright disappear -Game's combat is significantly streamlined -The new Armor System was not properly fleshed out, leading to a lot of issues -Several mechanics are redundant, forgotten, or outright removed (Accuracy, Initiative, Attributes, etc) -Itemization, Crafting and the Economy are much worse than the previous game's -Character Building is very boring compared to D:OS1; there isn't nearly as many elements to work with, and lots of choices have been streamlined away -Lategame gets more and more restrictive and unpolished, things become a trainwreck by Act 4 -Devs are on a spree of nerfing/removing/restricting things in the game rather than fixing balance or overhauling anything; does not set a good trend for the game's continued development and community support If you really want to buy it, or liked the first game, just do a bit of research about what changed and the game's current state before you end up in a 4 man coop party 49 hours later unable to complete the game, and half of you end up quitting or refunding before they bother to release the first major patch a month later.","September 25, 2017",8 people found this review helpful

374,"Wow, where do I begin... This game harkens back to a time long past, a time of unforgiving games that don't hold your hand, and offers you pithy clues to make your way through a vast uncompromising land replete with challenging combat, the odd puzzle, and a myriad of ways to deal with a situation rather than selecting an option through a chat box. There were so many instances during my playthrough where I felt like I was breaking quests only to see them to completion in ways that would have involved a reload in others. It's a game that stands on some firm philosophical foundations: questioning the nature of power, the idea of power corrupting or the good that can be done if consolidated. It explores the nature of institutions in a world gone awry, exemplifying the idea that the road to hell is most certainly paved with good intentions. The moral dilemmas are many, and in an almost Witcheresque fashion, the consequences of actions taken often come with a cost. That being said, Larian is able to balance the seriousness of the subject with the humor, sarcasm, and satire that they are known for and given the gravity of the events unfolding, the humor adds an extra dimension to the game. The combat is as challenging as you want it to be. I don't mean in terms of a difficulty slider, I mean in terms of scouring the forums for optimal builds or cheesing for gold to get the best possible equipment. I don't condemn either, I found it rather refreshing that the satisfaction of combat is as customizable as you want it to be depending on how one chooses to engage in a situation. Do you use environmental barrels? Reposition before engaging the situation? Run in and make do? Some of these will work, others will not, but what is interesting is that the solutions to these situations are many and are at the discretion of the player. The companions you can choose all have excellent backgrounds, some more interesting than others, but all of them were noteworthy. What is also interesting about it is that they are not just there for you, like in most RPGs, they have their own ambitions, goals, and desires and often time going at odds with them could cost you a slot on your roster. The quests and the world itself are amazing, especially the latter. It's not perfect, and you can clearly see some additional attention was given to certain areas of the game over others, but the different areas, the choices made, and consequences really strengthen the overall story and your journey from a prisoner in Fort Joy to its aftermath. The quests, in typical Larian fashion, run the gamut. They vary from discovering a serial killer to the occasional rescue to providing an item or eliminating a threat. They are pretty standard fare, but what is interesting is how many different ways you can handle them and the consequences of handling them in the way that you do. There have been bugs with journal entries, and sometimes quests can seem rather baffling, but I didn't really let that upset me. I have no doubt that in the coming months they will be fixed and tightened up. But yeah, to some, and to me at times, it was frustrating. All in all, this was an excellent game. Perhaps that isn't the right word, it was better than excellent. It was not without its faults, but I really got a lot out of it, from the story, to the challenging combat, the voice acting, the perks and quirks of communing with animals, the different ways to tackle each situation and even the soundtrack. It's a tightly knit rich and rewarding game that you savor long after it ends and even into the beginning of the next playthrough. If you like CRPGs, you will most likely really see this as a worthy successor to the Fallout 2 style of CRPGs. People have been comparing it to Baldur's Gate 2, and, in terms of the story, companions, and the epic nature of the experience, you can definitely draw comparisons, but the combat is firmly rooted in the Fallout 2 or Temple of Elemental Evil tradition. So, yeah, Larian does it again, even better than before. I expected a good game, even a great game, but I was not expecting this. It will be penned into the great book of RPG goodness that it deserves. Larian firmly deserves every bit of success they get from this title. They have stolen the divinity from the former greats and it is perhaps only contested for the crown, in my opinion, by CDPR. Obsidian is also up there, but POE, even in all of its greatness, failed to evoke the same feelings that I had for this. It really filled the void left for me by the Witcher 3, and for those of you that know what I'm talking about and perhaps for those of you reading these reviews to see if it's a worthwhile purchase...it is. Good luck in your future endeavors Larian, I, for one, will be there to continue to back your projects henceforth, bien fait.","September 23, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

377,"This game is an awesome rpg co-op experience with your friends. It's even better than expected. I'd definitely recommend hard difficulty for experienced tactical players. On the other hand, the story pulls you in. There are a lot of side quests, puzzles, and mysteries as well. At the beginning were the predefined characters not that interesting to me, but with time they grew to my heart. And seriously, every single NPC dubbed? With branching conversations? That's every rpg player's dream come true. So be prepared to read a lot too. Or not, that's up to you. Combat? Feels very fluent and very similar to a combat from the first game. But now some skills can be better combined and create a potential for your cunning. For example: with Hydrosophist and Necromancer you can make Raining Blood - which creates blood surfaces, sets bleeding on enemies and douses fire surfaces - and those blood surfaces you can further electrify or freeze, or simply walk on it with blood sucker for some healing. Music? Masterpiece by Borislav Slavov. TL;DR: Like fantasy RPG and tactics? Get your best friends/partners and get it right now!","November 26, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

I like all of the customisation for your build and how much backstory everything can have. I also like how you can rush through everything or you can take it slow and just enjoy all the backstory, music, and just interesting gameplay.

380,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW It took me 21 hours to finish the Early Access version of the game and even then I skipped stuff. In the same spirit of games like Baldur's Gate, this game stands out as one of the best RPG's I've played since Witcher 3. I'd easily rank this one right behind Witcher 3 as one of the two best RPG's I've played. Good: Story with immersive choices, influenced by character, class and background choices ontop of gameplay choices. Rich world with a huge amount of things to do. Meaningful choices, where perks, traits and so on actually have an impact on how you play and even how the story goes. Very high replayability, thanks to all the above. Very pretty to look at and runs excellently. Bad: Very slow pace, but it's due to the fact that there is so much to do, so much to take in and consider as you progress. Combat can take a long time. Boss fights especially can take a very long time. Even on the supposed Explorer difficulty mode, I had characters die horribly in combat. I feel that even though this difficulty is meant to be very easy, that it isn't and is still a bit of a challenge. So I can't imagine what the normal difficulty is like. Some minor spelling errors, but this is EA version so those might be corrected in the full version. : Combat can be difficult. You may often need to reload to try a different approach to a fight or to avoid it entirely until you're better prepared. You may progress too quickly into new areas of the game. There is a TON of dialogue, so if you're the type of person who is impatient and doesn't like reading you might struggle with this game as it's important to read the dialogue. The deep combat system that involves combining different conditions, applying them correctly, countering them and so on takes a bit of learning but can also make fights drag on. I've liked it, especially when I've accidentally combined Elements with a great effect, but I see that it could also be frustrating.","September 12, 2017",3 people found this review helpful
381,"20 Hour Review 20 hours into Divinity: Original Sin 2 and I feel like I haven't even finished 1% of the game yet! I will update this review down the road! So far... Larian has outdone themselves again! -Engrossing storytelling, dialogue and voice acting -Bottomlessly diverse combat systems -A sprawling and vibrant world that beckons for exploration -The complete absence of ""Go here, Go there"" style questing -Choice and consequence system like no other -Nearly absolute freedom to choose your character (s) fate -Everything you ever hoped for in an RPG I have to say I'm not a fan of turn-based combat games and it was almost what turned me off from trying the first Divinity: Original Sin... but if that is your one bugaboo with this game I would highly recommend giving it a chance, the combat is just so incredible!

The storytelling is a bit cliche, nothing surprising. However, the battles are quite challenging, interesting and varied and there is a LOT of content to keep you entertained for dozens of hours. Companions are great and add some great depth into the game. I hope this is a standard kept on RPGs now and with a better writting we will see better and better games.

384,"8.5/10 A friend of mine told me about this game and said that I should check it out cause I would probably like it. I didn't check for a week but after some more time I took a look. 10 minutes after first checking out the game I bought it and here I am, almost 100 hours in the game. The game is huge, we played the first act for 20+ hours, and there are 4 acts! The gameplay is very interactive and feels great, you can, for example, create a puddle of acid and set it ablaze! EVERYTHING is voice acted and the graphics look beautiful. Also the combat system is great for players that like tactical games. Your positioning and skill usage matter a lot, 1 wrong move might cause the end of you. There's also a ton of replay value due to all the different classes, origin stories and decisions that you make. On top of that there's the Game Master mode where you can create your own campaign or play the ones from others aswell as the workshop which already has a ton of stuff on it. The only 2 things that I dislike so far is the fact that a few quests have a tendency to bug out making you unable to complete the quest. Also the mages in this game are kinda underwhelming. Physical characters are much more potent. Im hoping they'll take a look into that. All in all a great game and possibly one of the best rpgs ive played so far. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to play rpgs and being able to play this game for months to come.","September 30, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

390,"Just a disclaimer, this is my first time playing this type of game. I have never been interested in them, but with all the praise this game has been receiving, I figured I would buy it to try it out. I have been thoroughly impressed with the quality and quantity of the game thus far, especially for the cheaper price tag. The level of complexity with the combat system and crafting is unmatched, I feel like I discover new ways to play the game every few minutes. It can be a difficult game, though that makes it so satisfying when you win a battle. The game doesn't hold your hand, and my friend started out feeling overwhelmed by what we could or couldn't do. The tactical decision making sort of reminds me of Dragon Age: Origins, though more in-depth by far. Performance is pretty good, there isn't SLI support, though you probably won't need it. The game dropped frames significantly once when surrounded by fire, smoke, gas, and electricity in a high foliage area. I fully recommend this game if you're even remotely on the fence about it, and I look forward to spending hundreds of hours mastering different classes.

393,"I love the game and could go into a lot of detail about why, but you've probably heard it all before. Just read a review or two. It's getting very good reviews. Suffice to say that it's one of the only RPGs that tick all the boxes for me. I'm a story guy, and it has excellent writing, voice acting, and role-playing. But what really sets this game apart for me is how diverse and engaging the gameplay is. It has an Ultima-like world model sandbox quality to it, and the combat (which is boring to me in about 90% of all RPGs) is consistently excellent. The reason I'm writing this, though, is because of the many ""it's buggy and crashes all the time"" reports. I can't say for sure that it's *not* crashing for those folks, because why would they lie? All I can tell you is that I have played for over 50 hours and have not had a single crash. Not one. Whatever is causing problems for some, it's not ubiqutious and it shouldn't stop you from trying the game.

396,"Wow, where do I begin... This game harkens back to a time long past, a time of unforgiving games that don't hold your hand, and offers you pithy clues to make your way through a vast uncompromising land replete with challenging combat, the odd puzzle, and a myriad of ways to deal with a situation rather than selecting an option through a chat box. There were so many instances during my playthrough where I felt like I was breaking quests only to see them to completion in ways that would have involved a reload in others. It's a game that stands on some firm philosophical foundations: questioning the nature of power, the idea of power corrupting or the good that can be done if consolidated. It explores the nature of institutions in a world gone awry, exemplifying the idea that the road to hell is most certainly paved with good intentions. The moral dilemmas are many, and in an almost Witcheresque fashion, the consequences of actions taken often come with a cost. That being said, Larian is able to balance the seriousness of the subject with the humor, sarcasm, and satire that they are known for and given the gravity of the events unfolding, the humor adds an extra dimension to the game. The combat is as challenging as you want it to be. I don't mean in terms of a difficulty slider, I mean in terms of scouring the forums for optimal builds or cheesing for gold to get the best possible equipment. I don't condemn either, I found it rather refreshing that the satisfaction of combat is as customizable as you want it to be depending on how one chooses to engage in a situation.

My wife and I are always in the market for a good couch-coop game, and this one is spectacular. My only complaint with the gameplay is that there is a LOT of inventory management required, at least if you want to i. have adequate gold and ii. don't want your inventory to look like a crazy bag lady got a hold of it.

The combat is great, targetting has been improved and what the reticle shows will happen is the actual result for the most part.

I thought that feeling was researved for my childhood, I'd never get that vibe going forward with life, So this alone, Is enough for me to recommend this gem. Playing with a crew of life long friends has made it all the more amazing, The disfuntional moments and those times when we pull ourselves together and make things work, to the times when we die in glorious style. We've laughed, given into cheeky impulses, shed a few RP tears, and every step of the way wanted to push fowards to further glory (it has been very hard to put down to sleep) I think what brings the worlds together for me, was the freedom, we could split up, go anywhere wits would allow, kill anyone who we thought insulted our huge egos. though often we had to reload from a monumental failure, replaying fights was never a dull moment. on Tacticain mode we could not get over how cunning the AI was, It would do things we struggled to think of ourselves at times. It would run for cover when it needed to, it would exploit every eviromental angle it could, it felt more human than us but with enough human like choices not to seem robotic. Possibly the best AI I've seen, ever. My Cons: :I feel lost when in comes to recipies, without wanting total knowledge (guides) I was hoping atleast some hints would follow, I've not explored it a great deal, but I feel I'm at 30hours, avioding it. :Some minor times when range would have clear line of sight, yet to hit an object instead, but I'm talking minor. :Cannot barter when another is bartering with the same character, I understand perhaps immersion, but convenience, It can be a little annoying. Pros: :Visuals, sounds, all just perfect. :Writing quality and quantity, just amazing. :Freedom of choice, wield any weapon/gear, sandbox relationships. :Humor inducing deaths and accidents. :Customization, and the feeling of power with every spell/gear. :Combat spell elemental synergy, enviromental impact, and fluid easy to understand mechanics. :Morals and ethical choices, not always black and white. :Dark ideals, and sinnister characters. :Fast loading, mostly instant. :Great difficulty, hard is hard. expect to think/pray. :Sense of adventure, always more ways than one to do something, exploration rewarded. :Workshop! Thankyou! this has to be the first game for me in a long time, I can safely say, beats expectations by miles, and gives me hope for the future of games again.

There are several exceptions obviously and many fantasy games have some charcteristics taken from D&D even if only minor ones. This is D&D the video game. You CANNOT get closer without playing D&D or a similar table top with a group of friends. There is even multiplayer, which is amazing. This game is excellent and so story rich it is hard not to get totally absorbed, There is really only one progression path it seems in the main quest set but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. I suggest playing a charcter with an orgin story as they provide a more immersive experience, and intrestting dialogue options in some situations. I haven't taken the time to use the Dungeon master mode but from what I've seen it makes game play essentially endless if full utilized.

412,"This review will be most helpful for the type of gamer like me, and the following is what I like/look for and rate games on: - immersive dialouge/story - 9/10 - auditory experience - 8/10 - challenging playthrough - 10/10 - immersive dialouge/story - The D&D style narrations and dialouge options had me spending hours loading and tweaking conversations just to uncover how many nuances there are to be had in the game. Only on my second playthrough (because I can't stop) am I realizing how much story you will uncover or leave uncovered depending on who in your party is the flag-ship communicator with NPC's. I haven't felt this satisfied with dialouge since I played Fallout 2, if thats a good reference. - auditory experience sound effects, voice-acting, and sound tracks. These make up about 50% of what makes a game immersive for me. Every NPC is voice-casted well, sound effects are great, and the music is incredibley well done. Only reason for 8/10 is because, due to bugs or something, there will be lulls between tracks, effectively inturrupting the flow (imagine watching your favorite movie in the theater and a phone lights up). Fix this, add a few new tracks, and this goes to 10/10. - challenging playthrough I loved WoW years ago (2007-2008) because of the way the game punished you for overestimating opponents and underestimating preparedness. RPG's today feel so overly generous to players in combat, and I was *overly excited* to find myself becoming angry and loading the game multiple times from dying. I also have only played this game on Tactician, and I highly recommend it.","November 9, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

416,"Pure RPG Perfection. This is an RPG in the truest form. Let me be clear, this game doesn't do any hand holding. From the character creation to party selection, you are really writing your own story. The combat is the most entertaining turn based system I have ever played. Your enemies will be very tough encounters but every encounter teaches you how to use your parties skills and the terrain to your advantage and you eventually start to win. Winning a fight in this game feels very very rewarding. If you loved the RPG's of old but want to experience them in a modern, compelling way in 2017, there is simply no better experience than Divinity: Original Sin 2 9.5/10","September 17, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

421,"This game takes the rich story, great turn-based combat and awesome character progression from the previous game and has built/improved it by tenfold. Adding in extra races, characters with origin stories that actually effect the story of the game, having a storyline that makes more sense then the last game and adding in romance options has really created an atmosphere that exeeds the previous game. Adding in more spells (a new school has been added; Polymorph) and adding physical armour and magic armour instead of just health has really expanded on the combat. The only con to this game is the quests and the way that they are explained/the player is directed. This was a problem in the previous game, where if you don't do the quest exactly as the game wants it, you won't complete it. As well as this, the game once again doesn't explain quests adequetly. Quests will have very vague references that leave the player running around entire maps not understanding what the next step is. This was a very big problem for me in the Driftwood area, where there were a lot of quests, but I was given literally nothing to give me a clue as where to go. I'd still give the game a 9/10 regardless, because I liked this game very much, and still continue to play it. There's a lot more content here than the previous game.","September 19, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

423,"If you remember the golden age of RPGs with titles like Baldur's Gate I&II, Jagged Alliance, Icewind Dale, or Planescape Torment then this is the game for you. It's a masterpiece at every level, and even had a surprise at release with over 80,000 lines fully voice acted. That's insane, and really makes Larian one of most realiable and trusted names in video gaming. I can't heap enough praise on them, and this time multiplayer is simply astonishing. + Darker than DOSI, with a much more compelling storyline and script + Unique take on character races. Elves eat flesh to reveal their secrets. Undead heal only with poison, and are engrossing to play. + Combat system is one of the best, and the Ai is challenging, especially on tactician mode. + Loot is balanced, and rewards the player depending on your choices. + Beautiful game, and downright stunning at times. I find myself sitting idle just marveling at some of the game's foilage, and enviroments. + It's optimized for lower end systems, and they are saying Mac support is likely as well. + RNG elements have been minimized with a tremendous loot system that makes each playthrough unique, but dependable. + Highly custimizable skills and talents that truly allow you to make whatever you deem worthy of your time, and party composition. + Multiplayer/Co-op are amazing, and even more enjoyable than the solo matches + All Origin characters have depth, personalities, and stories that are woven into the fabric of the game. Events will trigger only for certain combinations, or interactions. It constantly surprises you. + Fully voice acted (80,000+ lines), and damn good too. + The game is gigantic, and the tutorial island takes nearly 30+ hours to get through. - Addictive, and you will want to stockpile food, and other goodies for your travels. - The occasional glitch, but they are far and few, and easily overlooked by everything else","September 20, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

426,"The good: A very polished game, stunning graphics, voice acting, drop in-out co-op, multiple paths, re-play off the chain. Game Master is a legitimate contender for Roll20 and like web sites for RPGs. They should try and copy what this game has done, but with more of a D&D rule system. The bad: If you like the PC doing the random save versus spells, you will not like the Magic and Physical armor combat. This is not D&D rules. Combat will always come down to keeping your armor up while trying to strip the enemies and using a bundle of crowd control to keep them from attacking you. I wish enemies scaled to your level. Example, if you fight hard enemies of superior level early, you will have a great challenge and might have to do multiple re-loads to win…BUT later you go to areas you missed or should have hit earlier and completely walk over the enemies who are of lower level. The mix: Once you understand the game mechanics and accept them, you begin to understand how to win battles against superior AI opponents through solid strategy. The meh: The PC AI is hit or miss. While there are times the AI does smart counters to your efforts, often it is the AI’s lack of intelligence that allows you to overcome those odds and cheapens the victory. I can boast that I finished the game and will likely do multiple runs. Second, I have completed a lavish GM campaign that I will post in the workshop, so I have a complete understanding of the game. Lastly, I’ve been gaming since pong…need I say more? Final thought: If you want to experience everything this game has to offer, it would take multiple play throughs…some might see this as good, while others will see it as just too much an investment. With GM mode I give this game an 9/10, without it an 8.","November 21, 2017",3 people found this review helpful
427,"If Divinity: Original Sin is a Messiah-like return to form in open, expansive, story-heavy RPGS, then D:OS2 is the second ♥♥♥♥ing coming. Absolutely nothing I've very played can top this game in its gravitas. The story is clever and riveting from the beginning to the end, and keeps the player rabidly invested in the development of both the characters and the state of the world. The story is supported masterfully by the (fully voice acted) dialogue, ambient music, and gorgeous art. The combat in this game just... makes sense. Veterans of RPG games will have no trouble understanding the system, but even newcomers to the genre can pick it up in the space of a few battles. The game's combat continues to throw you curveballs in terms of player and enemy abilities, but they all fit snugly within the bounds of the overarching system. You'll feel like a strategist, unconsciously planning out the best ways to apply your characters' different abilities to best slay enemies with different armour types and quantities. Divinity is an apt title for this franchise. The gameplay, story, and aesthetics are all worthy of that mantle. I could honestly see this game as a contender for best RPG of all time.",February 13,3 people found this review helpful

Huge amount of customization and deep combat system. Keep in mind this game is 1) quite long 2) requires you to read, think, and sometimes retry things a different way, 3) takes a bit to warm up.

The in game lore and stories play well from one arc to the next and the scenes in which they are set are beautiful. My only complaints about this game would be the lack of interesting none human player races, though the lizard folk are really nicely designed. The fact you can move far enough away from active combat (sometimes) to leave combat and thus get infinite and free action economy whilst the rest of your team is playing turn by turn.",April 26,3 people found this review helpful

440,"One CRPG to rule them all, one CRPG to inspire them, One CRPG to bring them all and in the darkness enthrall them In the land of Steam where Divinity shall never die. .... There are only two things you need to know about Divinity: Original Sin 2. First, within one week of launch it became the highest-rated games of all time on Metacritic (it currently has a metascore of 95). Second, all of that critical acclaim is completely deserved. You see, a very long time ago there was a game called Baldur's Gate 2. It was incredible. An enormous CRPG with engaging combat, compelling characters, and an intriguiing narrative. It demonstrated just how good a roleplaying game could be, and established a standard of quality that would cast a shadow over every subsequent CRPG for decades. For a very long time, we convinved ourselves that Baldur's Gate 2 was an outlier. An abberation. That we would never see another game of similar scope, scale or quality again. And that we were wrong to expect such grand ambitions from even our most beloved of developers. But we were wrong. Divinity Original Sin 2 is the game we have been waiting for. It is a spectacular, transcendental experience. Compex, challenging gameplay married to a well-written and extraordinarily dynamic narrative; gorgeous visuals and skilled voice acting; a phenomenal soundtrack and an overall design that grants players an unprecedented level of freedom. But you know all of this already. Original Sin 2 has already thoroughly enmeshed itself into the zeitgeist. That metascore did not happen by accident, and you know it. The 10,000+ user reviews that are almost exclusively positive are likewise no accident. This is it. The game that was promised. The game we never thought would come. Divinity Original Sin 2 is, finally, the true successor to Baldur's gate, not because it has a similar style of gameplay, or a similar tone or narrative style, but because of what it represents: a new standard for the genre. Truly, it is one CRPG fit to rule them all.","October 3, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

444,"This is a really good RPG that is constantly receiving balance and bug fixes, while listening to it's community. Pros: ++ NPCs REACT to things and I can't describe how essential this is for a good RPG; the tag system, your class and race choice, talents and attributes, quest choices, etc, make the NPCs say different things each time, it doesn't even matter if they don't lead to major changes about half of the time, the fact that they exist puts this game a little over most other RPGs. ++ Constantly improving. ++ Can do an almost infinite combination of skills and classes, and pretty much all of them work. ++ Multiple ways to complete almost every single quest in the game. ++ Very good completionist game, requires no multiplayer and all achievements are related to single unique tasks or milestones, (needs more than one playthrough for 100% completion and needs at least one of those to be on honour mode). + Varied equipment and multiple armor sets. + Big open areas with epic fights that can lead to awesome adrenaline filled moments. + Rewards exploration, replaying the game, and learning the mechanics. + Can be played alone or with friends. + Larian Studios is one of the best developers out there, they published continuous game updates through the development process. Cons (Keep in mind that most of these things mostly apply for Tactician or Honour mode): - - Tactician and Honour mode not only need vast knowledge of the game, but also luck and a strong focus on one source of damage. - - Requires one single Persuasion focused character and discourages you from using two of them since you can't use other characters to intervene during conversations using their own attributes for persuasion checks (like you can in Wasteland 2 for example), which makes the speaker feel like a lone adventurer everytime you're not in battle. - - As of March 2018, NPCs are doing weird things on tactician and honour, for example, making ice surfaces, then casting fire on them to make steam and water, then turning the surface back to ice; casting Death Wish on opponents and not using certain gap closing skills unless damage can be dealt right after. - Some skills feel really weak considering they cost the same points as others. - You may or may not like the armour system, I didn't like it at first, but it grew on me over time. - A certain talent (Lone Wolf) makes the game EXTREMELY easy, except for the starting area, when you don't have decent gear. - Easy to fall into minmaxing on these difficulties, since in reality, there isn't any other choice to beat them reliably.","September 26, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

454,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This review will cover each aspect of the game and will be updated after full release: sound, gameplay, story, art etc. Some things can only be understood if you actually experience them, so I won't go into much detail about those amazing things that make this game stand out from anything I have ever played. The sounds, and music are part of this experience and I can't really describe how calming the sound of waves lapping on the beach is, or how tense the screams of a sadistic tortue chamber changes the atmosphere of the game. Sound and music are excellent. Full voice acting for all characters really encases you within the immersiveness of this world. I've enjoyed 100 hours on the first Original Sin, and 150 hours on the Enhanced Edition, and the gameplay that made that game such a success has only been evolved and molded into a what can only be described as a masterpiece. I'll start with the simplest form of gameplay: Combat. While simple in essence, the amount of possibilities and ways to approach every battle give the combat in this game replayability and makes it never feel monotonous. You will find yourself planning turns ahead, baiting enemies into a tighter space, saving AP and waiting to spring a trap on them- just for your enemies to do the same to you. Early access only has access to a ""medium"" difficulty, and as a veteran of the series I can say that while it isn't a walk in the park, it won't require too much out of a well thought out party. Character planning and preparedness make the difficulty in my opinion, as starting battles differently will show you that a battle that you may have once thought very hard, can become very easy if starting it out thinking outside the box. Picking up that oil barrel you saw way back, carrying and sneaking it into the middle of an enemy pack, sneaking out, and opening combat with that firescroll you have been saving since the beginning of the game is just one of the many ways you can make the game easier for yourself. While the game rewards thinking in that aspect, one of my favourite things about this game so far is that it DOESN'T reward you traditionally. A talent ""Pet-Pal"" will let you talk to animals, and you may expect that every animal you talk to should give you something in return, by nature of spending a hard-earned talent point on the ability. While sometimes that may be the case, more-often than not you are rewarded with a thought-provoking sentiment from a creature that is just trying to survive in this crazy world. Consoling and replacing an orphaned bear's parental figure, or trying to explain to a dog what death means won't give you EXP or skills, but will tweak your heart-strings and remind you that there is nothing you can't expect in this world that larian has created. The story of this game is interesting, as it will be very different depending on who you are playing as, or who you are playing with. 6 Origin characters each have their own goals and will play the game according to their needs. And even if you aren't playing as them, they will continue throughout the world trying to accomplish their unique goals. And woe be to those that will stand in their way. Will you help them or turn them against each other? Or pursuade them to join you? Or use them to as a means to an end to find better treasure and kill them when their usefulness has run out? The characters are vastly improved upon the first game and out of everything, this is the part of the game that is the most improved and the most exciting for fans of original sin. The only thing I can reccommend to players both new and old is that you really try to do EVERYTHING. If you think it may be possible, just try it out. What does 10 points in telekenisis and a really heavy object look like over-top of the enemies head? Sneaking Pacifist playthroughs? A character that lights everything around them on fire, then has their fire spells reduced in cost because of them standing on fire, and having so much fire-resist that they are healed by standing in it? The replayability of this game is insane because there are too many viable options to discover and explore. The best part about it all is that you can play with 3 other people and do it all together.","September 5, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

461,"An absolutely incredible experience, without a doubt, one of the finest rpgs to date, it certainly is the best I’ve ever played. I wouldn’t know where to begin, the world is as interesting and alive as the long and beautifully crafted story, which stays strong for almost all of its entire 130h runtime. If you’re new to rpgs, you might be put off by the inherent amount of lore and world building exposition these kinds of games often exhibit, but I must say that the game does a remarkable job of giving you all the information you need without overwhelming you. The world building is constant and just detailed enough as to make you want to fill in the details yourself using your own imagination. Having not played the original Divinity Original Sin, I did not once feel like I was missing some important piece of lore or that I had missed out on anything story-wise, which is something I truly appreciate from the developers. The writing is witty, fresh and fully voice acted. Not one person, monster or animal goes without a voice. The voice acting is also excellent, a pleasant surprise seeing how much has been had to be dubbed. Combat is a lot of fun, and it only gets better the more you level up and are able to experiment with new interesting skills and combos; the only thing I feel could have been done better is how the different skill trees are explained. As it stands, only a very basic description is given, when important information, like that hydro spells are in the most part curative or that pyro spells focus more on damage should be explained somewhere. This is not such a major issue due to the fact that players are given the opportunity to respec at any time once they reach a certain point in the story (fairly early) , but still, it does make investing into certain trees a bit dangerous and daunting as a new player. Overall, the game has provided me with a beautiful experience and I’m left reminiscing about my adventures in Rivellon alongside my memorable companions, thinking about what I could have done differently. If you have even a passing interest in rpgs, try it, you won’t regret a second of it.",March 31,3 people found this review helpful

474,"Just a disclaimer, this is my first time playing this type of game. I have never been interested in them, but with all the praise this game has been receiving, I figured I would buy it to try it out. I have been thoroughly impressed with the quality and quantity of the game thus far, especially for the cheaper price tag. The level of complexity with the combat system and crafting is unmatched, I feel like I discover new ways to play the game every few minutes. It can be a difficult game, though that makes it so satisfying when you win a battle. The game doesn't hold your hand, and my friend started out feeling overwhelmed by what we could or couldn't do. The tactical decision making sort of reminds me of Dragon Age: Origins, though more in-depth by far. Performance is pretty good, there isn't SLI support, though you probably won't need it. The game dropped frames significantly once when surrounded by fire, smoke, gas, and electricity in a high foliage area. I fully recommend this game if you're even remotely on the fence about it, and I look forward to spending hundreds of hours mastering different classes.

477,"My personal Review to Divinity: Original Sin 2 So, lets get this straight, this game is a master-piece. It's a game like XCOM: Enemy Unkown its a game like The Witcher its a game like Dragon Age and many more... Divinity is not for everyone, but it is for everyone who loves MMO/RPG/TBG I try to be spoiler free, but i will include stuff in this review that is obvious. Character Editor There are a few thing's that i want to talk about, mostly good. You can create your own char in this game, and it's not only for the look, it changes the gameplay for the entire game. There are a few races, Human's, Lizard's, Drawf's, Skeleton's, Elf's... Every Race has a unique talent, example: Elf's can eat body Part's and know what happened to them or what they thought about while they died, sound strange? Yes it is. But it help's you in-game to find hidden treasures or hidden quest's. Even the NPC's are reacting to your Gender/Race/Behavior. You can choose your own Style, i dont mean hair, face, etc. i mean... how your char is reacting to things... example: I mad a Noble Lizard, that talk's like it has a stick up her♥♥♥♥♥♥ I role-play her like she is a Annoying know-it-all. This way, your story takes different out comes. So watch out what you pick. The only thing that bugs me is, that i cant change how tall my char is, how the body looks... Also, some gear looks weird on the body of the chars, they look more fat in some of these, and some are way to skimpy. There are also many trait's and Skills you can pick but thats too much to go in to... You just need to know one think... there is everything from the normal knight to cleric. This might be a spoiler for an enemy in the game: What can i say? There is a♥♥♥♥♥♥tone of loot... i dont know how much and how different they are, but what i saw so far... simply -amazing- I just noticed, here and there, some clothing and loot looks the same... different item stats, but what will you do with a such big game? The Trading is very simple to use, easy to access, quick to understand. Sadly, this is the only point i am slighty disappointed, its not bad for me, but i think some people might notice very quickly, that there are not that many different enemy types. Yes there are plenty, but for the length of this game, it might get boring. I dont mean the fights, i mean the types, i go to the fights after this section... Oh boy... the NPC's... Where do i start? Simply put, they all are very good written, +1 to the writer's. They never get boring, it feels like every NPC has a story... also, they all are voiced, but sometimes here and there, they dont speak, mostly for stuff like But still, its amazing how much time they put in to the voice acting... and the Narrator... gosh, very good job... you mostly hear his voice, he is describing EVERYTHING you see, smell, feel, do. Its truly amazing. Sometimes you hear the same voice actor from another person... but this is not a biggy. They did the same in Oblivion, but i dont mind, some people do but not me, a simple little thing. Alright, lets make this one short, There is the PvP in alpha/beta, quite fun, then you are able to play the Story with 3 others... other player. It's super fun, but i recommend to play with someone you know or to scream at... if you play with randoms... they attack the guard... many... times... its a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sometimes people dont do that, but many do... So now to the D&D section, Thats one of the best features the game can offer right next to the single-player. I recommend not to access the Game Master Mode, many spoilers there, enemy types, loot etc. It's hard to describe, but all you need to know, its like a level editor, or like that one thing from Arma 3 Zeus mode. You can role Dice, you can possess NPC's you can do all kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ But... you need to do all by your self. That means, no NPC's walking around, only you, moving people from A to b. Would be cool if they would add something like a Waypoint/patrol mode so people are walking around citys, taverns etc. SO, the main thing in divinity: Original Sin 2 is the battles, fights, etc. I tried something harder then easy mode - died. You need some training in the beginning but you will find a way to deal with different enemy types and 'areas'. By Area, i mean... You surrounding. There are some different types of 'things' laying around... Let's talk about the basic of the basic, we all know it, we all hate it. You can ignite Oil with fire, you can throw oil at enemy's, you can burn an enemy and lead him in to a puddle of oil so they explode in a cool way. There are some other thinks like Water and wetness, combined with electricity... just try stuff... its super fun to combine these elements... you can also use magic to make it cursed ;) Yes! 100% but when you are a fan of TBG/MMO/RPG's video games. A few games as example: There are just a hand full of good MMORPG's out there, and if you like turn based combat, then its the perfect game for you, you can waste so many hours in this game, finding the best way to solve problems without fighting. You coudl play this game for a long time just to find out what else is hidden in this game. Gather some friends, play D&D online master the dungeons together. When you search a game with 100% on Metacritics or 10/10 IGN- Would Burn again then... you found it. It cost a lot of money, but its worth it. I think this game was on Kickstarter once too, but just look at it... so much time and effort. If there is a game that's worth the money, it's this one.",January 15,3 people found this review helpful

Baldurs Gate (both), Icewind Dale (both), Fallout (all of them), Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Planescape, Tides of Numenara, Tyranny, Wasteland, Pillars of Eternity, Divinity (all of them), Dragon Age (all of them, unfortunately) and more and more and more. This is one of the best of them. Great setting, different enough to be interesting, but not too strange ... you can identify with story and characters ... oh, yes, interesting characters, too. Combat makes great use of abilities and environment. It can be tough but that's part of the fun for me. I think also that it might have a lot of replayability because you can choose a number of different Origin characters who seem to get slightly different story arcs. Story ... for my taste way better than Original Sin 1 (same goes for most quests). Can't wait to learn more. Voice acting (Larian originally did not plan to do it) is a great addition and adds a lot to the game. I backed this game on Kickstarter, it was a no-brainer because Larian did great work with Original Sin 1 and is simply a great company, very much in touch with their fans and customers. Great company, gem of a game and to top it of: an editor.

The combat and all questing is never boring. The game has been a real sense of accomplishment playing through it, it's so much fun to play with friends, so I'd really recommend this as a co-op game. However, playing solo is also very fun. All other games since I bought D:OS 2 have been outclassed by it in sense of enjoyment for me. Not a short game either with all the mod capabilities, and I've played about halfway through the story in about 122 hours and I've still so much more to explore in the game.

The second game catapults that formula to the stars. It stands alone as having the most freedom any RPG has ever given a player. With the quality of AAA game, and love of a passion project, this game is just about perfect. Stop reading this and go buy it.","September 3, 2017",3 people found this review helpful
497,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This review will cover each aspect of the game and will be updated after full release: sound, gameplay, story, art etc. Some things can only be understood if you actually experience them, so I won't go into much detail about those amazing things that make this game stand out from anything I have ever played. The sounds, and music are part of this experience and I can't really describe how calming the sound of waves lapping on the beach is, or how tense the screams of a sadistic tortue chamber changes the atmosphere of the game. Sound and music are excellent. Full voice acting for all characters really encases you within the immersiveness of this world. I've enjoyed 100 hours on the first Original Sin, and 150 hours on the Enhanced Edition, and the gameplay that made that game such a success has only been evolved and molded into a what can only be described as a masterpiece. I'll start with the simplest form of gameplay: Combat. While simple in essence, the amount of possibilities and ways to approach every battle give the combat in this game replayability and makes it never feel monotonous. You will find yourself planning turns ahead, baiting enemies into a tighter space, saving AP and waiting to spring a trap on them- just for your enemies to do the same to you. Early access only has access to a ""medium"" difficulty, and as a veteran of the series I can say that while it isn't a walk in the park, it won't require too much out of a well thought out party. Character planning and preparedness make the difficulty in my opinion, as starting battles differently will show you that a battle that you may have once thought very hard, can become very easy if starting it out thinking outside the box. Picking up that oil barrel you saw way back, carrying and sneaking it into the middle of an enemy pack, sneaking out, and opening combat with that firescroll you have been saving since the beginning of the game is just one of the many ways you can make the game easier for yourself. While the game rewards thinking in that aspect, one of my favourite things about this game so far is that it DOESN'T reward you traditionally. A talent ""Pet-Pal"" will let you talk to animals, and you may expect that every animal you talk to should give you something in return, by nature of spending a hard-earned talent point on the ability. While sometimes that may be the case, more-often than not you are rewarded with a thought-provoking sentiment from a creature that is just trying to survive in this crazy world. Consoling and replacing an orphaned bear's parental figure, or trying to explain to a dog what death means won't give you EXP or skills, but will tweak your heart-strings and remind you that there is nothing you can't expect in this world that larian has created. The story of this game is interesting, as it will be very different depending on who you are playing as, or who you are playing with. 6 Origin characters each have their own goals and will play the game according to their needs. And even if you aren't playing as them, they will continue throughout the world trying to accomplish their unique goals. And woe be to those that will stand in their way. Will you help them or turn them against each other? Or pursuade them to join you? Or use them to as a means to an end to find better treasure and kill them when their usefulness has run out? The characters are vastly improved upon the first game and out of everything, this is the part of the game that is the most improved and the most exciting for fans of original sin. The only thing I can reccommend to players both new and old is that you really try to do EVERYTHING. If you think it may be possible, just try it out. What does 10 points in telekenisis and a really heavy object look like over-top of the enemies head? Sneaking Pacifist playthroughs? A character that lights everything around them on fire, then has their fire spells reduced in cost because of them standing on fire, and having so much fire-resist that they are healed by standing in it? The replayability of this game is insane because there are too many viable options to discover and explore. The best part about it all is that you can play with 3 other people and do it all together.","September 5, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

As it stands, only a very basic description is given, when important information, like that hydro spells are in the most part curative or that pyro spells focus more on damage should be explained somewhere. This is not such a major issue due to the fact that players are given the opportunity to respec at any time once they reach a certain point in the story (fairly early) , but still, it does make investing into certain trees a bit dangerous and daunting as a new player. Overall, the game has provided me with a beautiful experience and I’m left reminiscing about my adventures in Rivellon alongside my memorable companions, thinking about what I could have done differently. If you have even a passing interest in rpgs, try it, you won’t regret a second of it.",March 31,3 people found this review helpful

This is THE spritual successor to the Baulder's Gate games that have made their homes in our hearts, some long time ago. Here are reasons I believe this game DESERVES your money: NO Micro-transactions. Likely, NEVER. NO Anti-Consumer ""Monetization"" schemes. NO Bullsh*t. This game is everything you could want from a game - Epic, honest, and continually nurtured by the devs (Larian Studios).

I spent over 100 hours on the starting island of Fort Joy completely f*$#ing around and having a blast. At one point, I collected/stole basically everything I could and just laughed or nodded in respect at the wordplay/detail in the descriptions of each item.

516,"Great game, but still dumb mechanics in combat that cause it to be broken. Anyways, amazing game, Long story, kinda one time play through, but is the best virtual game to duplicate a TableTop RPG. They designed it perfectly for how players want to play. With dual co-op locally, and 4 player coop online, and any mixture of the two. Along with Dungeon master capablilty, and steam ----needs to be fixed in these areas. If you want to play lonewolf, you will without a doubt lose and have a disadvantage later in the game from fighting events that are designed for losing turns..... THATS the problem needing to be addressed... WHY are there so many freaking lost turns in this game. Stunned makes sense, Feared, is okay. Why is knocked down the same as stunned. That destroys LoneWolfs chance and bonus, you need more members to counter lost turn CC. Why isnt it 2AP to stand up from knockdown?

From the character creation to party selection, you are really writing your own story. The combat is the most entertaining turn based system I have ever played. Your enemies will be very tough encounters but every encounter teaches you how to use your parties skills and the terrain to your advantage and you eventually start to win.

525,"I've got to do a full review here, because this is probably one of the best games ive ever played. The only other RPG I've been this engrossed in since childhood is probably Witcher 3. I legitimately am just looking forward to the end of my shifts at work because I want to just go back to playing D:OS2. First, the side quests are super fleshed out and frankly revolutionary in a way that I hope sets precedents for future RPGs. Remember how we all praised witcher 3 for having a lot of side quests but none of them being simple mindless fetch-quests like in Bethseda RPGs? This game has one-upped that: the game is jampacked with side quests, none of them are fetch quests, and you have a variety of ways of completing them that can change how the quest develops and rewards you without the options being inherently wrong. There are ways to fail the sidequests, sure, but there's also fleshed out ways of completing quests (read: It's not '""You get Dialogue B instead of Dialogue A because you clicked text Option B instead of Option A). You have unique ways that make the story of the side quest finish in unique ways which end in unique rewards. In fact, the way you complete one side quest can have a domino effect that can change other things in the game including the options you have to complete other quests. It makes the world feel alive and dynamic and I hope this becomes a RPG staple. Second, the combat is exquisite. It's everything great about the tactical and in-depth customization Original Sin 1 had but better. New classes, a more balanced AP system, etc. Basically, you get four action points per turn that can be used to attack, to move, cast spells, etc. Typical S-RPG stuff. However, the depth of the tactics you can pull off is pretty much the best there is gaming. Just to give you an idea of how the combo system works: If you use a fire spell, the spot you hit will now be 'burning'. Walking over it will cause fire damage and set a burning DOT condition. Use a water spell? Well now it's extinguished! But there will be a steam cloud, and if you use lightning on it you can stun everyone inside that cloud. That's a small sample of what you can do: You can fly, teleport, ram, sneak, whatever you want through combat and the amount of combos and unique interactions you can find are limitless. It feels like every single 'quintessential' fantasy rpg archetype was lovingly crafted into the combat. The game came out like a week ago and I already have 60 hours in it. All I think about when I'm at work is how much longer until I can play Divinity again. I haven't felt this way about a video game since I was a little kid. My main save has about 30 hours in it and I'm probably like 1/4 through the game (also got a 2nd save for the co-op). I haven't even touched Game Master mode (which is basically Dungeons and Dragons with full control of basically every asset in the game) and Arena (PVP) yet. I could see myself easily logging hundreds of hours on this game. This is hands down game of the year and hands down one of the best games I've ever played. I had huge hopes for this game and was really worried it wouldn't live up to the hype. But this is hands down everything I could have wanted from a sequel to D:OS1. You're missing out if you don't get it.","September 16, 2017","3 people found this review helpful

530,"Amazing and immersive story, incredible soundtrack and the first RPG that really sunk me in. The atmosphere of the game is somewhat dark, but humorous at times with a sprinkle of childlike light themes. Has lovable, charming, but yet believable characters. The combat and all questing is never boring. The game has been a real sense of accomplishment playing through it, it's so much fun to play with friends, so I'd really recommend this as a co-op game. However, playing solo is also very fun. All other games since I bought D:OS 2 have been outclassed by it in sense of enjoyment for me. Not a short game either with all the mod capabilities, and I've played about halfway through the story in about 122 hours and I've still so much more to explore in the game. Would really recommend - best RPG experience I've had.",January 15,3 people found this review helpful
531,"I absolutely recommend this game. It plays like a classic RPG with turn based combat, action economy, skills, spells, multiple ways to build your characters, even multi classing and having it have drop in drop out 4 player cooperative is a very nice feature, can even be modded to have larger parties though you will unbalance the game for yourself and disable achievements. The in game lore and stories play well from one arc to the next and the scenes in which they are set are beautiful. My only complaints about this game would be the lack of interesting none human player races, though the lizard folk are really nicely designed. The fact you can move far enough away from active combat (sometimes) to leave combat and thus get infinite and free action economy whilst the rest of your team is playing turn by turn.",April 26,3 people found this review helpful

Gameplay is fantastic, the story is gripping, voice acting is superb and pretty much every single design choice of this game is masterful.

533,"I buy almost almost all of my games months or years after they come out and after they are deeply discounted because I am both cheap and patient. I paid full price for this one, and I am very pleased with the purchase. The application of turn-based combat mechanics to old-school RPG gameplay makes Divinity a very worthwhile experience. It's like Neverwinter Nights had a beautiful lovechild with Xcom. It's also a huge game with huge number of ways to play, and I particularly like that you can play it local-coop. My wife and I are always in the market for a good couch-coop game, and this one is spectacular. My only complaint with the gameplay is that there is a LOT of inventory management required, at least if you want to i. have adequate gold and ii. don't want your inventory to look like a crazy bag lady got a hold of it. I've also found the game to be pretty buggy at times, though it's only actually crashed once in more than a hundred hours of gameplay.",February 20,3 people found this review helpful

539,"Definetely one of the best rpg I ever played and one of my favorite game of all time. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a very refined rpg with a decent 30-ish hours of content without taking into account the amazing replayability (Thanks to the origin character having varying stories and the game having a branching scenario.) The combat system is close to perfect, the bossfights can be very challenging, the voice acting is great, everything is very pretty and each mechanic is really interesting and in-depth. The only way I can describe how great this game is is not by stating the endless list of things it does perfectly, but by listing the only few things it could do better: -A few glitches getting you stuck in dialogues when playing coop -Half of the ending cutscene not playing for players who choosed to fight for Divinity and lost -Easy to overlevel and trivialize the game until the last few bosses And trust me I had to dig deep into my brain to find you that handful of flaws because this game is truly close to perfect. I'm the first person to always find the tiniest detail to ♥♥♥♥♥ about in every single game I play (My friends hates me) but Divinity: Original Sin II is the first game I sunk 8 hours in and surprised myself I didn't get stupidly angry at anything! I'm 250 hours in and I only cleared the story once, I still want to know the side story of Fane and Lohse, I still have quests I forgot to do, and so on! This game is not only great, but it's full of content that will make sure your money spent on its heavy price tag is worth it! I should also mention that the game have a Gamemaster mode that allow you to design and play typical Dungeon and Dragon campaign with your friends online, without the hassle of collecting tons of paper and friends around a table and with the ease of using digital scenery that will nearly always look better than that papier-mâché montian you spent 5 hours on! Overall I believe this game is a must have and even while its price tag is a bit scary, after playing it a bit I knew it was worth the money I spent on it! Really great game, if you like rpgs and especially if you have friends to play with, don't hesitate, this is probably the best rpg of this decade.",August 30,3 people found this review helpful

544,"Scroll to bottom for summary To start off, I just want to say that I am really enjoying this game quite a bit. I never played the first one and I decided to take a risk for myself by purchasing this because I have not played many turn-based strategy games that I truly enjoyed/got addicted to in the past. However this game has me hooked and at the moment I can't think of hardly any reasons as to why I would stop playing it any time soon. Ok, but why? Admittedly this game is definitely not for everyone but hopefully this next part will be helpful to someone who is on the fence about it. If you don't fit into any of the items above then this game probably isn't for you but I would still reccomend that you consider purchasing because as I said earlier, I very rarely enjoy Turn-based strategy games but currently I am enjoying this game a lot. If based on the things mentioned above you think that you like this game, then below is a list of pros & cons. (not in any particular order) (can be re-customized fairly simply without restarting from the beginging of the game) (likely that some of these are bugs that will be patched later) (holding mouse1 or panning to the desired location and clicking) Divinity: Original Sin 2 can provide countless hours of questing, exploring, adventuring, and monster hunting in it's beautifully designed and expansive open-world with countless areas and secrets to find throughout the entire experience which is glued together by a phenomenal soundtrack and wrapped in a cozy blanket of extrodinary storytelling. An absolutely amazing game but I had to take a few points off points for the bothersome movement controls and the friendly AI that tries to kill itself when you are trying to save it.","September 30, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

547,"This is an extremely deep, extremely interesting RPG (gameplay and narrative) that doesn't know how combat works and rushes the everloving Hell out of its ending. The Narrative is Easily the Best Part of this Game The narrative is about power and servitude. A movie would typically tackle this subject using a protagonist and an antagonist in a singular case study. We'd form some kind of opinion on it after seing what goes down between those two people. Original Sin 2 is a 100+ hour videogame that tackles the subject using many protags and antags in many separate and different case studies and thought experiments. This means we form our opinion after seeing the power/servitude dynamic play out in a bunch of different contexts. It's really effective at helping the player form a rich opinion, by the time it's done. But Combat and the Ending are Serious Sore Spots However, there are two jagged thorns stuck deep within the side of this game: combat difficulty and the story's ending. These thorns are so jagged, in fact, that I have a major doubt: the review outlets giving this a 10/10 probably didn't finish the game and probably played it on easy mode. Combat encounters are each either so easy that none of your party even lose their armor, or they're actually impossible to win. There is no middle ground. When they're impossible, this is because the game cheats on behalf of your enemies. They get an astounding number of action points in a turn. They cast the same AoE decimator spell every single turn. They mind control your party through their magic armor. They're a mob, each member of which has infinite initiative, so they all go before your first party member has their turn. Or you make a certain ludicrous decision at the end game and you're faced with a 1v10 that gives you one move to kill everyone. Hilarious. To win these impossible fights, you have to cheat. Save scum, obviously. But, beyond that, you have to reload, then position your party as if they're psychics--in ways you could not possibly have known would work before going into the fight the first time. Or, you have to destroy parts of the environment before stepping on that tile that triggers the fight. Or, you have to kill all the nurses in the Doctor's house before you go and talk to him. Cheat at this game. Become a save-scum psychic and leave your foes baffled at your god-like foresight. And then there's the ending. The gameplay leading to the end is pretty cool. Some complicated puzzles, most of which are literally spelled out for you if you talk to everyone in the final zone. But at least one puzzle will remain unspoiled until you have to complete it. Then, you get a huge boss fight full of cheating enemies that you win by the skin of your teeth. Almost all of those enemies are, as far as I can tell, the biggest narrative inconsistency in history. Then, the narrator gives you some boilerplate about ""remember all that stuff that happened in the game."" That is just barely a paraphrase of what he says. Character- and decision-specificity are at absolute 0 in that boilerplate. Then, he asks ""Remembering that stuff, what do you do?"" You pick one of three choices. I picked the first choice. ""Okay, so you picked the first choice. Now you get this thing. What do you do with it?"" Three more choices. You pick one and get 30-60 seconds of post-game cutscene featuring some vagary about a character that really didn't matter and an extremely brief summary of the way things stand after your decision. And then you're done. Recently, Larian enabled playing after the endgame, so you're brought back to your base to finish side quests or otherwise derp about with your endgame loot. Here's the thing, though. 3/4 of my party died during the last fight. Never got a chance to res anyone. One of that 3/4 was the character I created at the start. So, another party member won the game. Only my created character goes back to base after the credits, and guess what? He's still dead, so I get a game over screen and am asked to reload the boss fight. Nice. This game is extremely good. Addictive, even. It stands tall and proud above most other story-driven games I've ever played. Then, there are the ""challenging"" fights and the sloppy, heartless ending that easily hack off its legs at the knees. Overall, I recommend, because 125/126 hours being fantastic is a great thing. But, that hour of poor quality is a really, super important hour.","October 9, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

552,"I've been holding out on writing a review for this game until I finished it, which took ages because I put the difficulty to tactician mode which made things extremely difficult!! (But very fun!) I put 144H to finish one playthrough. The best way I can put it is: it's probably the best game I've ever played since Witcher 3. I backed this game after playing the first Original Sin, which left me wanting to play even more! I definitely made the right decision. There's a lot of freedom in this game; playing with friends, playing alone and even doing our own DM games. I only played it in Single player mode so far, but I'm very much looking forward to playing with friends when they get the game. Here's a general pros and cons list (from a single player perspective): + Graphics are great + Runs really well + Gameplay is fantastic (if you like turn-based games) + You can pretty much do anything and kill anyone you want + Voice acting is phenominal + Companions each have their own backgrounds which tie in with the main story line, really giving you a sense of wonder and motivation to find out what's going on and how to 'fix' it. + Workshop and Modding (read below for more) - There were a few issues with quests not finishing properly, or not being able to talk properly to some NPCs, leading to missed XP and story (but a lot of that got fixed recently) - Tactician mode is difficult. Really makes you work hard to find as much XP before moving onto other parts. Especially at the beginning of the game. Now here's the BEST part of all this: Larian even gave us the Divinity Engine 2 to us for making our own Campains and DM games. Which means...we can look forward to people creating their own stories and Campaigns in the future - something which I really look forward to seeing and playing. Get it now! It's totally worth it!

553,One of the best games I have ever played and Im not even an RPG player.,"October 19, 2017",3 people found this review helpful
554,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW One of the best RPG experiences I've had in years. It brings back fond memories of old table top days of playing Pathfinder and D&D. It's combat is turned based, but don't let that scare you away. It really does feel like a dynamic game of D&D. The strategy that can go into each situation, whether you try to talk your way out or you just go full murder hobo, is really rewarding. The games only in early access but it releases today. I can't wait to get my hands on the full title. The 11 hours I've played so far have been very enjoyable Every bit as good and in my opinion better than the original. The addition of 100% voice over in the final game is just a big bonus for anyone who doesnt want to read a lot, although in this game its well worth the read or listen now. If you didnt play Divinity original sin, you missed out, but dont worry it really seems like it is not a prerequisite for the sequel. There is definitely stuff in there that is remnants of the past game but the events of the game are 1000 years plus in the future from the original game. I'm really hoping to get to put the game master mode to the test with friends somwhere down the line. The guys and gals at Larian really out did themselves. Talk about underpromising and over delivering. That was pretty much par for the course for this game, and boy am I glad they delivered. I don't want to give the game a full rating yet, but I'm definitely throwing a positive thumbs way up for what i've played so far and from everything theyve shown us coming on release.","September 14, 2017",3 people found this review helpful

I have lost and retraced at least 10-12 hours of my 50 hours of gameplay due to forgetting that this game only quicksaves every blue moon. I understand that there are settings and sliders to determine when saves happen, but either I'm a complete dunce or that system is confusing. ALSO, QUICKSAVE BEFORE FIGHTS HAPPEN. I don't care if they spoil the surprise, just... At the beginning of a hostile area, or whenever you're about to talk to someone who's supposed to kill you, please help a bro out so they don't have to redo their search for source, resurrection scrolls AND two long♥♥♥♥♥fight scenes.

You can tell it's developers were frusterated with the freedom in other games, and made it their mission to create that freedom themselves. And that's just the first game. The second game catapults that formula to the stars. It stands alone as having the most freedom any RPG has ever given a player. With the quality of AAA game, and love of a passion project, this game is just about perfect. Stop reading this and go buy it.","September 3, 2017",3 people found this review helpful
570,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This review will cover each aspect of the game and will be updated after full release: sound, gameplay, story, art etc. Some things can only be understood if you actually experience them, so I won't go into much detail about those amazing things that make this game stand out from anything I have ever played. The sounds, and music are part of this experience and I can't really describe how calming the sound of waves lapping on the beach is, or how tense the screams of a sadistic tortue chamber changes the atmosphere of the game. Sound and music are excellent. Full voice acting for all characters really encases you within the immersiveness of this world. I've enjoyed 100 hours on the first Original Sin, and 150 hours on the Enhanced Edition, and the gameplay that made that game such a success has only been evolved and molded into a what can only be described as a masterpiece. I'll start with the simplest form of gameplay: Combat. While simple in essence, the amount of possibilities and ways to approach every battle give the combat in this game replayability and makes it never feel monotonous. You will find yourself planning turns ahead, baiting enemies into a tighter space, saving AP and waiting to spring a trap on them- just for your enemies to do the same to you. Early access only has access to a ""medium"" difficulty, and as a veteran of the series I can say that while it isn't a walk in the park, it won't require too much out of a well thought out party. Character planning and preparedness make the difficulty in my opinion, as starting battles differently will show you that a battle that you may have once thought very hard, can become very easy if starting it out thinking outside the box. Picking up that oil barrel you saw way back, carrying and sneaking it into the middle of an enemy pack, sneaking out, and opening combat with that firescroll you have been saving since the beginning of the game is just one of the many ways you can make the game easier for yourself. While the game rewards thinking in that aspect, one of my favourite things about this game so far is that it DOESN'T reward you traditionally. A talent ""Pet-Pal"" will let you talk to animals, and you may expect that every animal you talk to should give you something in return, by nature of spending a hard-earned talent point on the ability. While sometimes that may be the case, more-often than not you are rewarded with a thought-provoking sentiment from a creature that is just trying to survive in this crazy world. Consoling and replacing an orphaned bear's parental figure, or trying to explain to a dog what death means won't give you EXP or skills, but will tweak your heart-strings and remind you that there is nothing you can't expect in this world that larian has created. The story of this game is interesting, as it will be very different depending on who you are playing as, or who you are playing with. 6 Origin characters each have their own goals and will play the game according to their needs. And even if you aren't playing as them, they will continue throughout the world trying to accomplish their unique goals. And woe be to those that will stand in their way. Will you help them or turn them against each other? Or pursuade them to join you? Or use them to as a means to an end to find better treasure and kill them when their usefulness has run out? The characters are vastly improved upon the first game and out of everything, this is the part of the game that is the most improved and the most exciting for fans of original sin. The only thing I can reccommend to players both new and old is that you really try to do EVERYTHING. If you think it may be possible, just try it out. What does 10 points in telekenisis and a really heavy object look like over-top of the enemies head? Sneaking Pacifist playthroughs? A character that lights everything around them on fire, then has their fire spells reduced in cost because of them standing on fire, and having so much fire-resist that they are healed by standing in it? The replayability of this game is insane because there are too many viable options to discover and explore. The best part about it all is that you can play with 3 other people and do it all together.","September 5, 2017",3 people found this review helpful
571,"Divinity has always been a great fantasy IP from the first through the Dragon Knight saga and now in Original Sin. I am not usually a big fan of turn based combat and that might give people cause to pause when considering this game, it did with me anyway .... dont let that stop you though. This is a true role playing game something we see so very rarely these days, the turn based mechanic of the combat wont get in your way. In my experance any way the game's turn based mechancis wont adversly impact your enjoyment in any way, if anything you may find you like it if only in this specific case. As to the story, world and characters they are all master strokes through and through, the massive array of options and granular details to game give it huge replayability just in terms of the main campaign and the community have added a lot more via mods and scenarios. Put simply you will get your monies worth out of this game just from the stock content then on top of that you have a great community giving you even more via Workshop and Nexus. Cons? Nothing really, while the game isn't perfect ... simply because nothing is ... there is nothing I would see changed about it that isn't a matter of personal taste and for thouse aspects of taste the community has that covered in mods e.g. difficulty rebalance, spell effects, rate of progression, etc.",September 5,3 people found this review helpful
572,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW For what it is now, it's an awesome game. Spent 17 hours murdering the entire city, clearing out the magisters, and at the end I got to kill some void worm. However it is a little bit buggy, as at the end I got my friend to talk to the final boss while I positioned myself, teleported the ranger and initiated combat on everyone except the guy my friend was talking to. Would be great to see this fixed once they introduce more monsters to kill so you can gain a higher level before fighting this boss, otherwise it is extremely hard, unless I missed something. Other than that, it is a great game for what it currently is. I look forward to seeing it progress further.","September 27, 2016",3 people found this review helpful

Buy it now without any hesitation if you do have time to enjoy the game slowly and you are interested in traditional RPG with turn-based battle mode. The amazing game scene also defeats DOS1 and most of the other similar RPGs. Can't wait to play full version which will release on Sep.14th. Besides, The story line in this game can be decided or changed by the player. HOWEVER, as a Chinese college student passed GRE and TOEFL recently, it is still a HUGE BURDEN for me to understand what the dialog is mainly about. It need great patience to play this game with an e-dictionary app. Hence, I frankly request Larian to take actions to prepare for the CHINESE version now if that is already in your wait-list plan. If you find it too hard to make Chinese version, please try to find a local game translation team, they might be happy to work for you in a quite reasonable price. Again, I highly recommend this game and I shall go on to expand my vocabulary. (haha)","August 13, 2017","6 people found this review helpful

581,"If I am being honest, I will start by saying that Divinity: Original Sin didn’t grab me in quite the same way it so obviously did many others. I saw a lot of merit to its combat, flexible quests and vibrant presentation, but thought the lack of direction, both from a narrative and gameplay standpoint, alongside some tonal issues, were sore points that kept me from really breaking into it. Several years later and Larian Studios have done just what I hoped they would, making a sequel that retains the strengths of previous game while addressing just about every issue I had with it, and then going even further with additions like full voice acting, something not generally found in the recent wave of cRPG games. Due to the relatively high difficulty and patience required it may still not be for everybody, but Divinity: Original Sin 2 is very much at the pinnacle of the sub-genre and will no doubt prove intoxicating for those who get trapped in its spell.","October 6, 2017",6 people found this review helpful

585,"A masterpiece no doubt and I would seriously name it game of the year if I may. Been eagerly waiting for this game for months and it doesn’t fail me in a single point. Almost perfect in every aspect and way better than its already amazing prequel (except that I feel I prefer the voice and atmosphere of the female narrator in DOS:EE than that of this male narrator.) Special reference must be made to the music for it is so astoundingly composed that I feel I can just sit there listening to the main theme for hours. Last time a game’s BGM would give me such immersion and pleasure should be playing Skyrim. Larian Studios now officially tops my favorite developer list and this honor should only be shared by CD Projekt Red. These two great studios earn their greatness not only because they make great games, but because the enthusiasm and true love they showed to their works: they try wholeheartedly to polish and perfect their games in every possible way and they always take the players seriously. I sincerely hope DOS2 will be a great success and cement Larian Studios’ ascension to an AAA studio (if it is not already in that list). For this reason I feel real sad for some recklessly given negative ratings: it’s a shame not to show your respect and kindness to such a devoted developer that does not care only about profit maximization as many others do. Edit: this game is indeed giving me the satisfaction only Baldur's Gate 2 has ever given me.","September 15, 2017",6 people found this review helpful

The new concept around physical and magical armor just ruined it for me completely. This is a RPG game, that comes from board games where dices are the main component.

587,"Much like the first game, Divinity Original Sin 2 is a fun game that seems to only be fun purely by accident. There's so much to unpack here that I genuinely suspect that the developers were just randomly throwing darts at a board to decide game elements--at best. At worst they were being intentionally lazy--possibly even intentionally provocative at points. A lot of the major problems have been harped on about to the point where I dont' feel the need to mention them, but for the sake of the uninformed: the armor system in this game is entirely pass/fail, you either have armor and you resist everything or you don't and you resist nothing. The turn order is mindbogglingly terrible, working on a round robin (enemy goes then you go then enemy goes and repeat) system that seems to heavily favor the enemy. The game is literally unfinished, Act 4 was shuffled together out of planks of wood and has blatant cut corners in the form of poor scripting, low effort dialogue, low effort area design, pointless quests and voice acting that varies from being poor to simply not existing. Act 3 is not much better. Inventory management is somehow worse than the first game. I think the best way I could describe the act of playing DOS2 is that if it feels like you are gaming the system, you are probably playing the game the way the developers intended. In someways this is what makes the game fun--I had a very similar experience with New Vegas, where playing the game on the yellowbrick road was boring as sin, but intentionally breaking the quests in ways that favored me was extremely satisfying. What makes DOS2 less satisfying than New Vegas, however, is that in DOS2, the things that break the game are things that the developers knew full well would break it. It is an intentionally asymmetrical experience. Things like teleporting enemies away from their allies and ganking them, planting explosive barrels around enemies before triggering a fight, stacking up on a certain resistance to the point where you heal from an element--these things are how the game is to be played. This of course means that certain abilities are comparitively because they don't do key things like strip armor, reposition allies/enemies, heal, apply surfaces, etc. The top three non-source abilities in DOS2 (Which are probably: Teleportation, Shackles of Pain, Invisibility--which special mentions to Summon Bone Widow and Rain) are so unbelievably powerful that you are gimping yourself to an extreme degree if you do not use them. Balance was clearly of no concern here. On Tactician mode, ""cheese strats"" like the ones I mentioned are so ubiquitious that I legitimately do not understand how the developers intended certain encounters to be beaten. Of particular note is one instance where I needed to save a lizardwoman from the gallows, who was being hung by a single tough guard and her slave. Easy enough, just kill two people. The problem was--as soon as you instigate the fight, the guard , all of which are right next to her so repositioning her is useless. This *by itself* would be a very challenging encounter, but it gets better. The woman had a permanent aura on her that increased her dodging abilities and those of her allies to ludicrous degrees--meaning I basically could not hit her, or anyone around her. The way I beat this encounter was, no joke--teleporting her three times in a row, at max range, into another encounter entirely with some evil bug things, and the bugs killed her. The encounter I just spoke about could have been talked about with the same words, but in an entirely positive tone. Because technically, And that's ""awesome"". Truth be told, it actually was somewhat fun. The crux of the issue is this: the rational person inside of me is screaming in agony when I play Divinity, while the fun-loving idiot inside of me is very satisfied. for a fact that this encounter was unbelivably poor. But because I beat it in a *special* way, I'm almost tricked into believing blatant disregard for things like balance, fairness, and sensibility produced something cool. It's like junk food. It's a momentary rush that quickly wears off when you realize that ""cool trick"" you pulled off was probably just a set of drapes set up to hide a super ♥♥♥♥ed up game. A lot of the encounters are like that, except some are even worse, in that the ""trick"" to the fight is the literal one way to proceed. There's a witch that will set up a MASSIVE fire resistance debuff on your party and then cast a fire spell, instantly killing the entire group. The way to beat this fight without losing a party member is to bless the flames underneath her so you get fire immunity before she casts her debuff. Once you do that the fight is a cakewalk. It is an actual puzzle with one solution. There are other encounters that are just laughably bad. If I played a tabletop RPG where a DM pit me against 15 slow moving clay soldiers that respawn indefinitely until one of them is killed, where each of them gets their own turn and they only have one attack, I would quit that game on the spot. There's another fight that's such a literal waste of your time it's unreal. You start out with dozens of oil slugs, which turn into more slugs, which turn into slugs, which ignites the oil and causes the whole area to be lit on fire, which heals the slugs and hurts you. Also every slug has a ton of HP. That fight took me FIFTY FIVE MINUTES but only took me one try. The final fight: In my DOS1 review, I said the game was flawed to an unbelivable extent, but that I had fun, so I gave it a thumbs up. Why does that not apply here? Because the context behind the game makes the state of the product totally unforgivable. To begin, DOS2 was a kickstarter project after DOS1 had already gotten kickstarted and been the most successful game for Larian in...ever. Additionally, DOS2 was in early access for almost a year and a half, supposedly to gain feedback to improve the product. Larian got feedback, and they ignored it. Changes to the armor system were heavily requested. Changes to the initiative system were heavily requested. Changes to the stat system were heavily requested. None of these things happened. As far as I can tell, Larian did not make a single change to the game during early access that actually made the game better, with the sole exception of adding full voice acting--which was probably planned anyway but only carried out during the pre-release hype. The best part? DOS2 after a YEAR of early acess and a huge crowdfunding campaign. Even ignoring the fact that Act 4 is rushed-out trite, I cannot understand that a high-budget crowdfunded sequel was released with multiple game-breaking bugs. And I mean game breaking. I don't take this stuff lightly. About 15% of the quests I played were bugged to some extent, some of them were literally unfinishable. When I played DOS1, I kind of got the picture that Larian knew what they were doing but were being intentionally transgressive for the sake of being different. Now that I've finished DOS2 I see things in a different light. It really does feel like they just...winged the entire game, and it almost worked.

593,"Product received for free Check out my video for gameplay and so you don't have to read this in depth critical review. YouTube™ Video: Views: 0 Pros I enjoy the world building. For instance, I was going through on a beach and I cam across some alligators. Well, one of these alligators started teleporting around which I thought was pretty odd. After killing them I looted the one that was teleporting around and he had teleportation gloves on him which I thought was kind of cool because they allowed one of my characters to teleport. So, I equipped that and keep moving down the beach and just a little bit further along there was a corpse. looting that corpse gave me a journal and one of the entries talked about being able to teleport. Obviously this alligator ate part of this guy (I guess his hands), got his gloves inside of him and now could teleport. That's really neat. That's cool. I loved that level of world building, it really makes it believable. it makes stuff makes sense and it's unique and that's what's really important. You can build a world that's believable and boring. This one is exciting and I love that. Onto combat. So fighting these guys can be really difficult but in a good way. It's just the right level at least for me on normal. I think it's right there where it's the perfect level of needing strategy, trying different methods, save scumming if needed but enjoying when you finally beat them. Also the elemental combos as I mentioned earlier are fantastic. You can create an oil spill and then another character can catch it on fire. That's wonderful. Of course, that being said there’s a lot of friendly fire. I'm not very good at it yet but I do enjoy it. I think it's a great combat system. Lastly, questing. it's very loose and very believable and I think that's great. The quest giver is not standing there waiting to tell you about how they need you to kill something and then once you talk to them that enemy spawns. Instead you could find that enemy and its spawn and kill it before you even talk to the person and then because you've killed it that might be a good thing or a bad thing. Perhaps they wanted you to loot something and you already sold it or perhaps they needed you to talk to it first. The point is is that the game doesn't necessarily wait for you to move it forward in that sense you can explore at your own pace. You can skip quests or you can not. There is an overarching story arc that will have to be followed but outside of that what you do is what you want to do and I think that's great. All that being said, not all of this I have enjoyed. Now some of this is mildly nitpicking but but hear me out on some of this. First of all there are unlikable characters. What I mean by that is (and mostly I'm talking about Fane and the Red Prince here) - they just look down on you. They’re constantly talking down to you. They might be funny and they might have some good quips and that's great but otherwise they think they're better than you and I don't personally enjoy being talked down to in a game, at least not by the people I'm supposedly partying with. Also a lot of them do the kind of nuanced tropes that we've seen time and time again in fantasy. Really they kind of remind me of like beginner D&D characters. Like your first idea you had. Many of them are from royalty but are either an illegitimate son or lost their kingdom or they're the last of their kind but they're searching for answers - or you know all that kind of stuff has been done to death. They are nuanced and believable but it's not exactly origina. Additionally while playing the game you can accidentally steal stuff quite easily. You don't have to be in sneaking mode to steal. If you accidently click when you're trying to move and there happens to be a stick that somebody owns you will try to pick up that stick which will automatically attempt a theft. If seen you've now lost reputation and people are upset at you leading to you getting in trouble since you've committed a crime. It's annoying and not exactly intuitive nore is it enjoyable. Another issue is the inventory. I feel like the developers haven't decided on what they want. You have an unlimited inventory space so you can carry as many things as you want. There is no 60 panel limit or anything like that. You're not playing inventory tetris like you do in Resident Evil or something like that however, there is a weight system, think Skyrim, Oblivion, that sort of stuff. So you have a limited inventory system but you don't, it depends on how you look at it. Additionally the weight system is so preposterous that you can carry multiple barrels of water in your inventory, making it unbelievable. Either way I'm not sure why they bothered with that as it seems kind of tacked on and unneeded. The gameplay can also be cheated. It's pretty easy to cheese this game in a very obvious way that I'm surprised they didn't really think about. This mainly involves inventory tricks and dialogue tricks. If somebody is in a dialogue for instance,:you start a fight that starts with a dialogue, only one person can converse with them. That means while they're stuck in the conversation you can control your other characters and just move around the battlefield and set up where you want so that you can then swap to the main person that's talking go through that and start the battle at an advantage. With the inventory stuff you can have barrels of ooze that are in your inventory that give you permanent poison arrows or poison potions or you know, whatever. It's pretty obvious and I'm not sure how it wasn't caught in Q&A; or maybe they think that kind of gamifying freedom is nice but I don't particularly enjoy having it there because once I see it I struggle to not use it. Also, I am afraid to say that while this does support mods, installing mods removes the ability to get achievements. I understand some people are really particular about achievements but there are programs out there to where you can unlock achievements with no effort so they are cheated anyway. At that point why make it to where I can't have a mod that allows me to run a bit faster so I can backtrack quicker and still get achievements? As you can see those cons are fairly minor quips. Overall, the world-building, the combat and the questing, all of that as a majority of the game, all of that is very well done. I have enjoyed my time with it. I think it's great fun and I can't wait to spend another hour and then find out I've spent five. Hope for the rest of the game: I do hope that the companions become more nuanced - more believable and kind of stray from that kind of beginner D&D character idea as a defining character trait and instead become their own people. I look forward to the overall story arc becoming apparent. At least on the starting island it's very much in the background it's mentioned kind of right after the ship and then you're just doing your own thing but there's no major stakes at play that are readily apparent or that you know you're going towards some goals somewhere. Also the combat hasn't actually been that varied - the combat is solid and it's well done and they obviously have their ideas together but I want to fight a polymorph. I want somebody to turn my party into a chicken and me have to deal with that. I have no idea how I would deal with that! I want to fight large enemies, not just humanoids and stuff that are maybe smaller or animals. Maybe a dragon or some multi-part boss, that'd be cool. I also want to see more interesting scenario driven battlefields. So far, as soon as you come across an enemy if it's a battle then the battle starts. I want to see kind of like the gladiator fight where the layout is very strategic in that it's kind of pre-made or more scripted at least in the battlefield. You can do some fun stuff with that especially with the different status effects and environmental effects.","October 27, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

595,"Best RPG ever in my honest opinion. ""This game has crazy depth and just really solid turnbase combat. Not to mention the mods (with a provided mod tool to make your own). People can make and upload there own campaign providing endless game content. More then this there is a dungeons master mode that is really solid and allows the DM to make modifications on the fly. Add in controller solid controller support as well as split screen Co-op (up to 2 people for one PC) and 4 player online Co-op AND competitive questing (yes there are multiple, conflicting paths to take in completeing a quest and two or more players can take directly opposing routes in those quests therefore competeing against each other) I do not see how you can not at least respect this game and its developers.

599,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I'm not really into these kinds of turn based rpgs, but this one is different. The combination of ingame objects, combat, and story makes this game so addictive. To progress in the story you need to win fights and to win fights you need good gear, and this encourages exploration. If you are like me (likes action rpgs) then you should try this game. If you can get over the non wasd movement and learn to enjoy the turn based combat, you will love this game. Can't wait till the 14th of September to get the full game.","September 13, 2017",4 people found this review helpful
600,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW If you like PC-style top-down RPG's, you have to get this game. It's really quite that simple. People here have already given descriptions left and right in their reviews, I've very little to add to that. Sufficed to say that where Larian's Original Sin (1) was already a very good game, but had minor nuisances here and there, this one, at fricking Early Access Alpha, already felt, looked, and played like a true AAA title. Everything that was in Original Sin has been improved many fold, all the flaws and nuisances fixed, all the good things perfected, and so, so much more added on top. So much so, that I'd have to write a novel to cover it all. The age of RPG's - in my opinion - has been in decline for a good 10 years with previous big players like BioWare and Bethesda being stuck, even backtracking in their production of quality games. CD Projekt Red managed to start a new evolution of AAA RPG titles with its brilliant Witcher 3, but has so far seen no even remotely serious competition. Now, having played Original Sin 2, it's blatantly obvious that barring some extremely unlikely U-turns in the full release, Larian Studios will be cementing its position as the latest Gold producer with Midas' touch. The overwhelmingly positive reviews in Steam and everywhere else are not a coincidence, as it's easy to see that this game will be a BIG deal. It's quite simply that insanely good.","September 13, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

This is great because this is only a small, unfinished portion of the game, and it's so full of content. Several characters each with their own stories, custom characters with their own story. I have 60ish hours and still find new things each time I play through it. So many different interactions with various elements. New spells, magic schools, and more.

611,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Easily one of the best RPG's I've ever played, and it's still in Alpha. Superb! My only gripe (and it's a HUGE gripe!) is the uber-confusing dialog. It's all written in the third person, so you can't tell if the dialog means 'you' (as in your character who is speaking/acting/thinking) or 'you' (as in the character they are speaking to). WTF? It's ROLE PLAYING! Make the dialog 1st person! Example dialog: (and yes, every selection is enclosed in asterisks for no reason.. no dialog quotes anywhere in the game) 1: *you ask what do you have to do* - Am I asking what I have to do? What the other person has to do? 2: *you demand to let your sword go* - Let my sword go? Let your sword go? 3: *you look puzzled* - Am I looking puzzled as an action? I am saying they look puzzled? 4: *you wonder why the dialog is all in 3rd person, since you can barely tell what's a thought or action or what's actually said out loud (and to whom)* 5: *you facepalm at the ridiculousness of it all; you don't know who 'you' is referring to* Other than that, it's a wonderful game. Of course, the dialog is 1/3 of the entire game, so that's a MAJOR issue. Also, the dialog was written by a non-native english speaker. It's obvious, and slightly irritating since, beyond the above issue, there are some dialog options which make no sense whatsoever, yet can mean the difference between your character living and dying in the game. Example: NARRATOR: *you see a runed vase with an inscription warning you to not pull the lever unless you have fund scrolls to tell* (and yes, all descriptions come in the form of dialog with a pretend person named ""NARRATOR"", instead of just describing the scene in a normal way. Very hokey, and a constant immersion killer.) 1: *you pull the lever, confident you are ready* 2: *you break the vase* 3: *you open the vase and absorb the entity inside* Wait.. What?! WTF does ""have fund scrolls to tell"" mean? Which optin shold I be choosing? How do I back out? PS: You can't back out of dialog, so you MUST make a choice. Your guess is as good as mine what the non-english part is supposed to mean, but the rest of the game is decided in that moment and there are no take-backs. So, yeah, awesome, awesome game, with the most ridiculous dialog/narration I've ever seen.","June 3, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

I saw the game grow from within the kickstartes, I saw Swens comments on the changes, it all looked and felt so good. For backers they had some polls on what we wanted them to focus on.

Before I forget it, this game can even be played in co-op (up to 4 players), what else do you need (maybe some beer, chips and a girlfriend, but that's not important now) For d&d fans they even implemented a game master mode (with one d&d campaign already worked out for your party!) to make sure you will never ever have to play the same story.

628,"I blind-bought DOS2 for the only reason of his private multiplay lan/network options (real great thanks to devs for this) with campaing creating and mastering mode to custom-play with friends. I must admit I was disapointed after few playing hours to realize RPG content isnt as deeply as classic aD&D games and Builder very different of what I hoped with a just succession of very small maps. If you got in your group someone who speaks with animals, have good persuasion and wits scores, with only DamageDealers you're sure you'll miss nothing and progress easely : quests are interesting but dont need any analysis or long searchs, no mortal traps anywhere, no oneshots (maybe with Alice or missing in making Hannag one of your friends), no wipes (except being too optimistic with Adrahmalihk), quite nothing to detect, quite nothing to miss anywhere (Braccus legs ?) and finaly a hardest difficulty mode ""too soft"" for most of players. So... how explain our actual 600hours on DOS2 HM with many différent groups and choices (magical, physical, distants, ranges, with tank, with only DD, 2 lonewolves, wipe maps in genocides, or pacifist ""just alone"") ? For me the biggest quality of this game isnt RPG at all but by-turn-combat options and strategies, with many different builds choices and mix for each member. Every tactical/HM combat is a +/- complex arena where you must analyze options and ways to success. Concerning GameMastering Leaks are finaly forces : this part of game must be seen as a way to play exactly the way you RPG-play around a table, and not to create a big scripted world like with Aurora (NeverwinterNights). Except minor changes in menus, dialogs, a global easier game (...), a new strange corpses ragdoll animation and a bigger game folder, sorry to see DefinityEdition bringing nothing more.

This game is a throwback to the glory days of crpgs like Baldurs Gate, Fallout and many more. Decisions matter, your party matters, everything you do matters. Not only that, but it also offers a rich world, where things happen around you wether you intervene or not. To top it off, the game looks great and has the best soundtrack and sound design I have ever heard. On the other hand you have some minor continuity issues that can prop up if you take the open invitation of the game to play your own way to the extreme and some clunkyness with the UI. Nothing too major, those are things I can tolerate in a game that comes along fully voiced. Comparing this title to other so called RPG's of modern times bar the Witcher series reveals a lot about the state of the industry. Larian gives the big names like Bethesda or Bioware a run for their money with this masterpiece. In closing: My characters girlfriend, a demon-posessed bard that turned into a demon hunter once I helped her purge the demon from her soul played a heartfelt song (Yes, they recorded it) in front of the throne of the last living god. Can't recommend enough.","September 25, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

For 33 USD (For the deluxe edition), this game offers a lot more than most AAA titles in the past months, or even years. This review is here to hopefully show you how much you NEED this game. (Note: Not all the games content is able to fit into one review, so I will try to keep this as short as possible.) DIVINITY: ORIGINAL SIN 2 Review (Spoilers Ahead) Story: I have played a few modern RPGs in my life. Mass Effect, Dragon Age, SWOTR, Skyrim, Fallout, Phantasy Star, Final Fantasy, but none of them really hold a candle to how much content and diversity this game contains. The story itself is continued after the events of Original Sin, but taake place hundreds of years after, meaning that there is no need to play the original to know what happens here. You play as a Sourcerer, a being able to tap into the misterious Source to use powers that are deemed too dangerous for the public. I won't go too in detail on that, but from there, your journey begins. When I say ""your"" I don't really mean JUST your character that you made for the game, but YOU as well. This game makes YOU an integral part of the story, not just your character. You can traverse the world and do whatever you want. The best part of the story is that it is non-linear. Hell, the entire game isn't linear, but I'll get to that. Any and EVERY choice that you make has an impact on, not just the story itself, but the lives of everybody around you, and it shows. The story can be played hundreds of times and still feel fresh. Different ""tags"" that you get/use (talked about in character customization) allow you to interact with people differently. What race you choose also makes a huge impact on how characters interact with you. In this game, there are 6 different ""origin characters"" that allow you to experience their story through their point of view. I haven't done this myself (having only 38 hours into the game at the time of this review) but it is interesting to see the world through their eyes. If you don't want to, you can always use your own character and recruit them as ""allies."" Note that in this game, your companions stories play out alongside yours. Choices will have to be made. Thats all I'm saying about that. This game also allows for friends to enter your game alongside you. Many different things can happen, and you may end up fighting each other if you decide against it. Quests can be found anywhere, especially NPC's. Depending on your choices however, they may be harsher to you, or maybe even not give you the quest in the first place. Character Customizations: This is arguably the least amazing thing in the game, which is saying something because it is still better than most other RPG creation systems. You can customize anything from a persons style, to their tags (which are sort of like occupations, which affect the story and dialogue.) It is here that you can also choose what class you are going to be. I won't go into too much detail, but know that choosing a class doesn't mean that you stay that class forever. You can spec your character into whatever class you want. One should note however that your beginning weapon is determined by your class. You can also choose your atributes and skills in this section. Note that these affect your beginning character, and possibly your end game character if you stay on the road that you started. Combat: The flexibility of the story applies to combat as well. There are dmany different skills that you can choose from, which can be learned using books. Note that it is impossible to learn a skill if you don't have the right stats for it. There are many different ways a battle can go.. especially since the AI is good on higher difficulties. There are different elements that can be used to your advantage. These elements give different debuffs to your oponents, but not all of them are effective as there are resistances. With the introduction of Divinity Original Sin 2 comes armor. These values are found on top of the health bar, and they serve the purpose of negating any and all debuffs, so you need to take care of that first. In this game, you might notice some elements on the ground. If you happen to hit it either with a skill or basic attack, it turns into something different. For example, if an enemy is standing on a pudddle, you can use an electricity skill to stun them and cause them to lose a turn. Or, if they are standing on oil, using fire would cause an explosion, dealing damage as well as DOT. The possibilities are endless. The only limit to combat is how many action points you have. This can be increased with the use of armor and skills, but I won't get too into that. Music/Voice Acting: For a game that almost didn't have voice acting, it is done pretty damn well. Every character is fully voiced. With a certain perk that even allows you to talk to and get quests from animals. Its 100% amazing. Over 1,000,000 lines of dialogue was recorded for this game, and each one really pushes the game along The music is superb. Both thematic and atmospheric, it really helps immerse you in the world of Divinity. You can even choose which of 4 instruments will be playing during the game. It is amazing. Mods and Downloads: Aside from all of this content, Larian has decided that this game needed mods. They also allowed players to make their own stories using the ingame assets, which, for a 33 dollar game is astounding. While I would say that mods and downloads aren't NEEDED for the game to be amazing, it really adds to the replayability of the game as a whole. Note that using mods will disable achievements for the game, so you achievement hunters out there will need to play without them. Multiplayer: Sometimes, it gets a little lonely, so playing with friends is an option, and in my opinion, a MUST TRY. You can play with up to 4 players online, and 2 on split screen (YES THERE IS SPLITSCREEN.) They can help you do many things... of which I shouldn't spoil. You can even sabotage them when fighting, and you can even initiate PVP with them. Speaking of PVP, there is a designated area for such, where you team up with others in order for you to kill your oponents. I haven't played the game mode myself, but it does look fun. Closing Thoughts: BUY THIS ALREADY.","December 3, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

642,"Being born in 1990 with an older brother, I watched him play/stumbled through the Baldur's Gate series growing up. Divinity Original Sin 2 is what I imagine someone old enough at the time to appreciate those games felt. It is simply amazing - the amount of freedom you have, the lack of hand holding, the extremely deep and satisfying combat, and the fully and impressive voice acted conversations make this game worth the $59.99 of a triple A game. But this is not a triple A game, this is most obviously a game built from passion. It blows my mind that games of this quality and quantity (I'm 27 hours in and am not even off the first island, who know how much more gameplay there is) can exist and ask for $44.99 and not be on the front of every gaming website, while these triple A titles asking $60 chocked full of micro transactions are selling copies by the millions. To Larian Studios, thank you for making this game. It is going to go down in history of one of my favorite games.","September 21, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

649,EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I never played the 1st but damn this game is amazing. It is what Diablo 3 should have been in my opinion. You can do so many things you can't do in other games my fovorite thing I found out was you can pick ANYTHING UP. I didn't have a lockpick so I picked the chest itself up til I had one and then opened it later. Any NPC can trade with you but some won't take your garbage for their gold which is funny and kinda a nice change. I highly encourage everybody to get the game when it comes out 100% it will be epic and all voice acted. I hope they pick a good narrarator or that system will flop but the level of detail and care in everything I think we don't need to worry.,"September 10, 2017",4 people found this review helpful

657,"il gioco è altamente consigliabile, anche se ha vari punti che lo rendono meno appetibile del suo predecessore. Una volta abbandonato fort joy col tuo party, quel party ti rimane. gli altri personaggi non scelti vengono eliminati o comunque non sono recrutabili. Male a mio avviso, nel capitolo precedente potevo completare le storie di tutti i personaggi , qui no. Questo limita anche il volere creare un personaggio del tutto nuovo nuovo. se i personaggi principali della storia sono 6, e il party contiene al max 4 pg, se creo un personaggio ex novo non potrò vedere la storia di ben 3 personaggi principali. vale la pena quindi usare i personaggi ""prefabbricati"". grave mancanza a mio parere, se lo fanno per farmelo giocare più volte , per me non ha comunque senso. La trama PRINCIPALE non è all altezza del gioco. è piuttosto banale anzi, anche questa mancanza grave, che sposta gli equilibri da ""capolavoro"" a ""ottimo gioco"". poca roba direte voi, ottimo è ottimo. NO, perchè capolavoro è capolavoro. L'inglese utilzzato con alcuni termini ""arcaici"" e la mole mastodontica di dialoghi con cui ci si scontra rendono il gioco faticoso anche per chi conosce l'inglese, si rischia di perdere parte della storia , se gioco per 3/4 ore e devo mettermi a leggere e tradurre tutto quello che c'è scritto, di quelle 3/4 ore ne perdo almeno una, una e mezza. Ovvio che alla lunga viene da saltare alcuni di questi dialoghi, e rischi di trovarti a non capire il proseguimento della trama. Il gioco è comunque molto consigliabile, ma gli autori si sono un po fatti prendere la mano, hanno aggiunto tanta carne al fuoco, troppa, per me, rendendo il gioco faticoso da finire, un po come se tu fossi a una grigliata di carne buonissima, ma ce n'è talmente tanta che ti costringi a finirla, non per fame ma perchè non vuoi sprecarne, ma alla fine ti senti un pò stomacato e forzato.","July 10, 2017",5 people found this review helpful

662,"Update 2: The game released 5 days ago, And since then, I've put 75 hours in, and I'm still not finished with the main campaign. The game, upon release looks and feels incredible, and yes - there are a few bugs, but with how immense this game is, it's really nothing I wasn't expecting. ALL of my previous ""Cons"" have been resolved as of release. There is legitimately nothing bad I can say about this game, it is one of the best games I've ever played, It's equal to (and sometimes greater than) Witcher 3 in almost every respect. This game is one we will be talking about for years to come, it's an instant classic, and if have even the slightest enjoyment in tactical combat and deep RPG gameplay, this game is for you. That's all i'm going to write for now, I have more of Rivellon to explore! Update 1: It took me approximately 30 hours to finish the entirety of the first act (Note: I left some side-quests unfinished, and this involved few deaths.) My pros and cons remain unchanged, but i would like to throw out some more things i noticed. This game has more challenging combat that D:OS EE, I found that even on the ""Classic"" difficulty, the combat encounters were on-par with (If not slightly easier) than playing on tactician mode of D:OS EE. If you thought D:OS was too easy, this game improves on that quite a bit. This game also has more decisions for your character to make, and even this early in EA you can see where they intend to take things. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 22 Hours in, still not finished with the first act, this game was worth the purchase even during Early Access. Pros: * Polished Feel * VERY descriptive dialogue * Challenging Encounters * Entertaining Spells * Divinity Game Cons: * Beginning is quite difficult, as the game doesn't explain where you should go. But this was present in D:OS Classic as well. * Leveling up doesn't feel as fun anymore, since you only get one ""Talent"" every 4 levels (This includes talents for Sneak, etc.) * Party dialogue system is unfinished (Early Access) On the whole, This game managed to pull me in just like D:OS Classic, and i look forward to many more hours in rivellon.","January 9, 2017","5 people found this review helpful

664,"The story and mood of the game, while a step up from the first, quickly starts to fall apart the further you get into it. The disjointed nature of the story really hurts the game, despite having such a strong start with Fort Joy, which was easily ten times better than Cyseal (though it lacked the same charm). The dual dialogue system being gone also means that co-op interractions have a lot less weight to them; similarly, origin characters don't really have interactions with each other, which really brings the experience down at times. The disjointed story becomes especially apparent The biggest problem with this game is that combat scenarios are far too similar to one another, thanks to the armor system. Unlike the first game, crowd control and status effects must first go through physical or magic armor, or else they are completely resisted by the target. While, in the beginning, it seemed like a nice solution to fix the problem the first game had, where you could CC targets one after the other and just wail on them for free, the armor system REALLY hurts the point of elemental surfaces and the like. Outside of Fort Joy, I found no use for them; everything just had too much armor for anything to work. Your strongest abilities were the only thing that did much of anything, and if you were a magic user, using a staff for damage was awful as wands were a lot stronger. Skills, stats and talents are all pretty homogenized in the game. Strength, finesse, and intelligence are all ""more damage"". Memory gives you more slots for more abilities, and wits gives you more crit chance and lets you detect treasures (you can supplement this for a wits potion or the clear minded ability, since the amount of wits you need to detect stuff is pretty low). For melee builds, Necromancer is almost a must, because the health returns and utility of many necromancer abilities are irreplacable. For any character, though, being a hybrid (unless you are just a full mage) is a must because many abilities in each magic tree do not rely on intelligence to be useful. It lets your characters have much more access to abilities outside of Warfare, Scoundrel, and Huntsman, but some just aren't good or don't really add much in the way of variety, except for Necromancer. Civil abilities vary in their usefulness, but one that I found particularly vexing was persuasion. Sometimes, you can't really control who an NPC talks to during certain events, and if you lack persuasion, you may end up missing out on certain events. Some dialogues have stat checks, but they still require persuasion to do anything. I suppose I was expecting it to be like an Obsidian RPG in that regard. Overall, I think Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a step back to a degree. I don't neccessarily not recommend it (but I can't write a mixed review yet...) but I really feel like its lacking in a lot of areas. The story can't be helped, though its still better than the first game, but a lot of this stuff could probably be fixed in an inevitable Enhanced Edition, which I feel like this game sorely needs. Its still a game worth its asking price, and if you are looking for a good co-op RPG, this is the best one out right now.","October 8, 2017","69 people found this review helpful

665,"I really wish that Steam allowed us to rate games on a 1-10 scale rather than a pure thumbs up, thumbs down rating. I spent a lot of hours on this game, but I didn't finish it. To me that's the ultimate cut off, if I grow tired of a game before actually completing it, I'm giving it a thumbs down. I enjoyed Divinity 1 (and played the original Divine Divinity) so expected to like this game. There were some improvements over Divinity 1. The inventory system is more streamlined, you can look at all of your character's inventories in one big screen instead of having to swap between characters. In addition, you can use an item or equip an item with any character from any inventory. I also somewhat liked the storylines of the pregenerated characters better than in Divinity 1. But honestly, other than that, I liked the first game much better. Both games have an issue (at least this is a problem for me - others might not be bothered as much by it) that if you go the ""wrong direction"" you end up facing enemies that are too hard. In several areas you end up having to test out different battles to see if they are doable at your level. I have mixed feelings about this - it makes levelling feel meaningful but something like this feels more in line with a dark souls game than more of a standard RPG. I don't particularly enjoy having to go back and see if I can do a fight yet 3 or 4 different times as I level up. But as to specifics about Divinity 2 - to touch on my last point, the areas felt really unbalanced. As I mentioned already, you have to test out battles in some areas to see if you can do them yet, In others, not so much. For example, Act II for me was a constant situation of trying to find the one area I could actually make progress on, since everything else was too hard. Then Act III wasn't a problem at all, I never ran into a fight I couldn't handle. Then Act IV (and this is the point that I just lost interest) there's a part where you get ambushed in several different spots by monsters that are higher level than my level as well as the level of everything else in the area. Keep in mind I'd been attempting to complete every quest along the way, so I should have been at least close to the highest level I could have been at by that point. I was also playing on normal difficulty and have a lot of experience playing these kinds of games (I know how to use terrain, split party, etc..). I also disliked the change in how skills work from Divinity 1 to Divinity 2. Divinity 1 had a Novice/Adept/Master system for learning skills. Once raised your skill level to a certain point you could learn a certain amount of skills from each tier. The higher level skills also had level reqs and had long cooldowns. Divinity 2 changes all of that. Instead it uses source points which are kind of like non regenerating mana points. Starting with the mid level skills, all of the powerful skills require source points to cast, some as many as 3 points. From a RPG standpoint that does make sense that as a Sourcerer you would need Source points to cast skills - however as a game mechanic I found it to be really annoying. After each combat you basically have to either travel back to a place where you can refill Source, or cast a spell multiple times with each character out of combat to regain these points so that you can keep using these skills. *And* in many cases these are the exact same skills (Arrow Spray for example) from Divinity 1 that didn't require Source then and in fact were used by your characters in that game who were Source HUNTERS - so after even a bit of thought, the whole concept that they are Sourcerer skills kind of falls apart. The Divinity games utilize elemental combinations to create effects (fire, freezing, electricity, etc..) in combat. Divinity 1 did a good job of this but this is another area in which Divinity 2 changed things for the worse in my opinion. Div 1 had a good amount of abilities that caused elemental effects but it wasn't everything and it was relatively controllable. Div 2 has so much that quite literally after almost every combat the entire area is just a giant lake of cursed fire. It's not so much that this is deadly it's just not as clean of a system as in 1 where you could set certain areas on fire in a more controlled way. In that game for example, you could create an area where enemies would have to cross that would quite often significantly damage them before they got to you. This game, perhaps because it's so easy to just set everything on fire, the actual fire damage doesn't really feel significant and really makes the whole thing kind of pointless. This game also introduces Magical and Physical Armor to the health system. Basically each character and enemy has a certain amount of Magical and/or Physical armor. Most attacks are considered one or the other type and will hit that type of armor first before they will damage the health of the target. There are two reasons why I found this system to really not be an improvement. First, a standard party will have a mix of damage. I had a tank/melee fighter, a ranger and 2 wizards. The wizards did almost exclusively magic damage and the other 2 did almost exclusively physical damage. Most enemies have both physical and magical armor. This creates a situation where you are almost always having to knock out *both* types of armor on enemies, or you have to split your damage to 2 different enemies which means you can't focus down anyone very fast. In addition to this, almost all secondary effects (knockdown, stun, charm. etc..) don't work at all until you've broken through the type of armor that blocks them. This made those effects much less useful than in Divinity 1 where you could immediately crowd control someone in a tough battle. In Divinity 2 since you have to break through the armor first, by the point where you could CC someone, it's often almost as easy to just finish them off. Making that whole aspect of combat (which was a big part of the first game) much less useful. In the end, I got tired of continually having to reload because I stumbled upon something thrown in my path that was too hard, bored by the inability to use skills without having to constantly refill my source points and just lost interest overall. I'm sure plenty of other people who aren't bothered as much by these mechanics would enjoy this game, but it wasn't for me.",February 24,"132 people found this review helpful

666,"Great story. Great writing. Characters are interesting. Manages to fit moments of levity and comedy into a serious, grim narrative. Exploring the world is immersive and makes use of your characters' skills. Your guy who can grow wings and fly around the battlefield can do this just as easily out of combat. Leads to feeling free when exploring around. Ever play an rpg where you wonder why your party sits and listens to the villain monologue and then lets him take the first shot? You can do that, or you can shoot first. You can shoot (almost) anyone first. You monster. Combat is turn based and you can pull off some fairly genius moves, cheese tactics, and many things in between. The fights get a little bonkers towards the end, but it's not intolerable. And mods. Lots of mods already with more to come, I suspect.","October 6, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
667,"I played the original and I thoroughly enjoyed it, This is a genuinely excellent sequel. Every system has been improved upon and it's as quirky as ever. Multiplayer has been improved upon at every level, I love the 'competitive"" aspect. The only real negative I can think of is it still has a few glaring bugs that can lock off a couple of quest lines (only a couple of quests out of literally hundreds).","November 27, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

670,"This is one of those RPGs that takes the ""Role-Playing"" part seriously. There are so many options to personalize your playthrough that it makes me want to play it 3-4 more times just to see everything. The preset characters are all unique and well developed, each of which come with an extremely intruiging personal questline. The story is easily one of its biggest strengths, as it kept me entralled throughout the entire experience. Another strength of the game is the gameplay itself. The mechanics of the game help build depth both inside and outside of combat. The combat itself is extremely well executed, with battles that can last for over 30 minutes and still be interesting until the very end. This is easily one of the best RPGs to come out in a long time. A must buy for any RPG fan.","October 28, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

It has its hillarious moment, nice and likeable characters, the combat is excellent and great to combine with the environment, tons of spells and skills to smash, freeze, break and bleed your opponents with! An elf licking your arm! Villains you just gotta hate and a story that really captivated me from the beginning until the end.

674,"At first i was quite apprehensive, i played the game at a friends house in beta and i did not like the direction the game was going at first. The original armor system was akin to mass effect 2 and it felt very rock paper scissors like .... Thanksfully shy of release they made a drastic change in how armor works and he new system is quite refreshing and i like it. the addition of a band of characters who are not blank slates while still being customizable for how you mechnically want to play the game was freaking brilliant. I love specifically Fane and Lfan the most but all of the characters are this fantastic dichotomy of being terrible people yet relatable people that seem like thier actions are primarily tainted by being on the wrong side of a ""very bad day"". i think they did aslightly better job of making it somewhat apparent where and what you needed to do from the get go and the ""tutorial"" section on the ship is great, playing throught the turtorial is drastically better than a pile of exposition to tell you how to play an RPG from the ground up. Im not 100% sold on the new skill system as better, but it certainly is fluid and doent punish you as harshly for side speccing, i also like that crafting does not require skill investment and that the ""Civil"" skills have been split off so you dont have to try to choose between skewering harder or not sounding like a neanderthal in conversation. I do however wish crafting seemed more impactful at low levels .... custom crafting your weapons and getting ahead of the curve through exploration theft and smart trading was quite fun in OS1. i find that somewhat removed in OS2 and most crafting early game is primarily for ""consumables"" and the customization of old on your own crafted weapons seems somewhat limited (using essences to add a damage type) the introduction of more playable character races is a welcome change and the tag system really amps up the replayability to 11. I definitely agree with the sentiment its one of the best game sof the year quite possibly the best yet.","October 10, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

676,"Did you ever love playing a tabletop RPG (DnD, DCC, MCC, etc) but the logistics of getting one together was hard? Look no further adventurer, for Divinity: Original Sin 2 creates a tabletop experience right from your 'battlestation'. Naturally, the game is challenging and open, there are many options of how to play and what to do in any given scenario. Kill everybody! What the hell right, they're in your way after all right? Or, befriend as many people (monsters, creatures, and animals as well) as is possible! What the hell right, they're part of your adventure after all right? Dialogue is so well done in this game, so profoundly voice acted that most characters have a unique feel and attitude as well as conversation choices (often per Origin character, meaning the five Origin characters have unique interactions with the world). Character creation is fluid, meaning, at a certain point in the game you have an opportunity to re-spec each character in your campaign into a better presentation of what you wanted in the game. For example, didn't like the summoner healer and instead wanted a summoner ranger? Well, why not! Or perhaps a jack of all trades? That is probably one of the more enriching experiences of the game, feeling as though one did not ♥♥♥♥ up in terms of how they allotted skill points. One of my favorite elements is the use of surface elements (blood & water, or either electrified, ice, fire, poison, oil, and cursed ground -- you'll see that for the first time and it is an intense experience especially on harder difficulties). But beyond that, the playing with friends experience is open and ongoing. Say a friend can only hop in for a few hours on the weekend, while you've played 34 hours in 3 days? Well, they can jump into one of the characters you have, re-spec them to their liking, finish a couple quests and get out all while continuing along your level base and campaign. (and you can do the same to their campaign, should they ever make one) PROS: - Great character development and voice acting - Awesome fluidity in how to build characters - Satisfying and intense turn-based combat (on Tactician it is hard, but not impossible) - Rewarding unique playstyles without catering too much to cheese (without giving it away, the game will sometimes know if you cheese certain puzzles) - Ongoing joining/leaving process for party play with friends - Brings visualization to the tabletop experience (imo, but still) - An absolutely enormous amount of content - Challenging and fun (or frustrating and befuddling) puzzles! - Connecting the dots on quests can be sometimes misleading, meaning the player needs to actually put in the work to logically figure out what the questbook/discovered dialogue related to the quest means in order to complete it -- this is not always straightforward and direct. CONS: - There actually are some bugs, believe it or not, and because of that remember (REMEMBER!) to save OFTEN - Somewhat slow-paced (not a personal con, as tabletops are slow-paced, but I have heard this be a turn off so I include it) - Some quests are easy to miss or hard to figure out due to the last point on PROS, (not a personal con, but it is something that may frustrate people who aren't used to having the game hold their hand through exploration/decision making related to important quests) tl;dr: great open RPG with turn-based combat akin to tabletop gaming, think outside the box and be rewarded, discover more about the characters and races and be rewarded (or disgusted). Combat is wonderful, albeit tricky, and full of dazzling experiences. Great for picking up and leaving off with friends who have busy or demanding schedules. If you're a fan of turn-based RPGs then give this one a go on sale, or if you're a die-hard tabletop RPG person pick it up when you can. If you have friends you can convince to play this with you, do that, probably one of the best buddy-gaming experiences I have had in a great while.","September 25, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
677,"I've been against Turn Based RPG's for a long time, cause most of them seem to follow suit with the same fights over and over and lack any real challenge. This however brings so much strategy to the table where you actually feel guilty when you lose, as if it is your fault, because mostly it is. This is how games are supposed to be, challenge and reward, not grind grind grind reward. Its interactive and makes me pine for KotoR clone in this style. You can literally cast invisibility on a patch of ice, and the enemy will run across it and slip, thats how complex this is.

700,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Even now in Early Access, this game is both beautiful, as well as beautifully complex and challenging; compared to the first installment, D:OS 2 takes all the strengths of its predecessor and builds on the weaknesses -- we now have Origin Characters with their own backstories on top of optionally completely custom characters, and not just these Origin Character's individual stories, but also the main, overarching story has received much more attention and love than in the first game. We can also choose between the races of Human, Lizard, Elves, Dwarfs and, my personal favorite, the Undead; whatever you choose, rest assured that even just your race will have an effect on how you're viewed and treated in the world of D:OS 2. On top of all of this, Larian has even dared to go completely beyond the conventional by implementing a fully-fledged Game Master Mode -- a feature which to me is extremely interesting, allowing up to five players to enjoy customly created campaigns as a group of up to four adventurers and one Game Master, to create the virtual equivalent of the good old Pen & Paper roleplaying experience. All in all, this has every chance of becoming not just the best RPG of this year, but also one of the best RPGs period.","August 20, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
701,"Loved the first game, despite its flaws. I feel like this game fixes every issue the first game had and across the board improves on it - my hat off to Larian Studios for listening to feedback. While the story and setting is darker, there is so much humor sprinkled into this game. With the addition of voice acting, I find myself listening to everything. I didn't know how to feel about the narration at first, but it has grown on me and I feel like it's a great addition to the game. The Origin stories are a neat touch, I am doing my first playthrough as Lohse and I feel like mine is the most interesting of the group. Definitely want to try Fane next. Overall, its a beautiful game with great little details hidden everywhere. (Also the music is great) I have a hard time coming up with any real criticisms of the game, but I will try. I wish there was a better loot system - i play ranged and I just never get to loot anything, which isn't very fun. Some of the quests I've run into were bugged, so that's a bummer but I'm sure they'll be fixed in the near future and I can do them on my Tactician playthrough. I feel like playing with 4 people pulls the game into too many directions, I miss stuff that other people are doing and everyone wants to have the feeling of exploration - that's not really a game flaw, I just think it'd be a better experience with 1-2 players.","September 25, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
702,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 - 2017 GEM. Finding a game that mixes RPG, D&D, customizable class/ characters, good story telling, beautiful aesthetics, crafting system, tactical turn based battle, and option to play co-op? This game pretty much offers it all up on a silver plate. I've played the first Divinity Original Sin, and my impression of that wasn't so strong, however I decided to give this a try, and it definitely floored me. None too many games I've played have done a swell job in buffing lores, stories, and open ended quests for you to explore. You don't have to be a lore-lover or a rouge type gamer to enjoy this. There's a sweet spot for everyone. I went looking for a plain old adventure-with-consequences game, and spent more time reading up short lores here and there instead of speeding through it. I can't believe I've spent 80+ hours (solo play) and still haven't completed it yet. Actually for the first chapter, I managed to spend 8-9 hours (and this was just purely exploring and figuring out quests). Halfway through the game, it even conjured up my nostalgia for Dragon Age 1. CONS/ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT: -Sometimes there are NO warnings before huge consequences take place. And when it happens, it's too late to alter (unless you are bothered to load up a game save 1 hour ago+). This happened a few times for me, the most painful one for me being: I couldn't take my companions to the next chapter because I'd missed that one window to convince them. They were absolutely gone. I loaded a previous save, but ever since that happened, I ended up tracking quests on wikia instead in fear of a major slip up -Quest journals are sometimes vague, and you will be left wondering or wiki-ing what the next step should be -Some quests feel un-finished or un-polished, as there may only be ONE, OBSCURE way of completing it -Not a must, but nice to have: Camera angle needs more rotation flexibility -No option to hide the HUD PROS: -The battle system constantly makes you look for the best spots to prepare and engage. Whenever you think you've got your ""go-to"" strategies nailed down, the game manages to switch it up just a little to make it challenging (+fun) again -Attention to detail towards the environment and the overall atmosphere. I don't always stop and look at the shadows of leaves and trees in a game. Each chapter is a map with it's own characteristics -Memorable background sound and music <3 Well done Borislav Slavov -EVERY character has a voice! And voice acting is just ace -Main companions have decent back stories, although 1 or 2 still seem like pompous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s after 20 hours -HIGH replayability value -Co-op offers extra fun if you want play with you rmates, and most things work smoothly. Just take note of the connectivity menu, and make sure to set your game privacy, as random people can enter your game and hijack your acharacter completely. -Dungeon master mode! For those who are into D&D this might be an interesting mode to check out TO THINK THIS GAME WAS BACKED BY A KICK STARTER AND DEVELOPED + LAUNCHED UNDER 3 YEARS! It's not easy balancing and taking in multiple opinions and ideas and delivering on something this decent. I suspect good team work somewhere in Larian Studios. The game is decent enough for me to overlook the annoying flaws (for now). And major game developing companies? You guys better brush up your A game. Top notch graphics aren't the only thing that makes a game immersive and great. ANYWAYS...JUST...Just ..go play it!","October 5, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

707,"Bang up ♥♥♥♥ing game. Seriously, best RPG in many, MANY years. I haven't ever really reviewed a game before, so I'm going to give it my best shot. This game is about as close to DND on a digital medium that you can get while still being its own game. Fully interactive environment, (tons of fire, electricuting water, exploding oil and poison) and the developers really played with it. Just a small spoiler alert, but to just put it in perspective how the environment comes into play. There's one fight pretty far into the game on top of a mountain of wreckage. Out of absolutely nowhere, tons of oily blobs come to kill you. Every time you damage them, and they move, they spread oil. So the whole time, you're trying to batter them down as you move up the mountain to get away from them. The dev's then have it to where when the oily guys finally go down, TONS of fire guys show up and ignite all the oil. I know its kinda hard to get it across, but fighting ontop of this giant mound with fire everywhere trying to batter down the fiery slimes, seriously felt cool. Character creation wise, I mean it's pretty good. Not a ton of customization, just standard face 1, 2, 3, etc. But honestly not a big deal. As you develop what your character is good at, you grow to love em. Classes are pointless, you build your character the way YOU want to, so they can literally become anything. I've got a few characters going, and all feel super unique and diverse. A dwarven rogue shapeshifter who can grow a tentacle arm and smack people around as well as shed all enemies magical resistances to support, I've got a fire slinging geomancer who uses oil♥♥♥♥♥♥to explode just about everyone, and I've got a necromancer archer who summons tons of undead corpses to explode all over people. It all feels super unique and fun to play. There's times where I miss my other characters, hop on them to play, and then miss the one I was just playing. Kinda neat. If you want my advice, 100+ hours advice, PLAY WITH FRIENDS. Preferrably in person. Hit up an old school lan party feel, bring cpu's over, build a SUPER diverse cast of characters, and hunker down. Pizza and beer obviously. Plan for an all nighter, because I literally PROMISE you you'll be playing til 6am EASY. I haven't personally had a game grab me like that in many years, and god damn its a good feeling to have back. Go larian, you guys are the men and women making games great again. 10/10.","October 4, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

709,"I mean you can transform even the strongest enemy into a chicken!Do i have to say more?If you like D&D this is a game for you,especially for the pen&paper D&D fans.The freedom and the mechanics of this game is the closest thing to D&D.Do you like to have half of your party fighting monsters and the other half trying to steal every single trader in a town or have them fool around like getting drunk in a pub,you can do that!Do you want to make your tank character into the most dangerous necromancer that would make even the Lich King proud?you can do that.You can even distract a rich trader with one character by talking to them and the rest of the crew can steal everything from them,im talking about the heist of your life here.But be aware,if you are new to this game like me,you gonna reload many times in most of the battles.Cause even in normal mode the enemies would give you hard time if you just rush in,in every battle without thinking of a strategy.And also remember every quest can go smooth without even breaking a sweat if you thinking smart or you gonna have a hell of time trying to survive the battle.And as a player with 50+ hours some tips for new players 1.Dont forget to get the bedroll at the start of the game,there is a bedroll somewhere inside the ship take,it and use it after battles if you need replenish health it has inifinite uses.2 dont waste gold on resurrection scrolls,you gonna find plenty in Act 2 or you gonna have enough gold to buy more.And last but not least tip,if you wanna keep all your party members after act 1,make sure you have them chainlinked and fight together in the last part of Act 1.(i found out this in the hard way).Enjoy!",April 25,2 people found this review helpful

712,"Have yet to finish the game , only played it in release (2 hours in ea). And i am 100 % sold. I found the first to be very strict to what you should do (and in what order) but gave no hints. This time it offers larger freedom and some hints (but it dosent take away that part of figuring something out). The classes and skills are really fun and the combat is enjoyable. But the big seller is the story and the characters and events that the devs has put into this game. Amazing !

713,"I almost never write reviews, but even in the few 12 hours that I've played (which has only felt like 2-3 hours) this game has shown to be a true master class in the RPG genre. Imagine D&D with one of the best story-telling and smart dungeon masters, and that is the feel of this game. Combat is incredibly in depth and tactical, hard modes require grinding and ingenuity. Sound design, voice work, character designs, class systems are all next level. If you're looking for constant action this might not be the game for you, but if you want to be absorbed into a world, experience an incredibly rewarding feeling when finally beating a fight, and spend hours exploring and shooting off on side quests this is the game for you. Lovers of RPG's this is a must buy.","September 23, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
714,Game of the Year 2017 hands down. Immersive and beautiful surroundings to match the most wonderful of stories. The voice acting is some of the best done and the conversation options are unique with each person or thing you come to meet. Combat is fluid and fun with reactive environments and many skills and character builds to choose from. The multiplayer experience is even more entertaining because of the environmental effects that can take place on a battlefield. Freeze your friends and enemies for that extra adrenaline rush. 10/10 would recommend to any RPG fan.,"September 26, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

717,"Did you ever love playing a tabletop RPG (DnD, DCC, MCC, etc) but the logistics of getting one together was hard? Look no further adventurer, for Divinity: Original Sin 2 creates a tabletop experience right from your 'battlestation'. Naturally, the game is challenging and open, there are many options of how to play and what to do in any given scenario. Kill everybody! What the hell right, they're in your way after all right? Or, befriend as many people (monsters, creatures, and animals as well) as is possible! What the hell right, they're part of your adventure after all right? Dialogue is so well done in this game, so profoundly voice acted that most characters have a unique feel and attitude as well as conversation choices (often per Origin character, meaning the five Origin characters have unique interactions with the world). Character creation is fluid, meaning, at a certain point in the game you have an opportunity to re-spec each character in your campaign into a better presentation of what you wanted in the game. For example, didn't like the summoner healer and instead wanted a summoner ranger? Well, why not! Or perhaps a jack of all trades? That is probably one of the more enriching experiences of the game, feeling as though one did not ♥♥♥♥ up in terms of how they allotted skill points. One of my favorite elements is the use of surface elements (blood & water, or either electrified, ice, fire, poison, oil, and cursed ground -- you'll see that for the first time and it is an intense experience especially on harder difficulties). But beyond that, the playing with friends experience is open and ongoing. Say a friend can only hop in for a few hours on the weekend, while you've played 34 hours in 3 days? Well, they can jump into one of the characters you have, re-spec them to their liking, finish a couple quests and get out all while continuing along your level base and campaign. (and you can do the same to their campaign, should they ever make one) PROS: - Great character development and voice acting - Awesome fluidity in how to build characters - Satisfying and intense turn-based combat (on Tactician it is hard, but not impossible) - Rewarding unique playstyles without catering too much to cheese (without giving it away, the game will sometimes know if you cheese certain puzzles) - Ongoing joining/leaving process for party play with friends - Brings visualization to the tabletop experience (imo, but still) - An absolutely enormous amount of content - Challenging and fun (or frustrating and befuddling) puzzles! - Connecting the dots on quests can be sometimes misleading, meaning the player needs to actually put in the work to logically figure out what the questbook/discovered dialogue related to the quest means in order to complete it -- this is not always straightforward and direct. CONS: - There actually are some bugs, believe it or not, and because of that remember (REMEMBER!) to save OFTEN - Somewhat slow-paced (not a personal con, as tabletops are slow-paced, but I have heard this be a turn off so I include it) - Some quests are easy to miss or hard to figure out due to the last point on PROS, (not a personal con, but it is something that may frustrate people who aren't used to having the game hold their hand through exploration/decision making related to important quests) tl;dr: great open RPG with turn-based combat akin to tabletop gaming, think outside the box and be rewarded, discover more about the characters and races and be rewarded (or disgusted). Combat is wonderful, albeit tricky, and full of dazzling experiences. Great for picking up and leaving off with friends who have busy or demanding schedules. If you're a fan of turn-based RPGs then give this one a go on sale, or if you're a die-hard tabletop RPG person pick it up when you can. If you have friends you can convince to play this with you, do that, probably one of the best buddy-gaming experiences I have had in a great while.","September 25, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
718,"I've been against Turn Based RPG's for a long time, cause most of them seem to follow suit with the same fights over and over and lack any real challenge. This however brings so much strategy to the table where you actually feel guilty when you lose, as if it is your fault, because mostly it is. This is how games are supposed to be, challenge and reward, not grind grind grind reward. Its interactive and makes me pine for KotoR clone in this style. You can literally cast invisibility on a patch of ice, and the enemy will run across it and slip, thats how complex this is. Prepare to make lots of mistakes and ingenius decisions.",January 5,2 people found this review helpful
719,"Finally beat my first walkthrough, and I can say with the upmost excitement I am ready to start my second. The feels and sense of pride and accomplishment you get at the end is like no other. The campaign was arguably the best 70 hours of my life and I enjoyed every second of discovery, storytelling, and loading saves. It is so rich and detailed and I would recommend this as Game of the Year, as you are getting a campaign, single player or co-op and arena mode as well as the gamemaster mode, which is Dungeons and Dragons, for $45. Easily over 250 hours of gameplay, and it just keeps getting better. Every triple A developer should take note- this is what the industry needs. I haven't been so enticed and enchanted by a video game in many, many, many years. I can say, after much consideration and time spent thinking about this game, it is my favorite game of all-time. And that title doesn't come very easily. Job well done Larian Studios. Job well done.","December 5, 2017","2 people found this review helpful

723,"At the risk of heaping too much praise on the game despite not even having left the initial Fort Joy area, it's bloody marvellous. There are so many paths to take in the story and each NPC interaction feels unique. I'm playing 2 mutliplayer games in parallel, with different characters, and it's played out differently in both cases because of different starting variables and events, along with different player actions. It's really great. BTW, it's not like we haven't escaped Fort Joy because we don't know how to - oh no, we could have escaped at multiple moment, but we chose to stay. Partly to XP farm, partly because there's just so much to do! Moreover, it addresses the issue i usually have with games that have level systems and loot - the weapons scale with your attributes, and higher level gear can be equipped if you have the appropriate attributes. So for example, if you're playing a melee build and have the appropriate Strength, you can equip level 4 armour while being level 3. Combat is pretty fun if you're into turn-based stuff. Think ""new XCOM but with Action Points"", but perhaps more chaotic and varied. Spread some oil, set it ablaze. Then chuck poison in it to watch it go boom! Or the other way around.There are pre-defined classes but you can tweak them as you like, and respec any time. I haven't even got to the point where I can use Source abilities yet. Crafting seems pretty complex, but it's really cool. Find a stick, some rope and a knife - you now have a knife-on-a-stick and can use it as a sword. Find a stick and a large sea shell, you now have a magic staff. Have a potion flask and a poison barrel? Well, now you have a poison flask. Why'd you need a poison flask? Because Undead heal with poison (and get damaged by health/vitality potions). Anyway, it's an exceptionally well made game. Runs pretty smooth for me at pretty high settings (can't remember, i think it just set itself to ultra, and i didn't have to tamper with the settings) @ 1080p with a i5-3570K, GTX 670 and 8GB of RAM. Haven't encountered any bugs yet. Let that sink in. A game bought 3 months after release, in 2017, has not had a single bug so far, in 20 hours of play.

732,"This is the best game I've had the pleasure of playing (and backing) since the witcher 3. Easily my game of the year. I highly suggest you play coop because the dimension it adds to the game is so much fun as you and friend(s) just run into all the quirks and silliness. Every fight can be one if you just switch it up and try out new tactics.. or just get lucky! The amount of details and love put into this game makes AAA companies look like indie developers. The game is not without its flaws, the crafting is shallower than it can be, some armors/weapons never would have a use in someone who wants to win, misclicking on things in battle can really mess up a long fight and turn the tide negatively and the rest is mainly just nit-picky stuff. Overall this game is a solid product, it looks nice, it plays nice and its completely mastered the art of an rpg in a sandboxm, meaning you have rules and tools, but you can often abuse or mess around and accomplish things in interesting ways. This game is worth the cover charge and should be a no-brainer if you are on the fence and it is on sale!","October 8, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

The things happening in this game are so well written, exquisitly described, the love scenes are just amazing to read. And you will hate, you will hate a lot of characters and you will wait hours and hours to be finally able to fight them and it will feel like revenge. You will curse in front of your PC, ♥♥♥♥ you! die! eat this you piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ BURN! Yeah, it is like that. Its an emotional game, talk to your characters, love them, hate them, see them evolve. You will not believe the skill progress in this game, what you can become during this game... it will be sutil, slow, but at some point it you will realize how terrifyingly powerful you are. And it feels good. And the game is still hard, battles are long and tactical. You can still die, but damn you can put up a fight. And the ending... amazing, Its very satisfying. You will not be dissapointed. It has its bugs and some uncompleted quests but nothing serious. Enjoy amazing writing, amazing story, and amazing characters. It ended and all i have is an aplause. This is how its done. This is a game for those times when you feel like diving into a LONG story and experience it.

734,"I have not play this kind of game for a long time, A Classic RPG that improve on everything on it genre. The Freedom is just MASSIVE!! I already builded 5 Charectors all on Classic Difficulty, A Fighter Noble Soldier who try to help everyone he can travel with Red Prince ,Lohse and Fane. A Lone Wolf Rogue who steal everyone but help those in need. A Noble Ranger Elf travel with Sebille. A Necromancer who I still don't know what to do with her. An Elf Ranger who I play Co-op with my friend. A Fighter already out of Fort joy, A Noble Ranger Elf running around try to fine everything that we can do in Fort joy. What I find is every fastified, there is at least 3 solid ways to get out of Fort Joy if you play solo[one guy in party], Fight your way out, Boat, Secret ways and if have others in party, Teleport is also an option. I didn't go far because I want to try to build a different class and see how they perform, I also wanna know what Fort Joy have to offer, and I enjoy it a lot... Bewarn This game doesn't tell you what to do, this for some are bad... but for me, I believe others will love it. Don't know what to do? Ask around and you will find interesting side quest, and some hint of something bigger outside...This make discover more reward, no quest marker to make you feel like you're stupid or lazy quest writer who don't have to write a good paragraph because quest marker already done the job. Reading also be negative for some, I'm Thai and English is my 2nd-language but still have trouble with it yet. Gameplay Combat is turnbase which sadly turn others away... But believe me...This is Deep and every fastify Turn-Base game, making combo with class build, party and your surrounding make a turnbase game yet every dynamic and good gameplay. Graphic is so beatiful, magics and skills are very well presented Sound/Audio is very well done especially theme song...I love it Performance Quite good 60+fps even thought Turnbase gameplay's FPS isn't that important... However I still got crash here and there... at 21 SEPTEMBERPatch v3.0.143.148...still crash... very annoying, please fixed your game T[]T Funny, I played Early access and it didn't crash even once. ""This is now my game of years, it's worth my money and I enjoy every moment of it"" I wanna say that but will wait till they fix the crash It's still don't stop me from playing though...

738,"Yes, I would reccomend this game. Is it the best thing since the invention of pizza since people are claiming? Not really. The Good: - Very Pretty Graphics / Reasonably optimized - Great Customization - Fully voiced, great overall quality of acting - Good world building and lore, main story can be a bit convoluted at times. - Reasonably Balanced The Bad: - I'm not very fond of a couple of combat systems. I think they have overdone the surface system. Every combat , even the tiniest ones end up a swirling chaos of destruction everywhere with burning/poison/shock/blood what have you everywhere. - Mobs instantly spawn on conveniently placed vantage points to harass you all the time. It's less about organic fights and more like forcing you to reload because you were exploring and not ready for a fight to spawn from thin air. This kinda creates the feeliing that the game is bending the rules against you, cheapening the experience overall. - Mediocre tutorial overall. Fails to tell you some key details like Lizards don't need shovels and skeletons don't need lockpicks. - Some bugs, like only half you party entering combat while the other half watches. You have to manually move your characters into combat, even though they are right there in the first place. All in all, if you're a fan of CRPGs you'll likely enjoy this as I have. but, if you're new to the genre, there are more friendly places to start.","September 18, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

746,"I have just completed this wonderful game, and am happy to conclude that this is as many have said before, one of the best RPG's ever made, I was going to gush on about the many, many things it does so well, but other people have already done that, so I'll post some personal nuggets instead. I wrote several lists of moments I'd experienced because I didn't want to forget them. This isn't something I do. Some were unexpected story twists, others were dramatic events that happened as a result of the freedom the games systems give you to tell your own story. Here's one example: I took revenge on the person who had enslaved me , by charming his bodyguards so they turned against him, I then charmed him so he fought his lackies for my pleasure. When I understood he had received the message, that he, rather than I was the slave: I poisoned him, immobilised him and finally set fire to him so I could watch him slowly die. I have never been so invested in a character's story that I'd do something like this, but this is precisely what my character would do, and it played out through gameplay.. I saved the person I had come to love from a fate worst than death, at incredible cost, and the resulting events, caused me to clap, and play sponeaneous air guitar to the musical interlude that followed... I'd like to share far more...but spoilers. Final thoughts: Incredible writing aided by a narrator which, which works wonderfully, adding a whole new level to the story. I was still finding new secrets and game play twists 250 hours in. This is a GAME. In comparison, the Witcher is a story with some light game play elements. The crafting system alone in the this game has more complexity than some entire games. The systems are rich and deep, and allow you to tell your story without cut scenes and token choices. This game makes you care about your companions, and you can change their fates in ways too numerous to mention. You may feel misty eyed when you wave your final goodbyes to them. I did. Puzzles.

750,"I have just completed this wonderful game, and am happy to conclude that this is as many have said before, one of the best RPG's ever made, I was going to gush on about the many, many things it does so well, but other people have already done that, so I'll post some personal nuggets instead. I wrote several lists of moments I'd experienced because I didn't want to forget them. This isn't something I do. Some were unexpected story twists, others were dramatic events that happened as a result of the freedom the games systems give you to tell your own story. Here's one example: I took revenge on the person who had enslaved me , by charming his bodyguards so they turned against him, I then charmed him so he fought his lackies for my pleasure. When I understood he had received the message, that he, rather than I was the slave: I poisoned him, immobilised him and finally set fire to him so I could watch him slowly die. I have never been so invested in a character's story that I'd do something like this, but this is precisely what my character would do, and it played out through gameplay.. I saved the person I had come to love from a fate worst than death, at incredible cost, and the resulting events, caused me to clap, and play sponeaneous air guitar to the musical interlude that followed... I'd like to share far more...but spoilers. Final thoughts: Incredible writing aided by a narrator which, which works wonderfully, adding a whole new level to the story. I was still finding new secrets and game play twists 250 hours in. This is a GAME. In comparison, the Witcher is a story with some light game play elements. The crafting system alone in the this game has more complexity than some entire games. The systems are rich and deep, and allow you to tell your story without cut scenes and token choices. This game makes you care about your companions, and you can change their fates in ways too numerous to mention. You may feel misty eyed when you wave your final goodbyes to them. I did. Puzzles. Remember Skyrim with it's samey symbol traps? This game has unique puzzles and traps that require brains, skill and reading to unvover. It treats the players as if they are intelligent. You will feel clever playing this game. The combat is so rich, I feel I've only scratched the surface of the abilities it gives you.

751,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I don't ever rate games, but this one really has a special place in my heart. I am in the military and far away from my 3 other brothers. Normally when I'm home we can play dungeons and dragons together along with my father. Though with this game the distance between us feels like nothing. We can play together all night long talking about everything but also enjoying a fan-♥♥♥♥ing-tastic game together. Exploring and debating on how to deal with certain situations and really role-playing any character we create together. I love this game and recommend it to everyone I come across.","September 14, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

757,"First time writing a review and wow does this game absolutely deserve it. If you're a fan of cRPG's in any sense (think Baulder's Gate) you will absolutely love this. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, the graphics are great, the gameplay is where it REALLY shines. The fights are difficult, the AI is actually smart, and tactician will put your characters through a grinder when you thought you had it down. At no point in the game did I feel like it was a slog or a chore to get through during my first playthrough, there was always something meaningful I could do. Just one more side quest before the main story, helping out this one person, talking to this one chicken. The story is also very well done, I feel as though I could actually talk to the characters if they were real people, they are fleshed out very well. Larian is an extremely awesome company, they delayed the release of the game to add in a fully voiced game due to community request. They listen to their customers, apply the feedback properly, and keep them updated. Definitely the best game company out there right now. The first act is a very good tutorial, the second act builds the world and the story, and act 3 and 4 take the fun of those two and multiply it by 5. I don't have enough good things to say about this game. The only negative is that it has now ruined so many others for me, because they won't be as good as this. Now I'm bored and don't know what else to start playing. Ratings: Music: 15/10 (seriously the soundtrack is THAT good) Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Difficulty: 10/10 (has difficulties for all levels of players) Overall it is a top 3 game that I have ever played.

761,"Probably the longest review I have ever written or will ever write, unless Original Sin 3 comes soon, SO, TL:DR; This has become my favorite game of all time. It's the best CRPG I've played since the old school ones, and then adds more mechanics and better story telling. Pros: -Elemental Interactions -Companions so good I had a hard time picking who to bring in my party -Fun combat and mechanics -Excellent puzzle design for Acts I and II, and just really really good puzzle design in Act III. -Compelling storyline, that ties in neatly with the other Divinity games, without requiring you to play them (though you should) -No microtransactions, season pass, loot boxes, etc. -Able to respec your character as much as you want -Excellent skill management system -Excellent crafting systems -Excellent visuals in regard to spell effects and great art design -Excellent RPG elements, relative to character creation, talents, skills and tags -The music is off the charts for the most part -Great voice acting and sound design -Choices that actually matter during the story and change the story -Oddly descriptive ""intamacy"" scenes if you romance a character (is that a pro, maybe, it was well written) -Difficult enought that I was challenged and died plenty on the second highest difficulty, but never felt frustrated enough to quit or scum the game -Excellent game, because there's no other word I can use to describe it. Cons: -Had a crashing issue during a few of the cut scenes between Acts -Music repeats a lot if you're repeatedly getting in and out of combat -Items like arrows and grenades get auto added to your hot bar, and I constantly had to clean it out for skills to be in the order I want, playing as a polymorph character I had a lot of skills appearing and disappearing between combat Overall, you should play this game if you like turn based CRPGs, RPGs in general, turn based games, good games or even if you just want to support a great indie game dev. It reminded me of Dark Souls 1, where when I finished my first playthrough, I instantly made a new character, and started to play again with a completely different play style. Update: you should also nominate and vote for this game whenever possible, so it can get some well deserved praise.","November 9, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

764,"A beautiful cluster****. Full disclosure - the only other game in the Divinity series I've ever played to completion is Dragon Commander, which couldn't be more different than this one. I didn't enjoy Original Sin 1. I didn't get it. It was so strange to me - because it was a mechanics-focused RPG. Everything interacted with everything else, and the possibilities seemed endless. The story didn't grab me, and such things are important in a cRPG, and so I eventually abandoned it. Initially, I was afraid I would feel the same about Original Sin 2. The first act isn't particularly strong, but thankfully, I endured for enough time for the story to sink its hooks into me. Ironically enough, it was only then that I realized all of Original Sin 2's virtues, which have little to nothing to do with its plot. Original Sin 2, like its predecessor, is about the you can pull off both in and out of combat. Environmental hazards are everywhere, from water to blood to poison to ice to fire- and they interact in often explosive ways to different skills, items and spells. The game gives you access to the game-changing Teleport skill very early on, and this is what blows the whole thing wide open. With it, you can teleport any character or item, anywhere within sight. The sheer amount of battlefield and exploration applications were enough for me to force all my party members to learn it. Teleport party members across chasms, onto vantage points. Teleport distant enemies to kill zones, environmental hazards, or on top of one another. Another beautiful example is the dialogue system. Namely - dialogue only freezes the characters that are actively engaged in said dialogue. Whilst your main character is speaking to a soon-to-be-hostile NPC, the rest of your party can get into position, set up traps and hazards, pickpocket the distracted NPC, or even teleport them around the map, all before combat even starts. Divinity Original Sin 2 is very exploitable by nature. The amount of cheese strategies available to creative players is utterly disgusting - and this is clearly intentional, and I love Larian for it. I watched a video that involved the almost useless Telekinesis skill, which is used solely for moving and picking up objects at the distance - used to instagib monsters and NPCs by way of shoving an ultra-heavy crate filled with other, ultra-heavy crates. You can customize your characters to a laudable degree, even with the option of making them Undead, which of course brings all sorts of wacky interactions, such as having to steal faces not to be attacked on sight, being damaged by healing but healed by poison. You can create your characters if you wish, or you can use pre-built characters the game already has. In truth, there is no downside to this. The advantage of pre-built characters is that they have their own voice actors, personalities and, critically, personal quests which they progress through along with the game's main quest. You can customize everything else about them during character creation - class, attributes, even appearance. There are very few upsides to playing a non-pre-built character. You can have a party of up to 4 characters (there are 6 pre-built characters), or up to two Lone Wolves(a talent which makes characters stronger, but limits them to a party of two). You must choose a -main- character, though you can choose any among your party to partake in dialogue. You will largely see the world through the eyes of your chosen main character. tl;dr - A blast. I was foolish not to have realized it before. Larian has always had a distinct style that blends fantasy and humor. In that, they remain entertaining as ever. The story, as I've said before, took a while before showing what it is truly about, but once it did, it remained engaging throughout. The plot itself isn't as good as an Obsidian would make it, and the characters are more threadbare than Bioware would craft them - but they're , make no mistake. I've heard some confusion from longtime fans of the Divinity series about if this game is a prequel or a sequel to some earlier games in the franchise. There doesn't seem to be much consensus, as it could be either, with radically different implications for each possibility. As a person who hasn't played the games that more directly tie into this one, such as Divine Divinity and the Dragon Knight games, things can sometimes seem disjointed and barely explained. Lucian, the Black Ring, Deathfog and the fall of the elven kingdoms, Source and Sourcerers(and how it is different from ordinary magic), Godwoken - It all took a while to fit into place. And Malady? I was profoundly confused. I like the character, but she seems to drop from the sky at the end of Act I and takes the reins of the entire plot with little to no explanation about the whos, whys and whats. And- heck, Windego, the game's intro narrator. she narrates the plot, and seems to take such an important role in narrating the ending - is a mystery. The game's characters are mostly serviceable. The pre-built party members are a cut above the rest. Well, all except Beast. I remain disappointed how dwarves are depressingly similar in all of fantasy. Putting on a pirate hat doesn't make one different enough. They even have elves in Divinity be gangly cannibalistic weirdos - but dwarves remain dwarves. The endings are also a disjointed mess, full of moving parts and stuffed at the end of a final battle that ends rather abruptly(and lets not forget the blatantly defective or just badly designed Anathema questline, which pays off about as much as the Mutated Toe in Fallout 2). Still, there's no denying that they're a better payoff than, let's say, Tyranny's endings. The cRPG genre has fierce competition in story and writing, and I believe that Larian found a handy way to go about things: The interveawing between the main plot and the individual (pre-built)character stories. The grandiose story runs the risk of making a protagonist feel like a nameless, faceless nobody that murderhobos his way to the end - but each character's personal quest is craftily sewn into the world's larger story, which gives precious context and a feeling of being connected to the game's events. This shouldn't be overlooked. Finally, Original Sin's Pet Pal talent returns triumphantly, allowing you to speak to each and every animal in the game, which not only grants you access to tons of new quests and content, but also up the comedic factor by several orders of magnitude. I will never forget the amazing bringing the sole survivor chick Peeper on an epic journey to find his Sourcerer father, the epic rooster Magicockarel. A mechanics-focused cRPG that teleports you♥♥♥♥♥first into a barrel of fun.",February 18,"2 people found this review helpful

770,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game has the potential to become a masterpiece. It has all the strenghts of the first game`s Enhanced Edition, offers turn-based combat and plenty elemental interactions (make it rain, aoe stun through blitz bolt - create a fire surface, throw poison onto it for a huge explosion etc.). You can play with up to four party members and can either create your own character or take one of the four (after full release six) pre-made characters. While the first game lacked in the story, this 2nd part is much better in this regard. It has a much darker tone and so far the story delivers fully. It is grim, entertaining and really complex. Also the possibility of party dialogue and getting different results when talking with different party members to certain NPCs enlagerns its richness in this regard. But the strogest point of Divinity Origial Sin has always been its combat system. And the second part adds more features to that and makes everything even better. You now have aroumr fore physical and magic damage, which you have to break first in order to inflict status elements like stunned or burning or knocked down. Also there is a height system now, that your ranged characters can use for greater range and more damage. And last but not least the game has after the full release on the 14th of September a Game Master Mode. There you can basically develop and play your own adventures with the Divinity engine and UI. With this you can create your own D&D - campaign and play it with your friends. Another small feature is the Arena Mode, where you can explore the combat system with pre-defined characters on several maps. All this features offer easy access to multiplayer, I have atm ver 250 hours into this already great game and multiplayer worked fine every time. I regard Divinity Original Sin 2 in the highest order. This game was highly enjoyable already in its year in Early Access although it missed some of its features. Full release is now only two weeks away and if you like calssic RPGs which give you a challenging gameplay, try this game out. If you are into turn - based combat and tactical RPGs, you will find a great time here.

775,"Bang up ♥♥♥♥ing game. Seriously, best RPG in many, MANY years. I haven't ever really reviewed a game before, so I'm going to give it my best shot. This game is about as close to DND on a digital medium that you can get while still being its own game. Fully interactive environment, (tons of fire, electricuting water, exploding oil and poison) and the developers really played with it. Just a small spoiler alert, but to just put it in perspective how the environment comes into play. There's one fight pretty far into the game on top of a mountain of wreckage. Out of absolutely nowhere, tons of oily blobs come to kill you. Every time you damage them, and they move, they spread oil. So the whole time, you're trying to batter them down as you move up the mountain to get away from them. The dev's then have it to where when the oily guys finally go down, TONS of fire guys show up and ignite all the oil. I know its kinda hard to get it across, but fighting ontop of this giant mound with fire everywhere trying to batter down the fiery slimes, seriously felt cool. Character creation wise, I mean it's pretty good. Not a ton of customization, just standard face 1, 2, 3, etc. But honestly not a big deal. As you develop what your character is good at, you grow to love em. Classes are pointless, you build your character the way YOU want to, so they can literally become anything. I've got a few characters going, and all feel super unique and diverse. A dwarven rogue shapeshifter who can grow a tentacle arm and smack people around as well as shed all enemies magical resistances to support, I've got a fire slinging geomancer who uses oil♥♥♥♥♥♥to explode just about everyone, and I've got a necromancer archer who summons tons of undead corpses to explode all over people. It all feels super unique and fun to play. There's times where I miss my other characters, hop on them to play, and then miss the one I was just playing. Kinda neat. If you want my advice, 100+ hours advice, PLAY WITH FRIENDS. Preferrably in person. Hit up an old school lan party feel, bring cpu's over, build a SUPER diverse cast of characters, and hunker down. Pizza and beer obviously. Plan for an all nighter, because I literally PROMISE you you'll be playing til 6am EASY. I haven't personally had a game grab me like that in many years, and god damn its a good feeling to have back.

I highly suggest you play coop because the dimension it adds to the game is so much fun as you and friend(s) just run into all the quirks and silliness. Every fight can be one if you just switch it up and try out new tactics.. or just get lucky! The amount of details and love put into this game makes AAA companies look like indie developers. The game is not without its flaws, the crafting is shallower than it can be, some armors/weapons never would have a use in someone who wants to win, misclicking on things in battle can really mess up a long fight and turn the tide negatively and the rest is mainly just nit-picky stuff. Overall this game is a solid product, it looks nice, it plays nice and its completely mastered the art of an rpg in a sandboxm, meaning you have rules and tools, but you can often abuse or mess around and accomplish things in interesting ways. This game is worth the cover charge and should be a no-brainer if you are on the fence and it is on sale!","October 8, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

And it feels good. And the game is still hard, battles are long and tactical. You can still die, but damn you can put up a fight. And the ending... amazing, Its very satisfying. You will not be dissapointed. It has its bugs and some uncompleted quests but nothing serious. Enjoy amazing writing, amazing story, and amazing characters. It ended and all i have is an aplause.

I already builded 5 Charectors all on Classic Difficulty, A Fighter Noble Soldier who try to help everyone he can travel with Red Prince ,Lohse and Fane. A Lone Wolf Rogue who steal everyone but help those in need. A Noble Ranger Elf travel with Sebille. A Necromancer who I still don't know what to do with her. An Elf Ranger who I play Co-op with my friend. A Fighter already out of Fort joy, A Noble Ranger Elf running around try to fine everything that we can do in Fort joy. What I find is every fastified, there is at least 3 solid ways to get out of Fort Joy if you play solo[one guy in party], Fight your way out, Boat, Secret ways and if have others in party, Teleport is also an option. I didn't go far because I want to try to build a different class and see how they perform, I also wanna know what Fort Joy have to offer, and I enjoy it a lot... Bewarn This game doesn't tell you what to do, this for some are bad... but for me, I believe others will love it. Don't know what to do? Ask around and you will find interesting side quest, and some hint of something bigger outside...This make discover more reward, no quest marker to make you feel like you're stupid or lazy quest writer who don't have to write a good paragraph because quest marker already done the job. Reading also be negative for some, I'm Thai and English is my 2nd-language but still have trouble with it yet. Gameplay Combat is turnbase which sadly turn others away... But believe me...This is Deep and every fastify Turn-Base game, making combo with class build, party and your surrounding make a turnbase game yet every dynamic and good gameplay.

787,"This review is just based on my first impressions of the game. Its worth getting. There is an insane amount of skills and combos you can do that a single play through will never allow you to see all the cool stuff you can do so the replay value is high. My favorite thing I've discovered in the game is the way recruiting followers works. First you must convince them to follow you to begin with, they dont just come along because you are the ""chosen one"" or some crap. To boot if you like a character you dont have to worry about him being a mage when you are already a mage because each character asks you what you want them to be. No longer are you forced to not take your favorite npc with you or forced to play a class you dont like just to take it with you. You can finally have a balanced party full of npc you find interesting hurrah. The only thing I would ""complain"" about is the lack of non human races. You got human, dwarf (small human), elf (vegetarian human), and lizard man (finally its not a human). Skeleton variations of all is nice to throw in but I honestly am just done with every fantacy game haveing there races be the 3 over used races, human, elf, dwarf, and then a final race being there own ""custom"" race that just turn out to be another human but blue or something like that. Glad we got lizard men but wish we had a few more. This game has a lot of thought put into it and it somehow didn't lauch at the $60 price point, with mod support.

794,"This is one of the most immersive games I've played in years. The graphics are great for a CRPG, the story is engrossing, and every line of dialogue is fully voiced. There is so much depth in every aspect of the game. The character customization, crafting system, and combat are some of the best I've seen in any game, let alone any CRPG. Combat encounters are difficult without feeling unfair. Others may feel differently, but as a casual player, I found the ""classic"" difficulty setting to be just about perfect. Combat is turn-based, but it is sort of a mix between tactical turn-based combat, and the classic RTS-Style combat of games such as Baldur's Gate. Players are definitely rewarded for being creative in combat, so simply running the party headlong into an encounter isn't always the best strategy. The Divinity world has some interesting twists on the generic fantasy setting. Each quest and side quest feels unique, and characters (even minor characters), are interesting and realistic. This game also has some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in an rpg, which is crazy, given how much dialogue there is. The attention to detail is absolutely amazing, resulting in tons of secrets to uncover in the world, as well as complex interactions between items, characters, etc. Here's a fun example: When a character is wounded in (or out) of combat, blood can splatter onto the ground. This blood can be frozen, resulting in a slippery patch of ice on the ground, or struck with a bolt of lightning, shocking anyone who is touching the puddle. The blood could also be absorbed for health by a necromancer. Somehow the game doesn't feel like it has a steep learning curve, despite all of this richness and complexity. There's a lot more to say, but I'll keep this review short. If you have any interest in CRPGs, or RPGs in general, you should check this game out.",March 13,2 people found this review helpful

800,EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I was very skeptical about this game. How can a top down SRPG not be boring? But after some persuasion from a friend i finally decided to buy it and play it with them and lo' and behold i was astounded by how fun this game is. The puzzles and battles are the most strategic and amazing srpg battles I seen with environmental destruction being an awesome gimmick. The story is simple yet effective with a huge world with plenty to do and graphics are amazingly beutiful. I was never bored playing it. It will be amazing to see this game get finished and voice acting added(which is in the orginal Divinity). But for an early access it does give you a good taste of the game and you can tell the finished product will be great.,"April 30, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
801,"Loved the first game, despite its flaws. I feel like this game fixes every issue the first game had and across the board improves on it - my hat off to Larian Studios for listening to feedback. While the story and setting is darker, there is so much humor sprinkled into this game. With the addition of voice acting, I find myself listening to everything. I didn't know how to feel about the narration at first, but it has grown on me and I feel like it's a great addition to the game. The Origin stories are a neat touch, I am doing my first playthrough as Lohse and I feel like mine is the most interesting of the group. Definitely want to try Fane next. Overall, its a beautiful game with great little details hidden everywhere. (Also the music is great) I have a hard time coming up with any real criticisms of the game, but I will try. I wish there was a better loot system - i play ranged and I just never get to loot anything, which isn't very fun. Some of the quests I've run into were bugged, so that's a bummer but I'm sure they'll be fixed in the near future and I can do them on my Tactician playthrough. I feel like playing with 4 people pulls the game into too many directions, I miss stuff that other people are doing and everyone wants to have the feeling of exploration - that's not really a game flaw, I just think it'd be a better experience with 1-2 players.","September 25, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

I don't normally get sucked into RPGs and their stories, but this one is special. Larian Studios has poured love into it, and it shows. There is also no unnecessary DRM.

809,"I was very reluctant to get this game. It was expensive, and I never even far outside of Cyseal in the first Divinity: Original Sin game. I found the first game much too difficult and complex. I then got the Enhanced Edition and recently (about a few weeks ago) got into it as I read the description and apparently you could change the mode. I chose Explorer. Still didn't invest enough time to get very far. October 5, 2017 I finally got this game, started it up, and was bombarded with numerous and amazing features. For example, the ability to choose Origin characters or create your own. There were more class-types and the environment was spectacular! This is the best looking game I've ever played. To the rest of the game; I've played numerous times, only escaping Reaper Isles once but not even going farther than that. I've played as one Origin character in a party and an undead human conjurer as a lone wolf. Now I'm an Origin character lone wolf and am STILL having fun. I am still finding new things throughout my few playthroughs, like the cat familiar. :D I also found a lot of other unique treasures and hidden places around Fort Joy and I enjoy finding them. I am in love with Divinity: Original Sin 2. The price tag may be high, but the gameplay, content, and immersion is amazing!

I love the new class skills, the new races, and simplified crafting system. The game is appropriately difficult, and you will most likely have to do some battles more then once to figure it out. So save often. Build craft is so much fun in the game, and the replay value is very clear from the start. I keep wanting to make new characters just to try things differently. I love Love LOVE playing a Rouge. Teleporting, sneaking, stealing and back-stabbing. It's just the best. The multiplayer in this game is a lot of fun too. I play with my husband for hours on our days off. We yell at eachother from other rooms to try and figure out a strategy, or when one of use screws up and kills the other. I feel like you wanna play this with someone you really like though, because the first time they accidentally stun you, and ruin your big attack you've been setting up, you'll wanna kill them. I am very glad this game is Co-op though. We need more games like this in the world. So, get this game. You already want to, or else you wouldn't be here. Just do it.

817,What do you get when DnD is ported into the digital world? Answer: Divinity: Original Sin 2. The game capitalizes on turn-based combat and does it right. The world is vast and there are countless personalities and quests to encounter. I'm only around 12 hours in and I know this game is gonna take up most of my time for the coming months. If you enjoy captivating story-telling and nail-biting action then this title is for you. Pros: 1. Amazing story-telling that is so good you have to listen to what this person/creature has to say 2. Interesting preset characters to choose from or interact with 3. Complex but understandable progression system 4. Various spells that can change the tide of battle 5. Dozens and dozens of items that all have their purpose 6. Stunning graphics that bring the game to life 7. The Narrator describes the scenarios and situation in great fashion 8. You can talk to pigs/squirrels/cats 9. You can talk to cats 10. I already love DnD Cons: 1. Not enough races to choose from (IMO) 2. Heavy lore may not be appealing to newcomers 3.

825,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Every once in a while, I get this unscratchable itch to play an RPG that allows for the freedom to not only get lost in the world and lore set before me, but to also interact and complete quests in a very open ended manner, create really unique characters with their own unique stories and ideals, and even have an actual sense of tabletop-esq role play while playing both solo and multiplayer. I've always wanted to be able to (for example) choose between either fighting a group of guards, stealth and skullduggery to sneak my way in, cause a major distraction and simply walk in, or whatever else possibility is necessary to achieve my goals of breaking into the captian's office to obtain incriminating documents. Then along comes Divinity: Original Sin 2. A massive step up from D:OS1, (An already legendary CRPG) in just about every single major category. This EA is a very old build of what the final game will be if you've been keeping up with the Larian Dev Vids on YouTube and it still doesn't fail to astound me and scratch that itch.

837,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I'll keep it simple by listing my least favorite thing (which isn't even that bad), to my favorite aspect of this game. My biggest Con: - Substantial UI Changes from Divinity: Original Sin that may take some time to get used to. It doesn't always feel like the most natural or intuitive system. My biggest Pro: + The storytelling between different characters/companions is always unique. Dialogue options make a difference in how they interact with you, and how the entire game unfolds. I also love the new classes and spells they've added since Original Sin I. This game has come a long way from when I first purchased it in Early Access. Back then it already felt like a full game and a fascinating environment that I would be happy to spend hours in, and yet the development team continues to update and polish their game. It just keeps getting better, and more fleshed out as they reach their release date. If you were a fan of Divinity: Original Sin, you'd be a fool not to give this a try for two hours to see if you like it.","September 9, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
838,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Though it's still in beta, the game really attracts me with its special way of fighting. I've never played Original Sin 1, but it is truly a nice RPG game. It's a turn-based game, u'd better know that before buying it. But don't just say, ""I don't like turn-based games."" U'd better watch videos about this game, then u'll find it much different from that u imagined before. When out of fights, u'll control your team like in the game Dungeon Siege, only when fighting the enemy will u control your team in a turn-based way. Also, I really enjoyed the beautiful views a lot, u'll know what I mean when u truly play the game. This game is fantastic for me. Looking forward to play all chapters of it. But there are also some bad things to tell u. There r no marks on the map which show u where u can finish your mission. And u cant see the characters from about 2 screen's distence. That means u have to go to every corner and use your mouse to see NPCs' names. This will truly take players a lot of time unless they remember where the NPC is on receiving the mission. This game is very expensive, I know that, but it's worth buying for those who r interested in turn-based games. I really don't want to see red comments like"" why is this game turn-based? I spent fu*** over 40 dollars for this rubbish?"" That's your problem! Why don't u look at the introduction before buying it? I love this game, but also hope that after this beta, they'll add some more languages. we all hope to enjoy the game in a much easier way. Many Chinese players bought this game. Not like what we do to other games before, we write""Chinese please"" in blue comments. It shows that we truly love this game.","September 2, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

842,"Initially the turn based style dissuaded me from buying this game. Now that I have actually bought it and played it, probably one of the greatest strategy/RPG games I have ever played. Reminded me of a hybrid between Diablo, x-com and Skyrim. Main downside imo is keeping a track of your quests and what to do. the journal doesn't offer too much information which leads me to just going ton the DOS2 wiki or spend 5 hours trying to figure it out ¯\_(ツ)_/¯","October 3, 2017","2 people found this review helpful

843,"Have you ever wished upon a star? Did you wish for GEAR!!! Did you wish to get out of you ragged raggy rags and into non-ragged clothes and from there into worn out armor and from there into armor and then INTO SUPER ARMOR OF THE ABYSS!!! Then this is the game for you. The story will not compell you quite like your unquenchable quest for more GEAR!!! You will lie, steal, and KILL FOR GEAR!!! Be warned though that family and friends will try to get in the way of your quest FOR GEAR!!! With that said, the story is total♥♥♥♥♥♥ I don't know it AT ALL!

844,"This game blew me away. I watched the videos and read the reviews, I wasn't that excited. I didn't know anything about the game, I hadn't played DOS 1 either. I hit 100 hours in this game in three or four days, and have been impressed and re-impressed again at every turn. I started four or five campaigns with all of my friends. I am awestruck at the world they created, there are so many ways to do everything. When playing with my friends my jaw dropped when they casually mentioned their solution to a problem that I solved an entirely different way. I'm not normally a super RPG guy, but this game made me a hardcore fan. This is incredible. (also the music is 30/10)","November 22, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
845,"Pros: Amazing roleplaying/DnD feel. Interesting characters, witty writing, and I haven't played a game that left you this many choices since Fallout New Vegas (almost anyone can be killed at any time). Highly recommend playing one of the ""Origin"" players, or if not, at least having them as your party members, a lot of the great story telling revolves around them. Combat system is fun and allows for a lot of theory crafting/playstyles, to the point where even people who dont' care about the RP aspect of it at all still enjoy this game. Few gripes with certain aspets but overall it feels interesting/diverse. Fights are HARD, even on normal difficulty, but far from unbeatable. This game handles multiplayer in what is essentially a single player world better than any other game I've ever seen. The game is coded like an MMO, so you and your friends can travel hafl way across the world in a random pub and your friend can still play their game. Seemlessly allows you to hop in and out of someone's game too. Cons: Some weird quirks with combat that could be improved (fighting with characters while others are in dialogue, main attributes feeling uninterseting), but really this is just a tiny complaint. In the mid part of the game it's easy to lose focus, it's so open world that you can get bogged with side quests and forget what you were supposed to be doing in the first place. Crafting system/Inventory system feels a little meh. Crafting can honestly be 100% ignored so this doesn't detract from the game too much, but organizing /sorting through your inventory can feel tedious at times.",February 18,2 people found this review helpful

848,"Loved Divine Divinity, one of Larian's first RPGs back in the early 2000s. So I knew they had talent but, bizarrely, they've spent the last 15 years making very average games (with the first Original Sin being a possible exception). But this is something else. They've nailed it. It feels like they've finally made the game they wanted to make all those years ago. It's hard to list everything good about it, but the writing, the voice acting, the world building, the character development, the questing structure, the combat... it's all so effortlessly brilliant. It makes other genre greats like Pillars of Eternity look extremely average. And, if it isn't already, I can see it becoming one of my favourite RPGs ever.","October 10, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

863,"In this game, you have: Drive Challenge Fullfillment Excitment Freedom Learning Choice Consequence Wonder and the list goes on.... for awhile. AWHILE! I can think of 4 legendary games of the early 2000's, games that help set the foundation to gaming and its take off over a decade ago. These games of the past are a staple to our [gaming community] foundation. Though apparently forgotten by history if I judged soley at the sore site of 90% of AAA game developers today.. Thes dev's of Divinity OSII, Larian Studios did not forget what gaming was and still is suppose to be. I don't know if resemblance was intentional but I can't help but think of a few games that this game reminds me of however, often I don't hold it to that and because I just want to play Diviniy II, as Divinity II. I wont describe it (being the games it resembles and the game itself) because I feel that takes away from the spectacular creation that is Divinity Original Sin II, after all. the creators have no doubt been influenced, but in the best ways ever possible. They took glorious ancient concepts and with a few unique features I've only see them do, and make it all their own. Plus it is a game you will have enjoyed 10 to 100 if not 1000 times more if you just go in. Maybe watch the first steam video like I did, but that's all I did and as a result I find something amazing. And by the time I'm done with it. Which will be awhile- I am looking forward to say, it is the best game, I have played, ever.

867,"After playing dozens of hours with my buds across a few different timezones I can honestly say that this game has brought us fun and memories few others have. The combat is engrossing, satisfying, and keeps you talking. You are encourged to work together and experiment, and the massive freedom of choice in the game means you'll never know what someone is going to get your party into. However, that same freedom can also mean that you aren't always clear on the ""right"" way to go, so you might spend some time exploring or consulting guides. You can always make your own path if you want to though. There were a few odd bugs. One of my friends was having issues with his inventory just dissapearing. Reloads didn't fix it and he was unable to use any items. During combat, things aren't always crystal clear on what you can hit and what is in range, so sometimes you just have to wing it. It usually works out though. Not many complaints from me on this one, it'll go down as one of my fondest multiplayer experiences ever. Thanks to the devs for giving me great times with my friends.","December 6, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

Very nice voice acting, challenging and tactical battles, nice graphics - the full package. I agree with some reviews, that the combat is not easy, but honestly this is exactly what makes it fun... the combination of different elements, height differences, physics and the fact that even the simplest enemies have special skills etc. make each combat interesting. No more grinding through simple skeletons with the same tactics each time! Heroes will die and you will have a hard time to ressurect them. You will face enemies you can't beat (check their level before engaging) - there is no hand holding in this game!

879,"Divinity: Original Sin II Release: September 14, 2017 Genre: RPG Mode: Single-player, Multiplayer Gameplay: > 60 hours Achievements: Easy | Medium | Hard 10/10 Strategy is the key to complete this game. The game already begins at your character creation screen, where there are options like: Race, Talents, Abilities, Skills, Class etc. given to you. Everything you choose from here on will change the way you interact with the world. This makes this game so unbelievably huge. You can interact with literally everyone, you have the option to kill or spare one's life, there are multiple ways to complete a quest etc. But the most important thing of all: ""eveything you choose to do has its consequenses."" For instance, if you scold a character he will not like you therefore he won't trade with you no more. Or if you kill a character, you won't be able to finish a questline. Or you found a strange animal somewhere across the map which gained your liking and therefore he want to accompany you. This game is exactly what a RPG should be. Combat, story, freedom, humour and most of all the freedom to interact with everything.","November 22, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
880,"The storyline and side quests on this game were thoroughly enjoyable. I finished it in local co-op mode on the “easy” setting. While this made the fights easy-peasy (which also means they didn’t give that satisfying sense of achievement each time), the story kept the play time enjoyable. I always looked forward to returning to it. If you want truly difficult, there is that option, too, and you can browse through the other reviews to get a sense of folks’ experience with it. I also enjoyed customizing (and re-customizing) my character’s abilities. The game is good enough that it opens a way to re-do your character as often as you’d like fairly early on. This remains convenient throughout the rest of the game. So, I never felt like I had to agonize over a decision. I could always try some ability or characteristic choice and change it later if it wasn’t working out. I found it to be a great casual game!",July 4,2 people found this review helpful

885,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Every once in a while, I get this unscratchable itch to play an RPG that allows for the freedom to not only get lost in the world and lore set before me, but to also interact and complete quests in a very open ended manner, create really unique characters with their own unique stories and ideals, and even have an actual sense of tabletop-esq role play while playing both solo and multiplayer. I've always wanted to be able to (for example) choose between either fighting a group of guards, stealth and skullduggery to sneak my way in, cause a major distraction and simply walk in, or whatever else possibility is necessary to achieve my goals of breaking into the captian's office to obtain incriminating documents. Then along comes Divinity: Original Sin 2. A massive step up from D:OS1, (An already legendary CRPG) in just about every single major category. This EA is a very old build of what the final game will be if you've been keeping up with the Larian Dev Vids on YouTube and it still doesn't fail to astound me and scratch that itch. We still have GM Mode to look forward to, and full mod support, and the fully unlocked campaign! TLDR; 10/10","September 2, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

894,"I'm a big fan of looting. This game is the ultimate loot-game. I always loot everything. I'm also a very impatient person. This leads to me often skipping conversations, and suddenly I'm declared a hero, and have 10 people attacking me. This could be catastrophic, but as I said, I always loot. Turns out drinking tea and spend half the match eating random items is a very good strategy. My co-op partner in crime is not a looter, but actually reads the dialogue. Working together is thus a very good way of playing. He gets all the story + depth of the game while I get to spend more time around looting. A tip tho: Distribute the loot, quite impractical when the team member with all the healing + scrolls manages to set herself on fire and die... 3 attempts in a row. Just waiting for the loot from the kickstarter now.

896,EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Probably gonna be the best game of the year.,"September 21, 2016",2 people found this review helpful
897,"This game is now my most favorite game, I played DOS twice, one playthrough by myself (150 hours) and one with my friend (60 hours). I can say that I really enjoyed the first game and was really looking forward to DOS 2. I'm almost 200 hours into it and I am not even done with the campaign. But being nearly done I think I can give a proper review. Combat: So most people criticize the game for being turn-based rather than a real-time with pause function. But it feels right in place as the combat still feels so engaging. The combat is tougher since a lot of skills that you have, the enemies have as well. This makes the combat harder but also more rewarding once you get past it. The game is hard yet fair. There are fights that seem impossible but the game provides us with the tools to win or hides the tools within the world. A lot of the skills feel strong and useful. But towards the end game, I find that magic damage started to be more obsolete as it is much faster and easier to physical as that it the most reliable way to damage. Though that might be because my team consisted of 3 physical dealers and one wizard. Story: This is by far my favorite part of the game. The story is rather simple yet done in a way that makes it compelling. And as someone who played the other Divinity games, there are a lot of surprising plot twists that I was surprised by. But where the game shines the most is the origin stories. You can either create your own character or choose one of 6 pre-made origin characters that have their own backgrounds. And and these stories are very well-written with equally well made characters. It is so interesting to see how much the game changes because of who you are. If you didn't pick an origin character, you can still recruit them but after a certain point, they will become unavaible. It is a rather intersting thing of being a side character to the origin character's stories though. And each origin chracter will have a personal quest which will result in some drastic endings. But some advice, do not play as Lohse. Not because she is bad, she is a great character with a one of my favorite stories. But Lohse is best when played as a companion and her personal ending yields the best reward a video game has ever given. UI: I will be blunt about it, it's bad. Inventory management is a nightmare. Sadly it is also required in powering up your weapons in the end game. You will spend a long time in your inventory looking through it to find a single item. Crafting can be done through a seperate menu but most of the time you will be combing random stuff together and that is horrible. In the end game, you will have so much clutter mostly involving books and paper with no swift and reliable way to dispose of them. Other Notes: The game has quite alot of bugs as well. The first area will be rather polished because it was in early access for a long time. But the game is large and some parts are even broken at times. But I would like to say that I have not faced a bug bad enough to take away from my enjoyment. The game is best played (in my opinion) with a roll with it attitude. Just accept mistakes that happen. It is really fun to see all my mistakes bite me in the♥♥♥♥♥later down the line. And before I forget, the soundtrack. It is a masterpiece. DOS 2 has a different composer from the past Divinity games (RIP Kirill) but the new composer has truly put his heart and soul into it and it is an absolute joy to listen to. Just buy the game. Larian deserves all of the praise and hopefully they will make a console version so we all can share in the masterpiece that is Divinity Original Sin.","November 2, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

902,"I took a bit of a punt on this game. I hadn’t played the original and I’ve never really had much of an interest in Baldur’s Gate style RPGs. But a couple of friends were really enjoying it and I was suffering from PUBG fatigue so I went ahead and bought it a few weeks after its release. I’m really glad I did! The first thing I liked was that it doesn’t require you to have played the first game to understand what is going on. It doesn’t assume knowledge of characters, events or setting. Everything comes at you in the context of the world you are in. The RPG elements are easy to get to grips with. There are a massive number of skills to learn and I found that my party almost organically grew into distinct classes. I ended up with a warrior, a ranger, a wizard and an assassin. But I never felt like I was limited to a class because of the choices I’d made. I started to give my warrior some magical skills mid-way through my current playthrough and it works. Weapon and armour stats are simple too. The bigger the numbers, the better the item. I like that simplicity. That's not to say there is no depth. You'll often need to compromise between armours physical strength defence and magical strength defence for example. And a weapon may give you buffs and skills that the high level shiny sword you've just looted does not. The world is massive. At the time of writing I’ve put in about 80 hours and I think I’m a little over half way through the game. At times the game can be a little intimidating. On arriving in a new area you can find yourself picking up quest after quest after quest. That many of these quests are not signposted on your map means you’re going to have to read the description to figure out where to go and what to do. I have quite a short attention span and so having to force myself to pay attention to the details and to keep referring to my log book was an interesting challenge that, somewhat surprisingly, I found I liked a lot. The turn based combat reminds me a lot of the first two Fallout games, right down to the number of moves you can make being displayed as circular ‘pips’. Fights are genuinely thrilling encounters where tactics will play a huge part in your winning (or losing) a battle. High ground confers a damage bonus. Different spells will interact with one another to produce (often unwanted) side effects. I’ve found myself having to sacrifice party members in a fight for a strategic advantage. The same fight might play out in different ways depending on how you approach it. Some fights can be avoided altogether if you’re a quick talker! The biggest problem I have with the game is almost a contradiction of what I like about the game. It encourages you to explore. Very little is laid out for you. You need to learn the games mechanics and your path through its world yourself. Your choices are not restrictive. However, I did get to a point, early on, where it felt like I was being constrained to a certain path through the world because so many of the combat situations I was getting into were unwinnable. A couple of turns against the AI and I was dead. This was slightly frustrating as it meant a good deal of trial and error and quite a bit of backtracking. Ultimately it felt like a waste of time. But the counter argument is that it falls in line with the games mechanics. It does not lead you from one point to the next. You have to figure stuff out for yourself. So yes, I’m very happy I picked this up and would absolutely recommend it, certainly from the position of someone who is perhaps typically more into action games than RPGs. I’ll definitely be picking up the original Divinity once I finally finish this game.","November 27, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

906,This is one of the only games where you can: 1. Trade with 97% of npcs 2. Kill those NPCs and actually get what they were selling (including keys) 3. Kill quest givers (has consequences) 4. Teleport Everything 5. Steal everything 6. Talk to everything (including animals with Pet Pal) 7. Find every way to solve a problem that was clearly not intended 8. Stun an enemy by electryifying their blood then laser ray them 9. Get beaten by AI because enemies are smarter than you If you thought maybe you could do something; you can 10/10,January 21,2 people found this review helpful

910,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This simply is a game done right, it was even an early access and still managed to not be horrible to their life-blood(consumers). The only thing on my wish list is voice-acting. I kinda was spoiled by The divinity enhanced edition and really miss it honestly, but I also understand how hard it would be to voice-act the crazy amount of dialog throughout this game.

911,"I've rarely been engrossed in an RPG like this one. This one goes up with the best RPG experiences of all time for me. I rate it better than my favorites Baldurs Gate and Baldurs Gate 2. While I don't give this better marks than Witcher 3 (I mean... seriously I don't see how you could), this title is supremely worthy of purchase to anyone who calls themselves an RPG fan. I could go on and on about how interesting the character building is in this game, but its probably one of the more frustrating aspects of the title. Their are so many choices, its difficult to fit all of them in, in a single play through. While I do consider their to be some balancing issues between physical/melee and ranged/magic, I do imagine that player mods will one day solve this. If players committed to making engrossing campaigns (or the developers continued to add-on to this title) I'd be set in my deeply-rooted RPG needs for years to come. Kudos to them for actually coming up with a storyline that interested me, and wasn't filled with standard fantasy tropes. I really enjoyed this, despite not having completed it yet. This is a magical title and you need to buy it, even if you don't enjoy this particular style of game.","September 29, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
912,"If I were to qualify this game with the fewest amount of words possible, I'd say 'Frustratingly addictive'. For a more detailed breakdown, please read below. The positives: Divinity: Original Sin 2 has an interesting and engaging story. If you play with some of the origin characters, your experience will be even richer. The game is rendered in a beautiful engine, enriching the expirience even further. The world of Rivellon is very detailed and vast, offerring a lot of opportunities to wonder off the beaten path. Exploration is rewarded with hidden treasure, encounters etc. Combat really shines with tactical options. The negatives: For a newcomer to this franchise this game felt really frustrating at times, especially during combat. It seems that most enemies you face have mobility skills and ranged attacks, which your party may lack in the beginning. Ths story felt really complex and there were cases where I no longer understood which allegiance I should honor. Overall, I would still recommend anyone who enjoys RPGs to give D:OS 2 a try. Despite some of its flaws it is a solid role playing game. PS. Is it me, or the UI looks a lot like Diablo 3?","November 26, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

918,"Divinity Original Sin II is a true masterpiece...the best game of the year 2017. 10/10. Every aspect is of such high quality: the dialogue, the voice acting, the music, the excellent UI, the art style, the graphics, the amazing combat mechanics, the sense of exploration and adventure, the level design, the encounter design, the pacing... it's all super well done, way above what you normally get in an rpg. There's such a large amount of things to find, places to explore, animals to talk to (If you have the required talent) and let’s not forget, towns filled with victims to pickpocket! There are so many different classes you can have and you're not limited in any way, you could be a rogue necromancer or a tank archer if you wanted. I'm 60+ hours in and it has not gotten tedious or started to feel formulaic or repetitive, which is something that I've never seen happen in a long single player game either. The side stories, environments and things you do are varied enough to feel fresh after 60+ hours, the sense of exploration and adventure never goes away. Every time you level up or progress further in the story you are rewarded with new spells and abilities that keep expanding on the combat and allowing you to experiment and try new builds and tactics, which keeps you from falling into familiar combat patterns/habits and keeps you entertained. Watch on youtube some gameplay, buy the game. This is one game you won’t regret buying.","October 15, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

921,"In this game, you have: Drive Challenge Fullfillment Excitment Freedom Learning Choice Consequence Wonder and the list goes on.... for awhile. AWHILE! I can think of 4 legendary games of the early 2000's, games that help set the foundation to gaming and its take off over a decade ago. These games of the past are a staple to our [gaming community] foundation. Though apparently forgotten by history if I judged soley at the sore site of 90% of AAA game developers today.. Thes dev's of Divinity OSII, Larian Studios did not forget what gaming was and still is suppose to be. I don't know if resemblance was intentional but I can't help but think of a few games that this game reminds me of however, often I don't hold it to that and because I just want to play Diviniy II, as Divinity II. I wont describe it (being the games it resembles and the game itself) because I feel that takes away from the spectacular creation that is Divinity Original Sin II, after all. the creators have no doubt been influenced, but in the best ways ever possible. They took glorious ancient concepts and with a few unique features I've only see them do, and make it all their own. Plus it is a game you will have enjoyed 10 to 100 if not 1000 times more if you just go in. Maybe watch the first steam video like I did, but that's all I did and as a result I find something amazing. And by the time I'm done with it. Which will be awhile- I am looking forward to say, it is the best game, I have played, ever.

927,"Pros: Amazing roleplaying/DnD feel. Interesting characters, witty writing, and I haven't played a game that left you this many choices since Fallout New Vegas (almost anyone can be killed at any time). Highly recommend playing one of the ""Origin"" players, or if not, at least having them as your party members, a lot of the great story telling revolves around them. Combat system is fun and allows for a lot of theory crafting/playstyles, to the point where even people who dont' care about the RP aspect of it at all still enjoy this game. Few gripes with certain aspets but overall it feels interesting/diverse. Fights are HARD, even on normal difficulty, but far from unbeatable. This game handles multiplayer in what is essentially a single player world better than any other game I've ever seen. The game is coded like an MMO, so you and your friends can travel hafl way across the world in a random pub and your friend can still play their game. Seemlessly allows you to hop in and out of someone's game too. Cons: Some weird quirks with combat that could be improved (fighting with characters while others are in dialogue, main attributes feeling uninterseting), but really this is just a tiny complaint. In the mid part of the game it's easy to lose focus, it's so open world that you can get bogged with side quests and forget what you were supposed to be doing in the first place. Crafting system/Inventory system feels a little meh. Crafting can honestly be 100% ignored so this doesn't detract from the game too much, but organizing /sorting through your inventory can feel tedious at times.",February 18,2 people found this review helpful

The story is great, the gameplay is fantastic. Really solid game. The only thing that makes me sad is that I think the lore of the games seems to be a little inconsistent and I can't find about it much on the web.

934,"The Divinity Original Sin games are some of those hidden gems of gaming that you may have never heard of, but they just amaze you ones you start to play them. Divinity Original sin 2 is like its predecessor focused on strategic gameplay, turn-based combat, and clever conversations. If you loved Divinity Original Sin 1 (or EE) you will love this one, and if you love old school strategic turn-based gameplay with focus on conversations (E.g. actually reading the quest description) then this game is for you. In addition to being a completely new game, Divinity Original Sin 2 introduces new races like undead, new spells, magic armor (absorbs CC effects) and more. Pros: - Deep questlines with choices. - Lots of different spells, talents, and abilities, that you choose almost freely. - Turn based tactical combat that forces you to think. - Voice acting on all conversations. Cons: - Can be brutally hard if you make the wrong choices (E.g. wrong set of spells, companions, or kills the wrong person). Would rate it 9/10. The game has everything, but can be quite a challenge if you make a lot of wrong choices. My Experience: Personally i have restarted my journey one time, as the first time i played i had to figure out what spells, companions and combinations of melee, ranged, magic i wanted. This game is not plug and play, and i would say it is more difficult in classic mode (normal) from the beginning then Divinity Orginal Sin EE Classic mode. You are very early on forced to look for scraps, craft gear and prepare yourself as mutch as possible in order to progress through combat. Combat is even more brutal this time around as the new magic and physical armor will prevent you from CC your enemies until it is destroyed. The game rewards you for hard work, but you will have to work hard from very early on. Good Luck!","September 17, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

940,"I spent 99% of the time dicking around exploring the map. In many other games I wouldn't have had a great time doing that because the map would end or there wouldn't be anything particularly interesting to find. In say, Skyrim, there would probably be a cave with generic enemies to kill and that would be all. In this game though, there was always something utterly magical to find. I helped a rat and a turtle living in a cellar find love. I talked to and killed evil scarecrows and helped a succubus escape a twisted hellscape with her lover. I broke into the cellar of a kindly old woman who offered me a loan after her cat told me there were suspicious types down there and found debt collectors who turned into demons when approached. Yet the most magical thing of all is how natural and meaningful it felt. As a I naturally progressed through the game's story, I ran into so many bits that rewarded this idle and almost obsessive exploration. Indeed, the story is so wonderfully open ended at times giving such simple yet broad goals that the only correct thing you can do at times is explore and lose yourself in this magical world that Larian has made. Despite the broad nature of most of your goals the story still manages to remain present and intelligent. Oftentimes it will surprise you by popping up at the most unexpected moments with new twists and turns in the most natural of fashions leading up to a conclusion that is both epic and satisfying. At the beginning, your goal is simple: escape Fort Joy. The game gives you little to no guidance on how you might do that yet you'll never feel at a lost since you'll discover so many possible ways to escape just by naturally exploring your environment. This is easily the best game I have ever played. There is so much magic, so much attention to detail, and a utterly brilliant and punishing battle system to boot. It will be a long, long time before a game ever comes close to how good this game is.","September 30, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

946,"Okay, this review is way overdue, but I wanted to take all the time I need to fully explore this game before getting it up. This proved more difficult than I hoped for a few different reasons and I’ve decided just to take what I have got and get this review up now. Because this game deserves the praise. I did a review for the beta, and to be honest, not much can be changed from that previous one. But I will try and do a change up and update. In DOS 2, you play as a Sourcer, an individual able to use a powerful magic known as Source. Unfortunately for you at the time of the game, said magic has some negative issues and you are persecuted and rounded up for 'curing'. Naturally, there is more to you then meets the eye, and your certainly not planning on sticking around for the 'cure'. This evolves into a deep and complex plot as you go on a quest not only to save the world, but to become the next divine, a form of demi-god. Only thing is, only one of four characters can be that. Starting off with gameplay, first off, you have excellent roleplaying potential. You can select one of a few origin stories or create your own custom character, with their own origins, starting abilities and ‘tags’, which offer additional dialogue options and opens up several possibilities in interactions. There are no classes in the game (the 'classes' you pick at the start of the game only really define your starting abilities, stats and maybe appearance.) which coupled with the simple, but very nicely done customisation system and wide range and freedom of dialogue lets you create the character you want to roleplay as in game. This is especially true with the ability to play the game you want to play it. Be a noble knight? Check. Be an anti-heroic rogue? Check. Kill every sucker in sight for the lols? Well, not everyone so you don't break the game, but check. Which leads me onto the combat. I love it. It's the good old fashioned slow-paced turn based gameplay that is so rarely used nowadays outside of some specific games. You can use basic attacks, abilities, consumables and magic to fight your way through your encounters, or, with a bit of luck, avoid them. You can utilise your abilities and the environment to create powerful combinations for attack and defence and there is a great deal of strategy and tactics to be had, encouraging you to think before you act. When you win a tough battle, you feel a sense of relief and of course, the feeling of being a badass. Also, unlike many RPGs, especially amongst the older ones and the MMO's, the game is complex enough to make you think and to make you invest time into the game, but simple enough not to confuse you or tire you out and hence allow you to stay immersed. Few games can get that balance right. Couple the roleplaying and combat together along with companions with different relationship values, and boom, you have the ideal combat roleplaying game ready to go. Even better though is the fact that whilst you can play the game solo, on your own or with a playable NPC party. You can also bring in three other players in on your campaign adventure with their own characters. The possibilities of cooperation, backstabbing, competition, friendship and the occasional bit of griefing or trolling with four human players is endless. All in all, by pure basic gameplay along, it’s utterly fantastic solo or with a group of friends. There is a catch to this though… this game can be insanely hard, at least initially. The enemy plays smart and can wipe the floor with you if you’re not careful. Once you start getting reasonable equipment, abilities and spells you start to find yourself increasingly able to slaughter your way through most of your opponents… until you hit the bigger fights and the bosses, in which case, you promptly start getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked, even on the lowest difficulty so be ready to save scum and rerun fights. Unfortunately, some quests and fights can feel just unfair at times regardless of where you are at, so be careful. The campaign for DOS 2 is deep, complex and gripping, always encouraging you to continue playing through to the end. It has excellent characters and voice acting, coupled in with an unpredictable and well-done story with multiple endings with variations. It certain stands out as a solid campaign with numerous sub quests and side stories alongside the main one, couple this in with a natural inclination to explore the map, and you soon find yourself more than happily working to complete whatever you can find. The story’s one real weakness is that it suffers Halo 4 syndrome. Anyone familiar with the series will quickly get the gist of the plot, events and characters, whilst newcomers will be left scratching their heads as they try and get a better understanding of setting. Thankfully, a lot of this is covered as you progress through the game and you will soon get an understanding of the story and setting, which is solid enough to stand on its own two feet. The campaign is strong throughout Acts 1-3 but weakens in Act 4 due to some almost unfair and annoying quests, situations and fights, but the very final segment makes up for it. I was able to complete the campaign on the easiest difficulty in about 40 hours, probably a little bit longer. You could do it quicker, but I wouldn’t recommend it if you want to have an easier time with fighting opponents. However, with multiple companions, replayability is definitely a thing with the game. I recommend playing the game at least three times. Once with your own character and three origin companions, once with the origin characters you didn’t pick and an previously used origin character of your choice and a third playthrough in Coop, so you get your money’s worth in the campaign by time alone. Now, it’s not just the campaign. The developers went a step further and adding in a competitive multiplayer versus mode called arena, where you and other players fight each other alongside a custom campaign mode called Gamemaster, where you can play campaigns made by yourself or other players. Unfortunately, at the time of this review, games with random people are almost impossible in these modes and likely the campaign too. Every match is either full, empty or has one guy AFK, so in the end, I was only able to get one arena match in. It feels much like the regular campaign, but it’s a nice thought and addition. I wasn’t even able to go and play with Gamemaster at all. So you are going to need to organise with friends to full try that out. However, they are worthy additions which will add a few more hours to the game. In addition, the art design, sound effects and the music deserve A*-grade damn rewards. This game is staggeringly beautiful to behold with excellent music through the different stages to immerse you into the world. As a bonus, the game seems free of bugs and runs well on decent computers, even very low spec PCs and laptops have been able to run it, but be careful with the lower spec PCs. I did notice that as I progressed through the campaign, I did start getting performance drops, lag and even near crashes by the time I reached the last few hours of the game, luckily though, I suffered no crashes, though I came close on occasion. Just be warned. All in all, Divinity Original Sin 2 is an utterly fantastic game that is worth every penny, even if you just play the campaign, you will get your money’s worth and it gets better with friends. If you are a fan of roleplay and strategy, and are willing to put up with the extremely difficult encounters, this game deserves a place in your library. The challenge and weaker Act 4 stops me from giving the game 10/10, but it still earns 9/10 and my own Wolfy seal of approval. I implore you to get this game. Trust me, you won’t regret it.","September 10, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
947,"D:OS2 is one of the best RPGs I have played in a really long time! The freedom to do whatever and the ""hidden"" things you can make or counteract various parts of the game make it really fun to just keep messing with. Like crafting nails with boots to make shoes that are slip proof (ice), I had no idea it would even work like that but the novelty of figuring that one out was fantastic! This game gives you the flexibility to kill anyone, and I mean anyone. You might pay for it if you aren't high enough level to attack them but you still have the chance to ink out a victory from dire straits. The conversations are rich and your dialogue can actually have a meaningful impact on your game. I would highly encourage to play coop with your friends, its a load of fun! I cannot recommend this game enough!","October 6, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
948,"I am one of those old codgers who was playing Baldur's Gate back in the day. Anyone who even remotely enjoys that kind of old-school RPG will absolutely love this game. My advice is: don't try to rush it. Initially, I got impatient, and decided to go look up how to get off Starter Island. Imagine my disgrace to find out how many ways there are to get off Starter Island. Just explore, push the envelope, connect dots, and it will happen eventually. That, in a nut shell, sums up my impression of how to succeed at this game. Early combat can be brutal. Explore, build up your gear and your abilities, learn the ropes, and you will prevail. At times, combat can seem like the whole world is on fire. Learn to master the chaos, and the enviornment, and you will crush your foes into gelatinous goo. Well... be that as it may... if you enjoy old-school RPG, if you love a good story, if you you enjoy melting your enemies into gelatinous goo, then you will not find a better title than Divinity: Original Sin 2.","September 22, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
949,"My party stumbles upon a hidden mound in a grave yard. None of them have a shovel so the lizard in my party (a prince) is relegated to uncover the grave with his claws. A disembodied lizard leg appears and my prince is given two options, ""Pick up"" and ""Eat."" Naturally I choose ""Eat."" A spirit appears and says ""You Savage! I hope you choke on me!"" giving my lizard prince a curse. I couldn't stop laughing... There is a lot of humor in this game that is on purpose and a ton that is seemingly accidental. The writing is great and the stories are enthralling. I find myself wanting to complete side quests to find out what happens rather than simply squeezing that last bit of XP. Half the time I walk around after a quest is already completed just to see if there are any additional clues as to why somebody did something. So far I am really enjoying this game. =============== Downsides: - There are a lot of bugs. I have found a lot of situations where I have to reload the game. For example; a battle where I can't loot a corpse (the arachnid in the graveyard). - More bugs. I discovered that the reason I couldn't target enemies in the Driftwood arena was because I wan't zoomed in enough. After I realized this I was able to beat the competition. - Even more bugs (getting access to a waypoint early because I was on a cliff overlooking it, which allowed me to fast-travel to the waypoint and expedite my storyline). In the end it wasn't a big deal but my quest progress leap-frogged past the initial quest giver ( I met the quest giver long after I defeated the boss).","October 9, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

957,"The first 2 out of 5 acts are marvelous and set the bar for tactical-combat, freedom of gameplay, fully, fantastically voiced dialogues (every character has a conceivable background and motivation) for rpgs to the next level. Graphic (despite the clunky character potraits) and sound are excellent and detailled. Future rpgs have let themselves to be measured on what Larian Studios achieved here. The last ~50% of the game (act3-5) sure seem a bit rushed. The magic of the first 2 acts is not entirely gone but fades until the game becomes from time to time slightly annoying in act 5. Still one of the best ""classical"" rpgs I ever played. And please change the either groupwide magic dmg or physical dmg concept. On higher difficulties it makes no sense to go with a mixed group. One form of armor should be enough.","December 16, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
958,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Fantastic gameplay, even in an alpha state. That's the short of it, the long of it is a little more complicated. This game's got a lot to offer even in an extremely unfinished state as it is, and I'll probably change my review when the next story segment comes out and likely again when the game's released as a finished product. As it stands, without voices, with missing dialogue, with missing assets, and occasional bugs, this is still a beautiful game that, while short, offers some pretty in-depth character customization, even up to level 8 or 9. The elemental effect/terrain altering magic from the first game is back, and better than ever, with a few new combinations, as well as the Bless/Curse quasi-elements that can transform an already dangerous fire patch into a lethal Cursed Flame that sets enemies or allies aflame with immolation that can't be put out with water, or transform an annoying but avoidable oil patch into Blessed Oil that fortifies allies instead of slowing them, making it a detour you WANT to walk through for a buff rather than a hindrance to walk around. I constantly found myself wondering how best to use my action points to turn terrain to my advantage rather than simply cluttering up the field with dangerous patches of fire, ooze, or electrified water. Creating characters is even more in-depth than the last game, and many of the old skills from the first game have either been changed or removed for more interesting ones. Summoning is now its own skill tree, and is best paired with spells that create environmental effects, or simply on a Lizard who can breathe a patch of flame wherever they want, as the summons, a totem and an ""Incarnate"" gain the element they're conjured on, either water, fire, poison, oil, or blood. Even with all the spells at my disposal, I still found myself favoring the weapons I'd chosen before, as even with a hundred spells at my disposal, sometimes it's nice to just smack someone with a big sword. This game can be very, VERY hard, but often in a Dark Souls way. Usually you'll know why you died, and can reload to try to fix it next time. Enemy casting a lot of fire spells? Make sure to purchase a rain scroll or use more water magic to counteract them, or simply stunlock the enemy to death and try to pick apart the enemy's strategy. It's pretty rare that you'll encounter a fight that you simply cannot win when you first encounter it, unless you go into the battle extremely underleveled (If you're more than 1 level below your opponent, you're probably going to lose). Generally fights last a while, so make sure to prepare for both long and short combats as it's rare that you'll go into a fight completely outclassing your opponent, and be prepared to burn potions and the like, as they WILL give you an edge in combat and it's generally not worth trying to tough it out without them. There's apparently an entire mechanic for food, but I've never gotten good results from it and the buffs generally arent worth the action points it takes to eat it, so you can't simply down six cheese wheels to heal to full. The storyline's not quite as good as the gameplay, sadly, but I'm pretty confident that with voice acting and some tweaks it will get far stronger. The quest journal's still hardly worth looking at unless you've totally forgotten what you've done and feel like looking through a complicated and user-unfriendly transcript of everyone you've ever spoken to. The journal could definitely use a change as it was often hard to maintain who's quests were what and with four characters with FOUR SEPARATE JOURNALS THAT OFTEN HAVE SEPARATE QUESTS it's quite difficult to keep everything straight. Thankfully it's easy to just start walking in a direction and you'll probably run into some enemies that are either your level or much, much higher, leading to a quick-reload and a different path taken. The storyline itself introduces a number of people, Dalis the Hammer, Bishop Alexandar, a blind elven seer, and far, far, FAR more, each with a complex backstory that almost everyone's happy to narrate to you at the drop of a hat, which can get a little overwhelming sometimes, but it's an inherently wordy RPG, so that's just par for the course. The story's tone is classic Larian, with a serious and epic plot that tries to be grim and po-faced when the rest of the world is made up of goofy talking skulls, riddling rats, mad witches, puns, and adorable dog quest-givers. Although the main storyline ends up looking a little out-of-place, it's nice that it's there and that the game's not simply a permanent comedy routine. I will say that some will find the tone kind of schizophrenic, and although I'd agree with that I'd also say that it's not a game to be taken seriously, and is instead more a sandbox for one or more players can wreak havoc or play within the rules. Character customization is a little lacking at the moment, but that's almost secondary compared to the great animations each race/gender has, as well as each armor set looking different on each race, with an emphasis on eastern cloth for Lizards, or a hardier iron look for Dwarves. Spells have intricate and impressive effects, even for basic spells such as ""Throw a rock"" or ""hit someone extra hard."" While the hairdos and facial options presented to each race and gender is pretty small, it's generally enough that you probably won't get your characters confused. On an entirely different note, the game's graphics and representation is amazing. I love the vibrant colors, and beautiful tropical locale for the start of the game. The one big downside is that the first part of the game takes place in a giant prison, but the atmosphere is that of a tropical resort, with sunny skies, beautiful coral beaches, and a shanty-town that looks more like a run-down tourist town than a brutal gulag for wizards. Although it wouldn't be nearly as pretty to look at, it would have been nice to have a more oppressive environment to start in, and escape to the tropical paradise later on, for contrast. That being said, the shadow effects playing off trees and logs, and the drop dead gorgeous beaches make for an impressive opening, and when the future chapters of the game are released, I'll be most excited to see the environments they take place in. To sum it all up, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. Worth a look if you enjoy slower-paced RPGs, even though the storyline's only about 1/3rd complete. With almost all of its flaws coming from being an unfinished alpha and very few coming from the actual design or gameplay. Pretty much fun in every aspect, with an insane level of combat and character customization depth, this game is absolutely worth your time.","May 15, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

986,"Product received for free I'm just writing a very brief review, in no way am I actually giving this game justice with my words, but I feel I have to write something as this game has consumed my life for the past 4 or 5 days. Let's get started with the fact that I have not played any of the previous Divinity games, however I am a huge fan of CRPGs, stemming from the time I originally sat down and played the Dungeons and Dragons dungeon crawler: Pool of Raidiance - Ruins of Myth Drannor. Since that time I had backtracked, played through Neverwinter 1 and 2, though never actually completing them, as well as Wasteland, the Fallout series, pretty much most of the 'mainstream' crpgs most people are familiar with. A few days ago a friend tossed me this game as a gift, honestly I am very thankful as this game has breathed new life into my fascination to this genre. From the get go, the game is not forgiving, if you ignore obvious signs, you will die. Even on the normal difficulties if you lack in perception, the game has no qualm about stamping your expectations in the dust. And even if you are paying attention, it still does so. The way it handles ground effects, along with most spells being aoe, and actually having an impact. So you better think twice about casting that poison spell with your undead mage because he may be low health, but you may end up be using 3 resurrection scrolls instead of just one. Or you may send the dominoes of chaos smashing together to kill literally everything on the battlefield, as well as yourself. Difficulty doesn't spike horribly though, once you get the hang of things, it's actually a breeze if you're used to any kind of tactics, especially in classic mode. Though I give credit to the enemy AI. There are times they are smarter than their own good, geeking the mage rather than going after my tanky knight front and center. However this is a downside as well, because if my undead is under an enchantment to appear for all intensive purposes, as an elf. How yould you know it was undead to cast that heal spell on it? But I digress, I have 60 hours in the game, I had finally after a lot of exploration started exploring the place after the initial island, and I am loving the game even more. Again, this isn't even half of my feelings, there are obviously some negatives, but they have already been stated by someone else, or I feel they are not an issue. I heartily reccomend, I got it as a gift, and I actually wish I had been able to buy it myself.","September 24, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

The difficulty of battle and the thought that goes into strategy of it all is incredible, although i am biased since i am a huge fan of turn based fights. Can be a bit infuriating at first since most fights you'll get into at first will pretty much destroy you until you get a handle on how it all works.

I have found myself stopped playing 2 times and just listening the soundtrack cause i think it might change if i enter other area. This has not happen to me since Final Fantasy 10. -NPCs are really well written and voice acted. I was amazed by Fane, The Red Prince and the Assasin dude in the beginning. Thats my 3 people party btw. -Turn based combat is really good. It is also challenging even on the lowest level on difficulty. -Game looks amazing with max graphic settings. The water makes me wanna jump in there and swim. -Quests and their completion is done really well. Not one quest feels like a chore and there is actually no direct markings on the map on where to go. It might show you a location of a NPC or location but the rest you have to figure out by yourself. Really nice oldschool vibe init. -I have only been out of the tutorial island and it took me 17 hours. I cant imgaine how much content there is for the rest of the game. Cons: -Battle might be frustrating in the beginning if you are not familiar with the skills. It took me several attemps on several quests on the normal mode until my party was not demolished by the mobs. This is not really a bad thing cause we need more games that makes us learn the gameplay and try our best but i understand it might frustrate some poeple. -Camera. Camera is pain if you try to change the view all the time but you have to do it in order to loot everything. It takes some time to get used to. Overall this game is really amazing. It gives me this deep athmospere like when i furst used to play Arcanum or Icewind dale. Totally recommended.","October 21, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

995,"I'm playing this multiplayer with my friends and it is really way more fun than it should be. Combat misadventures to follow, but the story interaction that you can have is fantastic. If one player starts talking to an NPC you can listen to the whole exchange as well, complete with the voice acted NPC dialog. You can see where your friend's cursor is as they debate what dialog choice they want to reply with- we always end up talking about which one fits our ""attitude"" the most, which is fun in and of itself. You are never standing around while someone has an awesome dialog with ""their"" quest NPC while you do nothing; you can always listen in and hear the story. Now on to the combat. The combat is really well done, especially the environmental variables and conditions. For instance, the classic Divinity situation of use lightning or cold on someone standing in water or wet and they will be stunned or frozen respectively is great for planning out how you are going to take on a group of enemies. Until someone in your group makes it rain on the battlefield and then uses chain lightning. Now, in addition to your foe being stunned, your allies are as well. I am not saying that I have been stunned or frozen a few times, but I have been stunned or frozen a few times. Lots of quests and side quests and NPCs to do tasks for, and lots of different ways of completing the tasks as well. We are still in our first play-through but already planning out classes for our second. One of the short comings is related to the quests, specifically the quest log. It can be difficult to discern if a quest is active only because you did a part of it out of order, such as visiting an NPC before you should have, or if you have not done the criteria of the quest. It is not game braking but it is a little bit out of place due to how good the rest of the game is, UI included.","November 26, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
996,"After quite some time I am getting the Dragon Age Origins rpg feel from any game, the 1st game was very good, but this feels great. I have not went too deep into the game yet but it already feels great, and after full voice acting support I think they aced it pretty much. I like how open-ended the game has been so far. Great Race-Class system Fully Voice Acted Playable Undead Race Great Music Great Combat System (specially if you are into turn based combat) Downside so far for me is the running around I have to do to get back a party member once I let go of them. I think once they join your party and you ask them to leave they all should wait at a specific location not back to where you found them. If you loved Dragon Age Origins and also loved X-COM then this game is provides the fun of both worlds in my opinion. 9/10 for me.","September 16, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

A definitive must have for fans of the Fantasy genre and RPG nuts. The music help set's the scene and fits in beautifully with the game. The AI is rather smart and can be quite difficult to overcome in some battles but persistence is a key.

I strongly recommend that anyone who's a fan of RPGs the way they used to be should check out this game. You won't be disappointed.","October 2, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

Things ALWAYS went wrong, someone always said the wrong thing, or stole the wrong thing or attacked the wrong person. Haven't had so much enjoyable chaos in an RPG that I can ever remember.

1004,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW This game has the potential to become a masterpiece. It has all the strenghts of the first game`s Enhanced Edition, offers turn-based combat and plenty elemental interactions (make it rain, aoe stun through blitz bolt - create a fire surface, throw poison onto it for a huge explosion etc.). You can play with up to four party members and can either create your own character or take one of the four (after full release six) pre-made characters. While the first game lacked in the story, this 2nd part is much better in this regard. It has a much darker tone and so far the story delivers fully. It is grim, entertaining and really complex. Also the possibility of party dialogue and getting different results when talking with different party members to certain NPCs enlagerns its richness in this regard. But the strogest point of Divinity Origial Sin has always been its combat system. And the second part adds more features to that and makes everything even better. You now have aroumr fore physical and magic damage, which you have to break first in order to inflict status elements like stunned or burning or knocked down. Also there is a height system now, that your ranged characters can use for greater range and more damage. And last but not least the game has after the full release on the 14th of September a Game Master Mode. There you can basically develop and play your own adventures with the Divinity engine and UI. With this you can create your own D&D - campaign and play it with your friends. Another small feature is the Arena Mode, where you can explore the combat system with pre-defined characters on several maps. All this features offer easy access to multiplayer, I have atm ver 250 hours into this already great game and multiplayer worked fine every time. I regard Divinity Original Sin 2 in the highest order. This game was highly enjoyable already in its year in Early Access although it missed some of its features. Full release is now only two weeks away and if you like calssic RPGs which give you a challenging gameplay, try this game out. If you are into turn - based combat and tactical RPGs, you will find a great time here.

1005,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Even now in Early Access, this game is both beautiful, as well as beautifully complex and challenging; compared to the first installment, D:OS 2 takes all the strengths of its predecessor and builds on the weaknesses -- we now have Origin Characters with their own backstories on top of optionally completely custom characters, and not just these Origin Character's individual stories, but also the main, overarching story has received much more attention and love than in the first game. We can also choose between the races of Human, Lizard, Elves, Dwarfs and, my personal favorite, the Undead; whatever you choose, rest assured that even just your race will have an effect on how you're viewed and treated in the world of D:OS 2. On top of all of this, Larian has even dared to go completely beyond the conventional by implementing a fully-fledged Game Master Mode -- a feature which to me is extremely interesting, allowing up to five players to enjoy customly created campaigns as a group of up to four adventurers and one Game Master, to create the virtual equivalent of the good old Pen & Paper roleplaying experience. All in all, this has every chance of becoming not just the best RPG of this year, but also one of the best RPGs period.","August 20, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

I sort of scouted ahead with quite a few quests to make sure I got the most XP and rewards as I could. In the end that doesn't really matter. You will manage to get where you need to go anyway. Play the game and make the decisions on the go, don't reload too often to alter your decisions. It makes it so much more fun to do a second playthrough that way and trust me: you're gonna want to do a second playtrhough.

D:OS2 also comes with a gamemaster mode for you to make quick and easy campaigns, editable on the fly by the game master, which you can play with friends. Additionally, as a separate download, the devs made the tools that they used ot make the main campaign available for us to use. As the game ages and people have time, I'm sure we will see some epic user-made campagins. These games are a labour of love - the developers almost went bankrupt while making the first D:OS, but they still pushed on.

1025,"I purchased, but didn't log a ton of hours in the remastered first iteration of this game (36 hrs), but this 2nd one just feels right, and it's a homerun for Larian. I will start by saying I have only experienced the co-op of this game, which so far has been a load of fun to play with a good friend: Areas to highlight: The story telling is vastly improved, with exceptional voice dialogue (gaming industry wise). There are a ridiuclous amount of options for dialogue depending on your characters skills and tags. Rich orchestra sounds bring you back to some of your favorite RPGs of old. The game is gorgeous too, graphics are superb. Scenes are incredibly detailed, from brightly lit beach environments to dark, dreary dungeons. The mood is dark and sombre overall but clever writing adds in humor all along the way. HUD is intuitive and nothing new, co-op shared backpack screen is something to behold; very convenient. The combat is intuitive but high on difficulty, Larian does not hold your hand in this one. There are major things in the game that are not obvious which I won't spoil, and without the internet you'd miss a lot. Highly recommend playing without reading up on the game, it makes for a much better/realer experience. Those new to this type of game will repeat battles many times over on the harder difficulties. This is Turn-Based though, at it's best. Re-trying is half the fun, learning from your previous mistakes becomes essential. Winning a battle on the first go after using perfect tactics really feels satisfying. Areas for Improvement: We encountered minor bugs, a learned spell that wouldn't show up in the mage book, finishing a successful dialogue with a creature then clicking them again by accident only to have new dialogue that leads to a fight. Stuff that requires a reload but isn't game breaking, and occurs infrequently. The environment manipulation is incredible, and no other game has allowed players to control fights so well using it, however it becomes a bit too much at times with the blood, water and other puddles--often making magic-type characters useless since every attack hurts your friends and foes alike. Source spells are a great idea but would be nice to be able to use once per battle or game day. Current game makes it hard to accumulate source points for skills that truthfully really arent as impressively OP as they should be at that rarity. Lastly, the gold/bartering system needs a hotfix bad. You need to move a slider to hit exact gold value on both sides, without an option to go up by 1 or type in a value. This is a basic that has been overlooked. Summary: I look forward to logging many more hours before updating this review (so far at around 30 hrs). Recommended for anyone who loves old-school (or new) cRPGs or any 1-4 group of friends looking for a great game to co-op, just note it requires much focus, dialogue/reading and chatting, so I wouldn't recommend playing with a stranger. Also be prepared for 4 hr+ play times. It is almost impossible to make any progress in 1-2 hr playings. Congrats to Larian on a job well done, it's been one of the better RPG games I have played in years. I would score D:OS2 9/10.","September 15, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

1031,"The first 2 out of 5 acts are marvelous and set the bar for tactical-combat, freedom of gameplay, fully, fantastically voiced dialogues (every character has a conceivable background and motivation) for rpgs to the next level. Graphic (despite the clunky character potraits) and sound are excellent and detailled. Future rpgs have let themselves to be measured on what Larian Studios achieved here. The last ~50% of the game (act3-5) sure seem a bit rushed. The magic of the first 2 acts is not entirely gone but fades until the game becomes from time to time slightly annoying in act 5. Still one of the best ""classical"" rpgs I ever played. And please change the either groupwide magic dmg or physical dmg concept. On higher difficulties it makes no sense to go with a mixed group. One form of armor should be enough.","December 16, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

Not only that these characters can be any class you chose for them. Perhaps Ifan is a rogue style fighter when you don't play as him, but if you pick him, why not a mage or a grand warrior. This is the style of freedom you have. The story too is deep and rewarding. Allowing to generally play as you wish. Skip ahead come back avoid quests it is up to you.

1035,"20 ways to accomplish almost all of the tasks. Some you can eff up and not be able to do and must approach another way. Hell, maybe you even ruined that ability to DO this task now. You can't Skyrim it and toss your face into the brick wall over and over, or follow an arrow that coddles you till you win with confetti. There are loads of combinations for character builds to START with. Yes, start with. You can absolutely change things up later on. Play a sword-and-board warrior with no spells...but realize that raising the dead and slinging lightning is hella boss? Cool, pump a point or two into those stats so you can use spells. I haven't even GOTTEN FAR ENOUGH yet, but heard there is a way to respec your characters entirely eventually. So don't worry about grinding new gameplays to get what you want. Though...that's not always bad, since there are so many outcomes to every single encounter in this game that you can't see everything in one go. Loads-a-loot, too. You'll be literally defending yourself with wooden planks roped into a sheild, and knives on a a stick (that's the actual crafted name) and work your way to legendary and unique weapons to genuinely suck the life from enemies and light them on fire. PS, seamless multiplayer in a free-roam/turn-based game that has damn near no limitiations I've seen so far. No rope sticking MP members together at all times. Travel wherever you want, talk, fight, etc...and don't worry about snagging your buddy away from his task to join you; they have freedom even when you are a world away fighting.

1036,"I am one of those old codgers who was playing Baldur's Gate back in the day. Anyone who even remotely enjoys that kind of old-school RPG will absolutely love this game. My advice is: don't try to rush it. Initially, I got impatient, and decided to go look up how to get off Starter Island. Imagine my disgrace to find out how many ways there are to get off Starter Island. Just explore, push the envelope, connect dots, and it will happen eventually. That, in a nut shell, sums up my impression of how to succeed at this game. Early combat can be brutal. Explore, build up your gear and your abilities, learn the ropes, and you will prevail. At times, combat can seem like the whole world is on fire. Learn to master the chaos, and the enviornment, and you will crush your foes into gelatinous goo. Well... be that as it may... if you enjoy old-school RPG, if you love a good story, if you you enjoy melting your enemies into gelatinous goo, then you will not find a better title than Divinity: Original Sin 2.","September 22, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
1037,"Prior to Original Sin (the first one) i was not into ""old-school"" RPGs at all and the turn based combat really did seem like it could get boring, but as soon as i began playing i totally fell in love with the series and the gameplay, the Turn-Based combat really allows for great strategic depth and especially in Original Sins 2 it does not feel to slow/boring at all. Also most of the improvements to core gameplay mechanics made since the Original really make the game look overall more polished and challenging. I can therefore really recommend this game to everyone who is into RPG-type games or tactical combat as these surely are its strengths, Be aware though that the higher difficultys (e.g. Tactician) especially require you to really use the game's systems such as crafting to get through resonably easy, that said the game certainly will make you die a few times anyway.","September 23, 2017","2 people found this review helpful

1043,"I'm a simple man, I see my favourite Belgian games developer and I upvote... No really, this game is great. This game feels and plays like the more classic RPG's of the past. Just look at games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights and Larians own Divine Divinity and you'll know what I'm on about. The first Original Sin was good, but this is something else, something more polished and fun to play. Unlike many newer RPG's, this game doens't have that much handholding. It lets you explore the world and figure out things by yourself without much obvious spoonfeeding. Also, your actions have some weight on how things play out. Don't save a seemingly unimportant NPC early on and it might come back to bite you later on. The world itself is quite interactable. Not only are there loads of things lying around for you to rummage through and steal. There are also plenty of environmental effects like puddles of water or blood giving you the chance of electrifiying it and anyone standing in it. Oil can be lit aflame, as does poison. You can let it rain to douse the flames, creating steam. Obviously your characters will also get wet because of the rain. A campfire will then again warm up your characters. All these effects are certainly fun to mix up and don't feel that gimmicky like in the first Original Sin. Lastly and quite importantly: the inhabitants of the world feel quite alive, the story unfolds nicely, the dialogue is top notch and your party members are delightfully in depth. Highly recommended for any RPG lover. Otherwise still a rock solid game.","September 29, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

1052,"Well, after ending this game w/ a friend, i can tell, this is probabally the best game i ever played, for real, a very deep and involving story with a various number of characters with their own history and game decisions and background histories too. In this game you will spend A LOTS of hours playing, trying, retrying, reading, discovering, stealing, hating some npcs, you will find some very nice plots. The gameplay is really fluid, even for those whom dont like turned based games, you adapt with the system of fight in a time of an eye blink. I need to say, GET THIS GAME, mainly if you are tha kind of player who likes the lore, believe me, this game have and awesome lore rich in details, i really wish they made another Divinty, surelly me and my friends would pre-buy.

1059,"I play RPGs for the story. I play strategy games for the tactical puzzles. In RPGs, the combat is (at best) an okay distraction between story points, and if there's a role-playing way to avoid a fight, I'll usually take it. In strategy games, the story is a thin trope-ridden veneer I mostly ignore. Then along comes the DOS games. The only RPGs with a story I really really WANT to finish, alongside fights I will make a detour to take on. I'll still avoid fights with persuasion and roleplaying when I can, because I like the immersion and playing a clever character, but in DOS2, I'll loop back after obtaining my objective, plant as many barrels of oil and ooze I can find next to the enemy I conned into letting me run around, and then light them up like a roman candle before taking them down. There's some good funny moments. Some gory creepy moments. Some really really hard moments (yikes, the crucial reveal in Lohse's story GUTTED me - it even gutted the hard-case who was guiding me on that quest, that's saying something as to how heartwrenching a choice needs to be made). And there's moments when you finally kill someone who's been irritating you for awhile by turning him into a chicken before giving him a final whack and shouting IN YOUR FACE as he explodes or something. Ahhh, good times, good times.... (Edited to remove potential light spoiler from Lohse's quest, never know...)",October 2,2 people found this review helpful

1061,"There are already a ton of reviews that say everything (both bad and good) that has to be said about the game, so let me tell you a story instead. Dreamy Hair Coco There once was a dwarf named Dreamy Hair Coco, who despite his name, had naught a single hair on his head. All journeys begin with a goal, and thus Dreamy Hair Coco decided that his would be to find luscious hair befitting of his scalp, and name. Alas, nothing ever goes according to what one desires, and thus begins a story like no other. Captured as a Sourcerer during his journey, he would quickly find himself tossed into a conflict spanning ages...a devious plot decades in the making that threatened to change everything he knew. However, he was not alone. He would meet others who held the same power in them like him. They were - Sebille, an elf ranger who read a guide before the game released so he would know the highest damage build to play as and constantly shove it in their faces. Boner Bagins, the red lizard prince mage who is every bit as stupid as you would imagine him to be from his name. and Gloks, the undead warrior, ""I hate your god damn guts Gloks **** you."" Together, they would set out to save the world - as Godwokens. Saving the world was not going to be an easy task by any means. The Voidwoken were ruthless in their assault, and all manners of evil were at their foulest. However - the hardest task Dreamy Hair Coco would come upon, was trying to rescue the world with three idiots of the highest calibur. Arriving on land after being stuck in the tutorial ship for an hour because someone would keep attacking every single guard thinking it's funny, they would eventually make their way to Fort Joy where they would have to find a way out of the dastardly place in order to embrace their fate as Godwoken. Instead, Sebille started whining about how no one had thievery so they couldn't get any spellbooks and that the game was too hard, and Boner Bagins, the grandest of the lizard mages, would proceed to kill his companions over and over and over due to friendly fire. Gloks, seemingly innocent in all of this, would slowly start to reveal his true nature as time went on... It was not all bad however, as Dreamy Hair Coco would eventually find a skillbook called Medusa Head, that enabled him to temporarily sprout snake-like hair. While not what he had in mind, he was at least making headway on his goal. It wasn't until he finally met his god and was told that of all the Godwokens, only one may be Divine however, that he decided that he would be the one to claim that namesake and the power that came with it, so that his ultimate wish would finally be granted. After a gruelling battle with Alexander, they would board the Lady Vengeance and make their way to the Reaper's Coast, where they would have to learn to wield and master the power that is in them. However, things finally took a turn for the worse - Sebille's crying finally made Dreamy Hair Coco lose the last of the precious strands of hair that he had, and he would get Thievery. Things were fine for a while - everyone got their skillbooks, and even new equipment. They were strong; they could handle anything thrown at them now. However, such power has a price...and Dreamy Hair Coco, oh so noble and bald, would fall prey to what being a thief means - he would end up stealing from every single person he came across, delaying their journey and forcing reloads left and right because he would anger entire villages at once. Sebille, realizing the monster he had created in his incessant whining (and realizing how much time they were wasting each day), tried to convince Dreamy Hair Coco to see the light again. Dreamy Hair Coco, once so noble but always so bald, would hear the plea of his friend, and swore to steal no longer from that day forth. Gloks however, had other plans. Having seen the profits Dreamy Hair Coco was making and sharing with them, decided that he would pick up Thievery without telling anyone. A journey of this magnitude is when you truly find yourself and Gloks found out what he was - a piece of **** ****ing greedy *** ************. In the meantime, during all of this, Boner Bagins learned a secret talent that only someone of his exact stature, name, and prestige could gain - He gained the ability to die in every battle no matter what and be utterly useless. With newfound resolve, gear, greed, and skill, the four would continue on their journey and become masters of the Source, leaving behind Reaper's Coast and coasting through the rest of their journey on the Nameless Isle. Unfortunately, the bumps on a road never end, and soon, they would face a new crisis unlike any other... Boner Bagins, having practically no use in any of the fights for a long time now, and ensuring that every fight that started was with him on the enemies' side, was getting angry at Sebille's constant bragging. Wanting to share in the spotlight as Gloks, who was stealing equipment and exploiting the gold-bag trick (and denying it as a real thief would), was also starting to contribute his fair share during a fight while Dreamy Hair Coco was dreamy and thus always useful - Boner Bagins would decide that the arcane arts were no longer for him and that he was destined to be a rogue instead. Hearing the winds chattering his name and the cries of his daggers thirsting for the blood of his enemies, he would fully embrace his new-found role as if it was his very birthright to begin with, never losing a beat as he transitioned from bright burning fires to the darkness of the shadows. With agility like a fox and reflexes like a mongoose, Sadly, he still died constantly and stayed useless for the rest of the story. Finally arriving at Arx, and ultimately the final battle, all that they had learned about themselves and each other would be put to the test here...but as if guided by the hand of fate, Dreamy Hair Coco would find himself the last one standing just as when they were so close to bringing it all to a closure. With his last ounce of strength, Dreamy Hair Coco unleashed everything he had, and...he did it, it was all over. As his companions lay lifeless around him, there was only one person who could ascend and become Divine - him. As he sat down on the throne; His throne, and made his wish, he realized that getting to grow hair wasn't an option as a Divine and he had to pick one of three boring options instead. ""Sigh"", he thought to himself, ""Guess I better get a wig"". As he braced for the conclusion of it all, to see what his choice had yielded for the world he had fought so hard for, he realized his companions weren't actually lifeless and were talking among themselves. ""Hey, why can't I see the god damn cutscene?"" said one of them. ""WTF IS THIS BUGGY♥♥♥♥♥♥GAME I CAN'T DO ANYTHING"" said another. Realizing that he was Divine now however, he ignored them and went on to view the world that would come to pass under his rule. It was in this instance however, that he would finally realize all along that there was already a true Divine. One who held power over everything, yet seemingly always weak and frail. It was none other than Boner Bagins, who controlled the save game file. He would shut the server down and log off instantly, having finally gotten tired of it all. None of them would ever get a chance to see what happened in the end. As for Dreamy Hair Coco...well, some say that he finally realized the existence of the Face Ripper and could have just made hair that way, or that he embraced his Medusa Head look. Whatever the case is...Larian please fix that god damn cut scene at the end cutting out halfway if someone shuts down the server god damn it I don't want to play through the game again to see what the hell happens at the end. Thanks.","October 13, 2017","2 people found this review helpful

1064,"This is my first review, so I'm going to give it the ol college try. Pro: Interesting characters. Decisions matter. You dont need to have played D:OS1 to enjoy this game. Players of D:OS1 will have some easter eggs. Lighthearted and dark at the same time. Voiced narrator and characters (every RPG needs one, once you go voiced you cant go back to reading blocks of texts) Con: Some bugs and performance issues. some sadness at the end (the kind that you get after finishing a really good book with no immediate sequels) This is one of those games that by the time the credits roll, you want to give the devs a standing ovation. P.S: if you want front row seats to the main story use Fane as your main character. If you want an amazing/rich and personal story, pick Lohse. If you want a revenge/redemption tale, pick Ifan/Sebille/Beast If you want to experience a disgraced noble's rise to power pick The red prince.",January 7,2 people found this review helpful

1085,"I took a bit of a punt on this game. I hadn’t played the original and I’ve never really had much of an interest in Baldur’s Gate style RPGs. But a couple of friends were really enjoying it and I was suffering from PUBG fatigue so I went ahead and bought it a few weeks after its release. I’m really glad I did! The first thing I liked was that it doesn’t require you to have played the first game to understand what is going on. It doesn’t assume knowledge of characters, events or setting. Everything comes at you in the context of the world you are in. The RPG elements are easy to get to grips with. There are a massive number of skills to learn and I found that my party almost organically grew into distinct classes. I ended up with a warrior, a ranger, a wizard and an assassin. But I never felt like I was limited to a class because of the choices I’d made. I started to give my warrior some magical skills mid-way through my current playthrough and it works. Weapon and armour stats are simple too. The bigger the numbers, the better the item. I like that simplicity. That's not to say there is no depth. You'll often need to compromise between armours physical strength defence and magical strength defence for example. And a weapon may give you buffs and skills that the high level shiny sword you've just looted does not. The world is massive. At the time of writing I’ve put in about 80 hours and I think I’m a little over half way through the game. At times the game can be a little intimidating. On arriving in a new area you can find yourself picking up quest after quest after quest. That many of these quests are not signposted on your map means you’re going to have to read the description to figure out where to go and what to do. I have quite a short attention span and so having to force myself to pay attention to the details and to keep referring to my log book was an interesting challenge that, somewhat surprisingly, I found I liked a lot. The turn based combat reminds me a lot of the first two Fallout games, right down to the number of moves you can make being displayed as circular ‘pips’. Fights are genuinely thrilling encounters where tactics will play a huge part in your winning (or losing) a battle. High ground confers a damage bonus. Different spells will interact with one another to produce (often unwanted) side effects. I’ve found myself having to sacrifice party members in a fight for a strategic advantage. The same fight might play out in different ways depending on how you approach it. Some fights can be avoided altogether if you’re a quick talker! The biggest problem I have with the game is almost a contradiction of what I like about the game. It encourages you to explore. Very little is laid out for you. You need to learn the games mechanics and your path through its world yourself. Your choices are not restrictive. However, I did get to a point, early on, where it felt like I was being constrained to a certain path through the world because so many of the combat situations I was getting into were unwinnable. A couple of turns against the AI and I was dead. This was slightly frustrating as it meant a good deal of trial and error and quite a bit of backtracking. Ultimately it felt like a waste of time. But the counter argument is that it falls in line with the games mechanics. It does not lead you from one point to the next. You have to figure stuff out for yourself. So yes, I’m very happy I picked this up and would absolutely recommend it, certainly from the position of someone who is perhaps typically more into action games than RPGs. I’ll definitely be picking up the original Divinity once I finally finish this game.","November 27, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

My biggest Con: - Substantial UI Changes from Divinity: Original Sin that may take some time to get used to. It doesn't always feel like the most natural or intuitive system. My biggest Pro: + The storytelling between different characters/companions is always unique. Dialogue options make a difference in how they interact with you, and how the entire game unfolds. I also love the new classes and spells they've added since Original Sin I. This game has come a long way from when I first purchased it in Early Access. Back then it already felt like a full game and a fascinating environment that I would be happy to spend hours in, and yet the development team continues to update and polish their game. It just keeps getting better, and more fleshed out as they reach their release date. If you were a fan of Divinity: Original Sin, you'd be a fool not to give this a try for two hours to see if you like it.","September 9, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
1091,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Though it's still in beta, the game really attracts me with its special way of fighting. I've never played Original Sin 1, but it is truly a nice RPG game. It's a turn-based game, u'd better know that before buying it. But don't just say, ""I don't like turn-based games."" U'd better watch videos about this game, then u'll find it much different from that u imagined before. When out of fights, u'll control your team like in the game Dungeon Siege, only when fighting the enemy will u control your team in a turn-based way. Also, I really enjoyed the beautiful views a lot, u'll know what I mean when u truly play the game. This game is fantastic for me. Looking forward to play all chapters of it. But there are also some bad things to tell u. There r no marks on the map which show u where u can finish your mission. And u cant see the characters from about 2 screen's distence. That means u have to go to every corner and use your mouse to see NPCs' names. This will truly take players a lot of time unless they remember where the NPC is on receiving the mission. This game is very expensive, I know that, but it's worth buying for those who r interested in turn-based games. I really don't want to see red comments like"" why is this game turn-based? I spent fu*** over 40 dollars for this rubbish?"" That's your problem! Why don't u look at the introduction before buying it? I love this game, but also hope that after this beta, they'll add some more languages. we all hope to enjoy the game in a much easier way. Many Chinese players bought this game.

I love specifically Fane and Lfan the most but all of the characters are this fantastic dichotomy of being terrible people yet relatable people that seem like thier actions are primarily tainted by being on the wrong side of a ""very bad day"". i think they did aslightly better job of making it somewhat apparent where and what you needed to do from the get go and the ""tutorial"" section on the ship is great, playing throught the turtorial is drastically better than a pile of exposition to tell you how to play an RPG from the ground up. Im not 100% sold on the new skill system as better, but it certainly is fluid and doent punish you as harshly for side speccing, i also like that crafting does not require skill investment and that the ""Civil"" skills have been split off so you dont have to try to choose between skewering harder or not sounding like a neanderthal in conversation. I do however wish crafting seemed more impactful at low levels .... custom crafting your weapons and getting ahead of the curve through exploration theft and smart trading was quite fun in OS1. i find that somewhat removed in OS2 and most crafting early game is primarily for ""consumables"" and the customization of old on your own crafted weapons seems somewhat limited (using essences to add a damage type) the introduction of more playable character races is a welcome change and the tag system really amps up the replayability to 11. I definitely agree with the sentiment its one of the best game sof the year quite possibly the best yet.","October 10, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
1098,"Comparable and possibly exceedingly so to Fallout and Fallout 2, in complexity, depth, and approaches to the game. Expansive world, incredible single player and multiplayer experience. Absolutely worth the buy if you enjoy character and story driven RPGs. Combat is in depth, but I will update my review upon delving fully into the combat system. It is out of all the games I've purchased recently, the most rewarding for the money I spent in time and enjoyment its given me, and I'm not even finished with the game. Far from it. If you enjoyed Fallout, Fallout 2, The Elder Scrolls series, and other deep RPG's that modern RPG's have moved away from, with all the polish and modern tech of a triple A game, definitely give Divinity 2: Original Sin a go. You won't regret it.","December 28, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

1102,"This game is a masterpiece. Literally. If someone would make a book out of this story, it would be a bestseller by far. Far better than any other games I've played. You get to know each character of your group and every actions you make WILL impact future quests. I could talk hours and hours about that magnificient game, but I don't have time for that. I'd rather play this over and over and over again. The Soundtrack is amazing, and after playing 80hrs, listening to any song brings nostalgia. Each time I log back on this game, I wish I havn't played it already to revive this awesome story. If you play the game like it should be played and you actually care for the dialogs, which are f**cking awesome btw, there's between 60/80 hours of play time ahead. 11/10. Thanks for making this game. I hope there's another one upcoming.","October 1, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
1103,"Absolutely incredible. Basically feels like going from Baldur's Gate 1 to 2 (though not quite, since that was continuing from low level to midrange and then to epic levels with the same narrative, and this is not that), since the new armor system involves you either taking advantage or PEELING off layers of armor before you can actually do things. Positioning and elemental manipulation are somehow even more important this time around. Fortunately, a lot of the difficult encounters are not initiated until you finish a dialog, so one has plenty of time to position the party as one sees fit. The original one was an amazing game that I spent hundreds of hours on, but never actually finished. This so far is shaping up to be an even more impressive experience that I will revisit over and over. That being said, it is slightly disappointing that the premade dwarf character has extremely little relevance to the plot until the 4th act, and then it is tangential. Oh well.","October 15, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
1104,"Yes at the time of posting this review i am only 6.1 hours into it. I've also not made it past Fort Joy (the beginning right after the tutorial) yet as ive repeatedly restarted, playing around with different builds and such. But i am having a fantastic time with it. i havent enjoyed an RPG so much since Dragon Age Origins, nor have i wanted to smash my screen so much since initially discovering the Dark Souls games. I havent really played the first even though i own it so im not sure how it compares but i just might have to go play though it after this one. Thank God for autosave, whether it be trying to survive an underground fight club at level 2-3 or dying to teleporting crocodiles, it has come in handy many times already. I cant comment on the storyline so much yet as i havent really gotten into it yet but the origin stories seem interesting and custimization (even for origin characters) is fantastic. In short if you enjoy RPG's and dont want to button smash your way to victory but actually use some strategy than this game is for you. You get a real feeling of accomplishment when you finally beat those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teleporting crocodiles after 30-45 mins and 5-6 reloads. Oh and graphics/optimization seem to be pretty great too, am running on max settings with no lag nor have come across any bugs as of yet although i still have a ways to go obviously.

I also liked the main story more than the one from D:OS. Graphics are fine, the soundtrack is great. The round based combat sometimes requires patience, especially with larger groups and enemies who are able to charm or cripple your characters. But it works. There are still some bugs which hopefully will be fixed over time.","November 7, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

Exploring the world is immersive and makes use of your characters' skills. Your guy who can grow wings and fly around the battlefield can do this just as easily out of combat. Leads to feeling free when exploring around. Ever play an rpg where you wonder why your party sits and listens to the villain monologue and then lets him take the first shot? You can do that, or you can shoot first. You can shoot (almost) anyone first. You monster. Combat is turn based and you can pull off some fairly genius moves, cheese tactics, and many things in between. The fights get a little bonkers towards the end, but it's not intolerable. And mods.

1123,"I've got to say that after 200 hours of experiencing this game and trying out different means of playing, I've encountered an experience like no other. It is obvious that the developers of this game have put in their hearts to making a game that best suits the wants of a community of tired gamers who just wanted the freedom to make decisions, to customize their gameplay, and have a fully immersive story all along the way. Not only that, but this game will introduce you to new and interesting game mechanics that are both a pleasure to play with and against. When things go wrong in the game, you can't help but laugh it off because you are fully aware that your faults lay in your own mistakes or lack of understanding about certain core mechanics. However frustrated you may get at something or upset with yourself for having made some mistake, the game is interesting and engaging enough to motivate you to try again and learn from your mistakes. This game is definitely a must buy for any rpg lover. If there is one thing I can hope to see in the future, it is official DLC. I would love to experience new classes, new abilities, new gear, and new stories. It would be nice to have a playthrough of the ""enemy's"" side since even many of the enemies can be misunderstood or mislead. Also, a story revolving around the races that aren't present in this game could make for more gameplay and story without taking away from the existing one. Finally, more emphasis on the cooking/crafting system would be warranted. As it stands, crafting is not very important as you can find everything that is craftable and more. One of the only important recipes you need to know: Shoes + Nails = saved lives.",February 3,2 people found this review helpful
1124,"Product received for free EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Divinity original sin 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Divinity original sin. Divinity 2 is currently in early access with the 1st chapter in the campaign available for play. This first chapter has 8 - 12 hours of gameplay currently with more to come. You have the option to either create your own character or use a character with an origin created for you. The character creation and class system is awesome. So many options are available to you that initially it was a struggle for me to pick one. I havent planned out this many playthroughs in a game personally before even starting since skyrim. I was personally torn between an assassin styled character or a wizzard. Ended up going with wizzard cause I get to blow stuff up! Divinity 2 has a very beautifully crafted world with a rather deep storyline. It will require you taking the time to read it and some of the character interactions are still a little fuzzy due to it being early access but you can already see how the trait system is going to be a huge part of the game. Different characters and classes have different tags and these tags define how certain people will interact with you. For instance if your a criminal the local constable might not want to talk to you, however if your a soldier or noble you may get a completely different set of dialogue options. While the game is still in early access and still being actively developed I really love the potential it has and after the success of the original divinity Im pretty confident in recommending this game. That being said ATM it only has about 8 hours of storyline you may wish to wait till future content gets implemented before pulling the trigger!

1125,"I don't usually write reviews for games but this one deserves one. From the get go this game is absolutley stunning from graphics to gameplay and everything in between. The music captures each moment and truly adds to atmosphere of the game. The leveling is great and makes you feel like you earned each skill and source point. The map is huge and just keeps on giving. The story is fantastic and immersive, it takes you in to the world and makes you feel apart of it. The ending of the game truly makes you feel like what you accomplished throughout the game actually mattered, each quest and storyline had a purpose. The little easter eggs hidden in the game makes you feel like the developers are in touch with the playerbase and just add enjoyment to the game. The great thing about this is the game does not stop there, with the DM mode at your fingertips you can grab your friends and make your own story. The workshop content is great and I can't wait to try out all the mods and different stories that are coming out. The game just keeps on giving. The reason I even wrote this review is because the developers deserve every bit of credit and praise they are given, this is what gaming is supposed to look like and more developers need to take note. If you are on my friends list and reading this and are still on the edge, message me and I will continue to rant about how good this game is.

1130,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I have played Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition, It has to be one of the best games I have ever played in terms of provided content, coop, exploration and level of adaotation required in many of the opponents you encounter. Despite Early Access being limited with content release, voice overs, maps and skills, the game has still successfully impressed me, there are so many variable options that allow you to make the story fit to your playstyle, you can so choose to go about quests however you choose....i.e if you need a key to save someone, you can pickpocket the person who has said key, instead of follow through with their demands.....and similar like things, combat is fantastic, the reconstruction of the AP system is amazing and works brilliantly, the way you memorise skills for fights and have the option to use any combination of weapons you want is also a really nice touch. I personally find that the start can be very off-putting to players perhaps seeking a more casual playthrough, simply because good gear at the start is hard to find and it takes many hours to sift through enough quests and objectives and even area's just to progress to a stage where you feel ""comfortable"". The only bad point that comes to mind after playing just under 30hrs, is that combat seems to be heavily based on a need to be the same or higher level than your opponent, I have found that despite having fairly good gear, if an opponent is even 1 level infront of me, the battle is very challanging and any hits you land seem to do very little damage...where as if I return, being the same level with the same gear, I can breeze through them, I am unsure if this is just early access stuff or the way they have chosen to go about combat. Overall, I recommend both, they are extremely fun with friends and fit a varying style of game types like a mix of rpg and rts, stealth...all out, magic, melee, archery. And I enjoy that the game is not a straight line, sometimes you have to turn back and find the right gear, or adapt how you enter combat or return with skills that counter the enemies. If you made it this far....I only write reviews for games Im extremely impressed at...so for me - 10/10","August 26, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

Every aspect is of such high quality: the dialogue, the voice acting, the music, the excellent UI, the art style, the graphics, the amazing combat mechanics, the sense of exploration and adventure, the level design, the encounter design, the pacing... it's all super well done, way above what you normally get in an rpg. There's such a large amount of things to find, places to explore, animals to talk to (If you have the required talent) and let’s not forget, towns filled with victims to pickpocket! There are so many different classes you can have and you're not limited in any way, you could be a rogue necromancer or a tank archer if you wanted. I'm 60+ hours in and it has not gotten tedious or started to feel formulaic or repetitive, which is something that I've never seen happen in a long single player game either. The side stories, environments and things you do are varied enough to feel fresh after 60+ hours, the sense of exploration and adventure never goes away. Every time you level up or progress further in the story you are rewarded with new spells and abilities that keep expanding on the combat and allowing you to experiment and try new builds and tactics, which keeps you from falling into familiar combat patterns/habits and keeps you entertained.

Pros: - Split Screen for PC - Very good Graphics - Unique storytelling and situations. - Best combat in a RPG so far (Sorry for the RTWP lovers) - Pet Pal Talent - Wells - Very good customization of characters, the magic mirror is amazing. - Very well optimized, the game runs smooth with a GTX770 in ultra, only few freezes in split screen. Cons: - ORIGINS, I don't like premade characters, if you choose lone wolf you skip a very big part of the game. - No Linux support. Seriously Larian? I needed to make a partition only to play the game. - Poor localization. I'm a native spanish speaker (I'm from Spain), for me english is not an issue but it is for my girlfriend...

1143,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW An incredible game that promises to be even more amazing when it launches next week. The combat really stands head-and-shoulders above other classic RPGs like Tyranny and Pillars of Eternity. So few RPGs of any type really manage to make it feel like what skill or spell you're using really matters. In D:OS2 even weak skills and spells can find their place in combat if they can create an advantage. Even the weakest fire spell can turn the tides if the enemy is standing in oil. Let me share some fun moments with the AI. I thought I could bamboozle the enemy by giving my main character the Zombie trait. This trait allows them to heal when poisoned but take damage from healing spells/skills/potions. I foolishly assumed that they wouldn't be able to take advantage of that but if anything it made my life harder. So many AI enemies have a basic ranged healing spell/skill, some of which will restore health over several turns. They were all too happy to use them on my character. At some other point, I was flirting with a woman who was part of a band of thugs. We got along well and promised to meet up in the future. Shortly after that I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off her boss by insisting that he free my elven kin. In the ensuing battle the woman I had wooed fought against her compatriots in order to help me. She burned alive in the fray and I vowed to take her diary with me for the rest of my days. In another encounter I was well positioned to stave off the enemy with my tank. The enemy mage saw this and cast a spell on him that swapped his position with a caged demon. I had to spend precious turns bashing the cage door open to escape while my squishy mages scattered. The game is packed with these kinds of fun moments and turns and those were all within the first couple hours of play. Larian took what already worked in D:OS, improved it, and then fixed a lot of what didn't work. I have no idea how the co-op is but I imagine it will be excellent.","September 8, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
1144,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW I'll keep it simple by listing my least favorite thing (which isn't even that bad), to my favorite aspect of this game. My biggest Con: - Substantial UI Changes from Divinity: Original Sin that may take some time to get used to. It doesn't always feel like the most natural or intuitive system. My biggest Pro: + The storytelling between different characters/companions is always unique. Dialogue options make a difference in how they interact with you, and how the entire game unfolds. I also love the new classes and spells they've added since Original Sin I. This game has come a long way from when I first purchased it in Early Access. Back then it already felt like a full game and a fascinating environment that I would be happy to spend hours in, and yet the development team continues to update and polish their game. It just keeps getting better, and more fleshed out as they reach their release date. If you were a fan of Divinity: Original Sin, you'd be a fool not to give this a try for two hours to see if you like it.","September 9, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

1147,"I just finished this game with the main story completed. I've got to say that this game is one of the best for its price range, there's so much content in this game its crazy and its all voice acted :DD. Larian studio's really out did themselves with this game, if I had completed every single possible side quest/content before the main story finishes we are looking into 150hours plus (on honour mode which I play) or 100 hours plus on any other difficulty whilst reading dialogue etc.. This game is best played with friends as the character interactions/dialogue is top notch and provide really fun role playing. However I played by myself as I wanted to get immersed and finish the game on the hardest difficulty due feelings of it being rushed if I played with more people. it took me 52 hours to complete the game doing story mission only with 1 origin character story (Lohse completed) as well as critical side quests that are blocking my way to the main quest. I'm also playing on Honour Mode difficulty(if your whole party dies you save is wiped), basically I have to play very safe ( I died quarter way in the game, salty af). This game is worth every penny and its price tag just beats some of AAA games on global top sellers on steam for content/replayability to price ratio.

1148,"I played with my wife. In the first few acts, the game looked like it would save marriage. By act 3, story mechanics forced our characters into conflict, spiraling into the real world. 10/10 would divorce again.","October 25, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
1149,"The best independent game this year. Why do we even need publisher anymore? Well in reality publishers do have their uses since they have deep fat pockets, but at least Larian is showing others that you don't need a business guy looking over you shoulder to make great games. The RPG game type does not really fit all tastes I mind you, this game is best for a RPG lover or a few friends enjoying some relaxing fun time. Not really going to give you intense gun fights or stuff, it's not the right game type.","November 26, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

1155,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game. Unfortunately, this game has the same pros and cons as the first part. I was hoping the second part would be less buggy (but it was really bad, I had brocken quests, and glitches, and a lot of achievements in the multiplayer didn't appear for the guest player before the definitive edition, and so on). I was hoping that they will make enough content for the game, especially for the latest part (wroooong, tons of half-empty locations, tons of useless npc, some of them look like they might be part of the quests, but they don't). I hated the main quest in the first part, because it was lame love-triangle. In the second part we don't have that (thanx you very much!) but we have a plot twist from Baldur's gate instead (it might be worse than that, but meh). But the game mechanics is beautiful! But you can play as undead! But THE TELEPORTATION! This game has some wonderful features which you can use for the exploration, it has some interesting exploites, which you can find, if you know, where to look. For example you can win the fight with guards and npc lvl 8 when you are 4-5, if you are patient and think out of the box. I appreciate stuff like that very much. If you are into turn-based games and tactics, this game has some challenges for you. So this one is still hard to me. On the one hand I had quite an adventure. On the other hand I finished the game before the Difinitive edition, and it was pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Me and my friend played in coop and we saw it all: crashes, bugged quests, sometimes game couldn't run unless you run a certain file as admin, and so on. I really don't want to give ""not recommended"". I honestly think that in general this game is enjoyable. But I hope the developers will figure out how to make games from the first attempt, without difinitives and enhansed editions. And I also hope that the next game by Larian Studio will have enough content in any game stage.",October 18,2 people found this review helpful
1156,"EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Really wonderful continuation from the first D:OS game. Everything that was good about the first game is still here so it's not like relearning an entirely new game, and a lot of the clunkier parts about the first game like enormous skill cooldowns, being locked into 1 or 2 spell trees based on allocated points are refined and looking good. Love the sense of humour of the studio and the hard work and care they put into the game. Recommend highly for people who liked the first D:OS and for people new to the game. Don't need to have played the first D:OS to fully enjoy this one.","September 19, 2016",2 people found this review helpful
1157,"The game's start is an extremely, extreeeemely steep learning curve. you essentially start off with no armour, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons, and will be placed against enemies that could 1v1 you and win without breaking a sweat. Even Dark Souls gives you an easier time starting off than this, trust me. I recommend playing an Origin character before playing as custom, to get your first experience with a unique character, as the different characters have their own personal questlines and dialogue, which is interesting. Combat is amazing as ever, however the initiative system has changed from the first one, instead whoever simply has the highest will start (or if it's a scripted boss/enemy to go first), then it will alternate between friend/foe/friend/foe. Magic Armour and Physical Armour are interesting and basically grants you guranteed immuntie to certain status effects, like Stunned, Knocked down and bleeding unless said armour is reduced to 0. has it's drawback as it means if you dont have the perserverence attribute levelled some you'll get stunlocked in unfortunate positions by mages. Lots of gametime for the story, with even double if you don't skip all the dialogue and pay attention to side quests (which I didn't). overall 9/10 some bugs, but overall game is fantastic with a great story.","September 17, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

1159,"I consider this the game of the year 2017. The gaming industry has been lacking super high-quality AAA games that simply tried to create the best possible game in its respective genre - without trying hard to cash-grab and overly cut costs where you really shouldnt. The reception of Witcher 3 simply showed how starved consumers are for such quality-games. Divinity Original Sin 2... The game looks absolutely gorgeous. Stunning islands, stunning characters, amazing colors - a feast for the eye. The universe the developers created is interesting and overall excellent and suits the genre perfectly by adding that extra touch of insanity and therefore supporting player-choices which, quite frankly, are going to be insane more often than not. The ""R"" in RPG? Delivered. Replayability - The game often delivers a lot of significant choices how you can influence the world around you and a ton of ways to solve (or terribly mess up) the things you encounter. Innovation - Modding-support needs to be counted for this one. You can create adventures, mod the base game and even have a complete game-master mode. Features like crafting are an interesting touch for such a game, but can be entirely ignored if youre not into that. Spoiler, if you havent watched the trailer yet: The ground-effect based combat is also a nice touch with several connections to that. The game is fully voiced and even has a narrator. If you really listen closely you can hear that not every voice actor was perfect, but come on, the game is fully voiced and I'm really nitpicky here. Can't hire the best voice actors for a thousand characters and have all of them perform on the same level. I've got to criticise though that the multiplayer does not have a multiplayer-dialogue function. What I mean by that is that the first player who clicks on the NPC gets to do all the talking without the input of the others. Sure, you can punch each other in Teamspeak and start complaining about choices, but that's no fun. There's a PvP function in the game, but I dont really feel like that's the thing I'd like end up with when I start up a >Coop< session. . TL;DR The game offers serious bang for the buck and I'd struggle if you asked me for more recent games of such high quality.",July 26,2 people found this review helpful

1163,"Like most people here, Ive played early access build when it first released. Now , one year later Im playing the full release version. Not only have the developers kept in close contact with the player base over the course of time, but have delivered a solid, triple aaa rpg experience that will be remembered for years to come. This not only surpasses all DOS games but deserves a place among the best cRPGs, if not, RPGS as a whole. There is SOOOO much to do. The only thing that the game suffers from is so much quests at once. Personally, I do not like having 5 active quests to start off with when stepping into a world I know very little of. If you are a streamer, I advize not to even look at the log and do whatever you want, which in most cases, you can! Dont like that NPC? You can kill him . Dont like the guards guarding the castle? Kill em! A lot of what you do has a consequence though! That, too me is what makes a grand rpg experience. Graphics are solid, music memorable and the sound effects grand. Characters are likeable and even the voice overs are the best heard in a rpg ive heard in a long time!!! (Since Dragon Age Origins). There is a slight learning curve so give some patience at first knowing the quests and just go out there and make some npc friends . :P Two thumbs up Larian!","September 14, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

1180,"Just wanted to give a quick thumbs up for this game because it absolutely deserves the positive praise it's been getting. I've been having a blast playing with my partner in crime. It's perfect for co-op if you're looking to adventure into an interesting world with 3 other friends or just your favorite person, I highly recommend it. You really have to communicate with your team or partner about what roles each other will be playing if you want to succeed in this game. For example, I'm the persuasive barterer and lockpicker, with an archer and knight. My boyfriend is the item finder and crafter, who plays a healer/summoner/buffer and a battlemage. Our team works pretty perfectly together. Defeating enemies after a long battle with no one dying because the both of us expertly communicated with one another over who to hit and what moves to make, etc, is extremely satisfying. I even feel much closer to him because of how well we work together, the game is quite the bonding experience. It's also fun laughing at some of the many absurd interactions in the game, like being licked by a dog whose been eating corpses and ending up getting deseased because of that, all because you told the dog it was a good boy. Long story short, I recommend this game as both a great solo experience, and an incredible muiltiplayer experience. Update: The game is still fantastic.","October 1, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
1181,"Product received for free EARLY ACCESS REVIEW Divinity original sin 2 is the highly anticipated sequel to Divinity original sin. Divinity 2 is currently in early access with the 1st chapter in the campaign available for play. This first chapter has 8 - 12 hours of gameplay currently with more to come. You have the option to either create your own character or use a character with an origin created for you. The character creation and class system is awesome. So many options are available to you that initially it was a struggle for me to pick one. I havent planned out this many playthroughs in a game personally before even starting since skyrim. I was personally torn between an assassin styled character or a wizzard. Ended up going with wizzard cause I get to blow stuff up! Divinity 2 has a very beautifully crafted world with a rather deep storyline. It will require you taking the time to read it and some of the character interactions are still a little fuzzy due to it being early access but you can already see how the trait system is going to be a huge part of the game. Different characters and classes have different tags and these tags define how certain people will interact with you. For instance if your a criminal the local constable might not want to talk to you, however if your a soldier or noble you may get a completely different set of dialogue options. While the game is still in early access and still being actively developed I really love the potential it has and after the success of the original divinity Im pretty confident in recommending this game. That being said ATM it only has about 8 hours of storyline you may wish to wait till future content gets implemented before pulling the trigger!

1182,"I don't usually write reviews for games but this one deserves one. From the get go this game is absolutley stunning from graphics to gameplay and everything in between. The music captures each moment and truly adds to atmosphere of the game. The leveling is great and makes you feel like you earned each skill and source point. The map is huge and just keeps on giving. The story is fantastic and immersive, it takes you in to the world and makes you feel apart of it. The ending of the game truly makes you feel like what you accomplished throughout the game actually mattered, each quest and storyline had a purpose. The little easter eggs hidden in the game makes you feel like the developers are in touch with the playerbase and just add enjoyment to the game. The great thing about this is the game does not stop there, with the DM mode at your fingertips you can grab your friends and make your own story. The workshop content is great and I can't wait to try out all the mods and different stories that are coming out. The game just keeps on giving. The reason I even wrote this review is because the developers deserve every bit of credit and praise they are given, this is what gaming is supposed to look like and more developers need to take note. If you are on my friends list and reading this and are still on the edge, message me and I will continue to rant about how good this game is. To everyone else, if you enjoy these types of RPGs, its a no brainer.

I will eventually update the review once the full game comes out. I just can't wait to spend hours on this, and I am also very excited for the Game Master mode. Edit: The voice acting is god damn good. I can't imagine playing this without the VA now. The combat is very interesting and very rewarding. You have to play smart and position yourself well. The fights are very difficult at the very beginning but as time goes on the game gets easier as you start to know how what you are doing. Utilising every members of the party and creating big combos never felt more satisfying. The story so far is great. The pacing is good and the story itself is quite dark. Helps when you have interesting party members (who are also quite insane). I haven't even gotten my hand on Game Master mode yet (my main reason for buying this game) or the Arena. There are just so much you can do in this game. If you are a fan of RPG game, this game is a must buy.","September 14, 2017",2 people found this review helpful

I have found myself stopped playing 2 times and just listening the soundtrack cause i think it might change if i enter other area. This has not happen to me since Final Fantasy 10. -NPCs are really well written and voice acted. I was amazed by Fane, The Red Prince and the Assasin dude in the beginning. Thats my 3 people party btw. -Turn based combat is really good. It is also challenging even on the lowest level on difficulty. -Game looks amazing with max graphic settings. The water makes me wanna jump in there and swim. -Quests and their completion is done really well. Not one quest feels like a chore and there is actually no direct markings on the map on where to go. It might show you a location of a NPC or location but the rest you have to figure out by yourself. Really nice oldschool vibe init. -I have only been out of the tutorial island and it took me 17 hours. I cant imgaine how much content there is for the rest of the game. Cons: -Battle might be frustrating in the beginning if you are not familiar with the skills. It took me several attemps on several quests on the normal mode until my party was not demolished by the mobs. This is not really a bad thing cause we need more games that makes us learn the gameplay and try our best but i understand it might frustrate some poeple. -Camera. Camera is pain if you try to change the view all the time but you have to do it in order to loot everything. It takes some time to get used to. Overall this game is really amazing. It gives me this deep athmospere like when i furst used to play Arcanum or Icewind dale. Totally recommended.","October 21, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
1196,"One of the most flexible, polished, detailed, and generally enjoyable games I've ever played. If you like RPGs, you should play this game. Easy to pick up, gameplay can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be. Every character and NPC is voice-acted with individual dialogue, even down to the animals wandering around town - I've never encountered two NPCs who said the same thing. This may not sound huge, but it's a subtle effort that makes the entire experience far more immersive than I've seen in a game. For instance, talking to every random person in a town never feels boring or a chore. It's one of many seemingly minor decision by the creators that elevates the polish and feel of the game above other RPGs, and exemplifies the attention to detail put into every aspect of the game. The mechanics are great, the graphics are great, controls are great, crafting is good (haven't played with it too much yet), music, writing and voice-acting are absolutely top-notch, skill/magic trees are flexible and mean you can essentially turn anyone in your party into whatever you want. Build archers who also summon and buff creatures to fight for you, two-handed-axe-wielding close-combat necromancers, seriously whatever you want. I love this game - I'm not even halfway through it, but I already want to start another party just to try out new party builds. Just get it, unless you're on a serious budget, and even then, it's probably worth skimping on groceries or something this month.","October 23, 2017",2 people found this review helpful
