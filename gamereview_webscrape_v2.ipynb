      "Upfront, I'll say this game does have some fun gameplay at times. However a litany of problems make me give this a negative review.\n",
      "- Dumbfoundingly inconsisent difficulty. Battles range from entertainingly fun to stupendously, insultingly difficult. Seriously, you should never have to go into a battle knowing EXACTLY what is going to happen in order to have a chance of surviving (not winning, just surviving). And the only reason you know what's about to happen is because you've tried it half a dozen times and failed each time.\n",
      "- Weak story compared to D:OS, and heavy use of sad, tired and predictable tropes. Half the time it wasn't even clear what we were trying to accomplish, and who/what we were fighting against or for. And when major plot points did occur, most of the time our response was \"Really? We're doing this again? Sigh...\"\n",
      "- For a game that encourages you to forge your own way, it punishes you for not following some pre-assumed path through the world. Heaven help you if you choose a different direction - enemies do not scale with level, and gear that would help you manage is prohibitively expensive. So if you head west when the game expects you to head east, you'll struggle.\n",
      "- Battles that break the game's own pre-established rules. Examples: repeat casting of abilities which have multi-round cooldowns, and stacking identical status ailments. Case in point: The Sallow Man's Airborne Plague, which bypasses all armour (physical and magical), stacks with itself (I was at -15 Con at one point because of three repeat casts) and can be cast EVERY ROUND.\n",
      "- Inconsistent lore/world impacts: you can kill someone and consume their soul, only for them to show up again later, apparently none the worse for wear. (Yay, that achieved a lot...).\n",
      "- Multiplayer feels like two single player games occurring simultanously, with some quests not progressing or closing because the wrong player spoke to the quest giver. To add to that, if the speaker doesn't have the required item for a fetch quest, too bad - having it in the party isn't enough (but the game doesn't let you know that, does it? That would be too much to ask...)\n",
      "- Quest system is broken. Somewhat repaired with a patch, but if you'd progressed past a certain point, the damage was done. The Tarquin side-quest was just a balls-up.\n",
      "- My partner, who was using a controller (I use keyboard/mouse), had endless difficulty with target selection and interactions with the environment. Certain skills just wouldn't work (no reason was given - you just can't select this character because we say so). The controller interface also made line-of-sight hard to gauge, so several times critical actions were lost because of some unseen obstacle.\n",
      "- Multi-stage boss battles: stop, just stop with this tired, over-used and just irritating chiche. This has been done so many times it's just not interesting, exciting or surprising.\n",
      "- Some puzzles have an exact solution required, but the game gives you absolutely no guidance or hints. Another case in point: the Cursed Revenants in the Lizard Embassy. We gave up trying to solve that and just left them there. We got around them enough to finish the quest, but they'll be sitting there in the ruins till Judement Day.\n",
      "\n",
      "More on the battle difficulty: if you're at the correct character level for a given encounter (ie a L5 party against L5 opponents) I don't think it's unreasonable that your party members are able to survive the opening salvo. I GM a Pathfinder group and so understand that some encounters are meant to be more challenging that others, depending on their importance in the plot progression. However, given that in 95% of encounters one or more of the opponents invariably go first, the number of times one (or more) of our party members were one-shot killed or disabled before they've had a chance to act is kinda ludicrous. This ties back into my previous point where you have to know exactly what is about to happen in order to have a chance of getting through the battle (which I consider meta-gaming in a cRPG). Sure, give the enemies superior starting positions and outnumber the party, but don't compount that by making every mook immediately superior to the whole party.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a game that we've spent over 100 hours on, this has left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I can't say I've enjoyed it. We've given up trying to win the final battle, and to be honest I couldn't care less about how it ends. There were occasional moments of fun, but the negatives outweigh them.\n",

      "content: I have never been more ambivalent about a game before in my life. I have never played a game with such amazing concepts and potential, squandered by fundamental failings of game design. The fine first, second, and third acts, while plagued with the issues I am going to discuss, are not nearly as horrible as the absolutely baffling experience of act 4. All issues previously felt in the game are so excacerbated in act 4, that I thought I was playing an entirely different game. 1. The armor system incentivizes perversely unfun tactics. With the recent changes of taunt, they have thankfully recognized this. Nonetheless, it causes both the players and the AI to initially launch into DEFCON 1 tier nuclear exchange, with the victor emerging as the one to freeze, knockdown, or terrify (fittingly, the most terrifying effect constantly abused by the AI) their opponent. When the encounters start becoming quite difficult, this exchange can pretty much decide the outcome of the battle in 2 turns. 2. The AI in this game is awful. They are completely incapable of working to together and effectively chaining combos. So, in compensation, the developers have simply cheated ridiculous stats onto the AI, often allowing them 6 AP regen per turn, insane armor values, and a divinity level capability of using source. At one instance, a random AI sourcerer had an initiative of 50... why? It inexplicably had a base initiative of +20... If you encounter an enemy called 'nemisis,' evacuate to your nearest fallout shelter because they deserve the title of godwoken over all else. 3. Rapid descent into over-designed gimmick encounters, often with no communication of what to do. Act 4 is especially egregious about this. I have no idea why they decided endlessly respawning enemies, ambushes, and gimmick bosses were good ways of designing a game, but it is not. It shows complete insecurity in their combat system that they needed to replace every regular fight with some poor attempt at twisting the formula. Ultimately, it either ends with the player figuring out the gimmick and beating the encounter easily, or a frustrating cycle of save cheesing until the correct tactic is found. Its like... the previous 3 courses of this game's meal was just a delicious italian dinner, and instead of desert being a logical extension of what came before it, its dog diarrhea plated to look like chocolate mousse... yeah... its unique, but its ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just like every late game fight in this game. Unfortunately, the game's stellar writing was unable to save the experience for me. I honestly recommend turning on explorer mode if you do decide that is what you want to get out of this game.\n",
