Zastier,678,"2,003",32,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,33.4,"Let's see: -Game releases in Early Access with a lot of promise -As it does Larian constantly outdo them selves with updates -They vastly increase the complexity of the AI -Improve the progression in several ways -Give us two well developed and deep extra skill trees -Create a truly grand undead race with interesting mechanics -AGAINST ALL ODD include full voice acting for a game with the amount of dialogue -And include a fully orchestral soundtrack  And the reviews for this masterpiece of a game are going down because some Russians got salty over the translations being delayed a bit. This game lost it's Overwhelmingly Positive rating simply because they didn't manage to translate all of the 80,000 or so lines of dialogue in time for the release. Seriously.  EDIT: To everyone asking, the game is FULLY voice acted, every NPC, no matter how insignificant has a voice. That is somewhere in the area of 80,000 voices lines, where a lot had to be recorded 8 times for each one of the player voices."
Rojigami,214,690,17,"October 25, 2017",Recommended,237.1,"This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!  Great work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!"
Lost Sinner,79,518,12,"August 15, 2017",Recommended,"2,780.1","‚ô¶ One of the best cRPG out there, if you are a fan of roleplaying games, this is definitely a must buy. For those who never play thier first game, no worries, although they take places in a same universe, each has a standalone story. This one starts thousand years after the first one so you are not missing anything.  ‚ô¶ One of best thing about DOS 2 is it gameplay. It's turn-based, slow-paced but really interactive with many different elemental combinations, cool interactions between each abilities and your surrounding environmental even statuses are interesting.   For some examples you can create some nasty chain explosive reactions with a combo of Fire and Poison, any kind of liquid (water/blood/poison/...) left on the battleground can reacted to Air turning it into a pool of Electricity deal damage and stun anyone in it.    Buffs/debuffs status usually do more than one thing and may interact with eachother, Stone Armor not only increase your physical armor but also stop you from bleeding/burning because you are solid rock. Peace Of Mind is the kind of ability that let you see a bigger pictures, it provides stats buff and cure Blindness BUT also remove frenzy status Rage, because the target have become more wise so no more bold actions. Rage on the otherhand is also another status which increase damage output but at a great cost of defense down.   Surrounding environmental also plays a great part in your game, say if someone go invisible and there is happen to be raining, that sneaky guy will be revealed because he's wet. And because water react violently with electricity, he will be taking increased Air damage but will take less damage if you throw a fireball at him. Walking through frozen ground and you may trip and get knocked down. Standing on high ground will make your spells/abilities/items reach further with increased damage. ‚ô¶ Talents in game open up your playstyles depend on what you pick. Lone Wolf or One Man Army does what it says for who want to go solo, Leech turn you into a vampire allowing you to heal when standing near blood or Zombie make Poison heal you instead but normal healing will damage you. Because the game is classless , you can be anyone , mix and match anything you like, you may be born a warrior but dream to be a mage, go learn some magic and become a battlemage. Who says warrior can't be sneaky, go ahead and get yourself some rogue abilities...  ‚ô¶ Divinity Original Sin 2 also offer you really great roleplaying experience, it has a great balance between combat and talking with rich dialogues and occasional silly humors. You can play as different races: Human , Elf , Dwarf , Undead and Lizard..yeah thats' right, you can become a Lizard that spits out Fire. Each races have different racial skill and special power, NPCs may also react/talk differently to you depend on your race. There are also different original characters ingame who have thier own story, goals and personalites for you to play, but if you want to create your own character, the game also offer many different origins which called tags: Soldier, Scholar, Outlaw,..etc which plays a part in dialogue. The Origins will remain in your game as companion and you can have different perspective on them through dialogues/questline which is really cool imo,  there is also a relationship system ingame (not fully included in EA , will be in full game) which can create intense rivalry, friendship, enmity and romance!  ‚ô¶ Visually, the game looks great, it's colorful most of the times and can be dark when needed to be, infact the DOS 2 is meant to be darker and much more focused than the previous one. Having finished Act 1 in EA, there are no fetch quests and unrelated to the storyline, all of them is connected one way or another, each tell you a story about the game's world and ultimately leading to a bigger picture. You can finish quests in different ways , any path is a progression, you'll never feel getting stuck, there are always different paths to take, things to do. Oh a maze, i'm not in the mood to solve puzzle atm, let's jump/fly through it, dont have wings? Look around, there's maybe some other hidden paths/shortcut or go do some questline maybe some of them will shed some lights of the Maze making it easier to go through.  ‚ô¶ Crafting is in game (duh..! obviously, it's an cprg game) and it's RICH. Just look up the crafting list in DOS 1, and  before there were just a combination of two items, in DOS 2 you can have a combination of total 5 items. Here comes the great part, you can craft new skills by combining books of different schools. You can turn a normal rain into a mean blood storm. Mixing a Pryo spell with Necromancy, you can make corpses explode dealing massive damage to nearby targets as if you cutting thier buddies down wasn't enough..  ‚ô¶ There are alot more cool features ingame but i won't include them all in this small review. So i'll add one more thing that may get some people excited: There will be a Game Master Mode! which have up to 5 players in total which include 4 main players and 1 GM. Allowing you to create your own worlds and adventure with friends, the devs also offer alot of tools for easier time making your own dungeon, you can control anything, the stats, the weather, music, dialouges, events,..etc and you can even do it on the fly! You can take a quick look of the mode here (a GM Mode game hosted by Matt Mercer)  ‚ô¶ If you are interested in some gameplays, feel free to check my videos: Honour Mode Walkthrough "
Wren,380,272,9,January 4,Recommended,100.6,"Mind = Blown Divinity: Original Sin 2 is easily my top game of 2017, and probably up there in my list of most favorite games of all time. My mind was completely blown every step of the way through this fantastic journey, start to finish.   Positives+ You do ùòØùò∞ùòµ need to play its predecessor to understand what's going on in this title. + That voice acting. Every line. Every banter. Even the narration when nothing needs to be said between characters. It's fantastic. + A beautifully detailed, living world. You can see how much love and work when into this. So much to explore, so much to see. So many little secrets tucked away here and there. Not to mention while in combat, every single turn needs to be thought out depending on the enviroment around you.  + The assortment of items, weapons and armor is definitely not lacking.  + The ability to freely make your own ""class"" for yourself and your companions. Mix and match whatever skills you want. Whatever suits your playstyle. If you want a Skeleton guy to be your main healer with Necromancy, then do it! + I finished the game on the easiest difficulty in about 85-90 hours, give or take. And that's without finishing all the side quests or companion quests. The amount of content stuffed into this game will leave you plenty to do. + Co-op. Yes. You can play the entire game start to finish with a friend, with a few friends, with strangers. It doesn't matter.  + Dungeon Master mode. Does creating entire campaigns like Dungeons and Dragons appeal to you? Then heck yes! I never really took much time to dabble in it, but I can see the appeal to it. + Replayability. This is huge for me. So many choices that will leave you wondering ""what if I had done this differently?""   Negatives- It's been a fair bit since I played, but I had an issue finishing a companion quest that was tied into the same NPC as another companion I had. Once completed, one companion was stuck and could not progress. I ended up finishing the game without completing it. - A few bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking. Most notably in ""The Arx"". There was one house with locked doors in which you could run right through them. - I noticed here and there a fair bit of an FPS drop in combat when my screen is exploding with spell effects.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is unforgiving, doesn't coddle and definitely doesn't hold your hand, but taking the time to learn the combat system and all the little bits and pieces is worth every penny from your wallet and every second of your time."
ProfessorButts,111,489,9,"June 5, 2017",Recommended,165.6,"You will love this game if... - You like games that don't hold your hand - You like games that allow you freedom to customise your characters and experiences - You like games that TRULY reward exploration and investigation *Legit, if you don't sit there scrolling over the map looking for hidden chests, ladders, ledges, etc, you're doing it wrong* - You like high strategy, turn based combat that rewards forward thinking and planning - You like finding, using, selling or collecting loot - You have 1 or more friends that will play with you. This game shines in multiplayer  The handful of little annoying bugs and glitches are completely and utterly outweighed by how captivating and enthralling this game is... And it's still in Early Access... I see a lot of complaints that the story isn't long enough, or really focusing on the bugs, lets get real.  Bugs: - Sometimes your helmet will blink and flicker a bit - Sometimes your characters won't be within range, or have line of sight on a target they clearly should - Accuracy percentage seems to be a bit off, 80% chance to hit is more like 30%; anything under 90% is trouble That's... About it...  Story is too short? Well then play the rest of the game kid. You can speed run the ""story"" in like 20 minutes if you wanted, the real fun comes from exploring the world and finding everything else there is to do. I honestly can't believe how good this game is for an EA release and I can't wait for the full release come September. Could not recommend highly enough.  Things I would like to see in future: - More races. - More in depth customisation options for spells and abilities. Think Champions Online or the Oblivion Spell-Creation. (asking for a lot, I know) - A little control over what armour looks like on your character.  - More spells, more synergy between spells. This is already great, but why stop at great! The more points I list, the more I realise I'm just asking for more of the game. Give me more of the game mate."
Purrmaid,650,401,5,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,149.3,"It seems I've never written a review for D:OS2, and with the Steam Awards wanting us to update a review, I might as well!  Let me start by stating that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is my all time favorite game. I adored the first one. I'm worshippping the second.  This isn't a game that'll hold your hand, this isn't a game that's easy and laid back. This is the game that throws you in the middle of a world and tells you to figure it out.   It has multiple difficulty settings, so if tactical turnbased combat isn't your strongest suit there ARE easier modes for you! But the harsh combat isn't the only thing that makes this game hard. It's the quests, the world, there is NO handholding. You got to figure out what to do, you got to figure out which quest to solve and focus on. And boy are there many quests to focus on!  Some seem absolutely random, some seem like just a typical sidequest kind of job that ends up being the key ingredient in solving the big mystery! I love that, I love that the first act has you stuck on an island, a jail, and your job is to break out. And how would one do this? There isn't just one way, or two, or three. There are more than that. Way more. And it's up to you to figure out the way.   There are five races, human, dwarf, elf, lizard, and undead. Each brings with their own talents and experience in the game. You might have trouble with certain quests because they hate your race, you might need to find another way into a town because they don't like dwarves. It's extremely immersive, and playing it as a coop makes it even so.   I'm not sure I have words to describe to you how amazing this game is. I like difficult games, I played this on Tactical, which is hard, and on some boss fights me and my coop partner would sit here for two hours. Reloading. Repositioning. Changing skills. Reloading. over and over untill we finally managed to beat said boss. It was one of the most amazing experiences I've had in gaming all year. Just that little bit of having to figure out how something works.  There are Character Tags and Talents that you can choose that really makes this into an immersive rpg. Pet Pal allows you to talk to animals. That sad dog over there, cheer him up and he'll help you. That nasty fire elemental? Guess what! She needs your help! You can have a talent that makes you stink, and people dislike you because of it.   Larian Studios is a dev team to follow. I cannot wait to see what comes next. (Voice acting wasn't in the original budget. There was partial voice acting, but somehow they managed to make the entire game voice acted, without starting another kickstarter and without pushing the game back a few months. It was a surprise untill launch and I give them major props for doing this)"
PixelGrotto,150,144,39,March 2,Recommended,136.9,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is like playing a very enthusiastic Dungeon Master's homebrew campaign. Said DM really fell in love with the cosmology and deities section of the Dungeon Master's Guide as well as the idea of creating an epic, REALLY LONG arc where his players eventually achieve godhood. Mr. DM also put an awful lot of time into fleshing out his world and making sure you know that HIS elves are DIFFERENT (they EAT people and get their MEMORIES, see), though for some reason he decided to keep his dwarves Scottish.  This DM is not perfect and has his faults. For one, he really loves throwing environmental effects all over the battlefield to the point of it becoming annoying. Fire spreads 50 feet in an arc! Now ice shoots out over the fire! Now smoke and lighting and tentacles spread atop the fire and ice! Yeah! Near the end of the campaign, his planning starts to slip, both in combat design and in lore. For instance, he offers his players a variety of different endings to their grand adventure, but none of them are all that great, and one gets the feeling that he randomly chose the final boss by just flipping through the Monster Manual with the intent of picking a Challenge Rating 30 beastie just to tell his other DM friends that ""I PUT MY PLAYERS UP AGAINST THIS GUY ONCE AND THEY KIND OF SURVIVED!""   After playing for nearly 140 hours, though, none of his players can say it wasn't an epic time at the table. They'll probably be back for more.  BTW, Mr. DM - Lohse was the best character you created."
Genky,186,175,0,"February 5, 2017",Recommended,131.4,"What can I say ... This is Belgium's jewel in the gaming industry. The kind of game developer we need more of.  More content, more polished and more fun than any triple A game developer will give you, at 2/3 the price and no hundreds of holes to add paid content later. Even in the Early Access phase this is already more polished than most games are 3 months after official launch.  The game itself: It's the original + improved and better in every single way. Graphics look great and the engine is very well optimized (already). The combat and progression system is very well done and fun. Multiplayer even better integrated than the original. Storyline and characters are interesting and well written. The music, I absolutely love it. Affordable.  Even if you fear the Early Access tag, just buy this if you're into this type of games at all, you won't be disappointed and you'll actually be supporting a developer that delivers and makes games for the gamers, not for mass revenue. (Of course they're a business in it for profit too, but there's a difference between 45 euro for a full game and 60 euro for a game with 10 strategically placed holes for paid DLC, pushed into release with game breaking bugs. Larian Studios actually ditched their publisher and switched to crowd funding because they forced them to make and launch the game the way they didn't want it, that should tell you enough.)  Larian Studios, as a Belgian, I can say you make us proud. Please keep doing what you're doing, never succumb to the attitude most major developers and publishers have, it'd be a huge loss in the game industry."
VAC in time by Hubert Lewis,229,395,24,January 22,Recommended,49.9,Blah blah blah best RPG literally of the past 10 years blah blah blah.  Here's What Matters. You can literally do anything and the game is prepared for all of it. Pay Full Price. Games like this don't happen enough.
Surplus Cyborg,103,"1,001","1,542","November 16, 2017",Recommended,91.6,Talked to a chicken that claimed he was a mighty wizard. Called him a liar. The chicken teleported me to the other side of the continent. Had to walk back to the rest of my party. Serves me right for doubting the mighty magic chicken. This game is awsome.
Zorao,340,242,5,"November 4, 2017",Recommended,80.6,"This game is a masterpiece. Easily one of the best games I ever played in my life.   The gear is very rewarding, you notice your characters actually develop and become way stronger with each level and each new gear equipment.   The story is rich and the voice acting makes it really helpful if you don't like reading dialogues. You can play the game multiple times and you would have a different experience each time you play it.   Try to get some friends to play with you, they can either help you or turn against you. For example your friend could tell the guards that you stole something and they will put you in jail!. or you can make your friend distract traders and you pickpocket them.   I really recommend this game."
Zahbuhdoo,459,269,2,"September 20, 2017",Recommended,178.7,"If you like turn-based RPG's with lots of customization and a good story to put along with them, do yourself a favor and buy this game. This game will leave you wanting more every time you put it down. Choices matter. Characters are interesting. Combat is fluid. This is one of the better, if not best, Turn-Based RPG's out there.   Side Note: Larian Studios has shown how much they care about the content they put out by giving you the best they can offer. Did you notice the price tag isn't $60? Did you notice the Divine Edition is only $15 but not at all game-changing or content locking from the base game? Did you notice the Game Master Mode wasn't a purchasable DLC? That is humility right there. They aren't trying to squeeze every last person for some money. They are looking to create quality content so that we can enjoy it at, for what you're buying, an extremely generous price. They knew the fan-base and what people wanted and how bad they wanted it. They still did not take advantage of us. Larian Studios has earned my undying support."
Dracknov,154,518,7,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,271.9,"I was tired of games that only tests your reaction skill. I was tired of games that say it's 60 dollars, only to have randomized loot boxes or micro-transaction implemented later in time. I was tired of games that were advertised to be wide as an ocean but ended up being shallow like a puddle.   Then Divinity Original Sin 2 came out. Each encounter is well executed and designed flawlessly. Enemy design  is varied and leaves my friend and I saying ""WTF is that!?"" often. Every time my friend finds some epic loot, we cannot wait to identify it to see who can make use of the item. Quests are a joy to do and often leads you to find more quests that's filled with important decision making. Every choice you make has an impact on the world and I have been sent to jail multiple times for making the wrong decision. For $44.99 you are not buying a game but an experience. An experience to truly go on an epic adventure. Fights are never easy but once you learn the satisfaction of besting the enemy combatant that you failed to take down multiple times, you are left leaving for more glory. (Currently playing on Tactician Mode)   I am not sure if anyone is going to read this review since this is my very first review with a positive rating (My other review is for Fallout 4 CREATION CLUB so you already know what rating I gave) but if you are looking for a game with challenge, depth, and quality give this game a try. I have been playing this game for over 102 hours and I have a feeling that this is only the beginning."

I don't go a single moment in this game without being mesmerized by how fantastic it is.  I'll list some pros:  -Beautiful art style, everything looks amazing.  -Combat that is both simple and incredibly difficult at the same time. After two-to-three encounters the player will have a good grasp of how combat works, but throughout the entire game they'll be learning new ways to manipulate the environment and their abilities to play better.  -Fantastic writing, honestly amazing.  -Perfect soundtrack, every sound and song in this game is so perfectly adjusted for the situation it's seamless and very immersive.  -Highly addictive, once I sit down to play I'm practically rooted to my chair to continue.  -Companions you'll care about, it's the tragedy of lesser RPGs that your companions are boring and lifeless, but here, everyone has their own ambitions and goals, and WILL pursue them.    There's very little wrong about this game. Previously I mentioned that voice acting won't be included which would be a con to some, but in a complete surprise Larian have voiced the entire game, despite the fact that was never planned throughout development.  Highly recommend purchasing it, you really can't go wrong on this purchase."
üëåm8,102,179,25,February 15,Recommended,231.8,"Most Animals in Modern RPGs:  ‚ñ´ [Player]: *clicks cat* ‚ñ´ [Cat]: *meow sound* ‚ñ´ *end dialogue* Divinity: Original Sin 2:  ‚ñ´ [Player with Pet Pal skill]: *clicks cat* ‚ñ´ [Narrator]: As you approach a stray cat, it looks up to you with its pupils thin as a needle... ‚ñ´ [Cat]: 'TIS A TERRIBLE DAY, INNIT? ‚ñ´ *shows dialogue options* Divinity: Original Sin 2 has reached new heights of what it is to be expected on huge Indie Games. Made by Larian Studios, it was able to level with AAA games that it even surpasses the standards, regardless of its flaws.  You'll play as your own character in the story, and embark on a journey towards the world of Rivellon as you find the answer to the cause of the Void's awakening. You could also play as one of the six main characters with their own unique story if character creation is not your thing.  Also, quicksaving before doing anything else is a must. Talk to someone, quicksave first. Interacting an item, quicksave first. Opening a door, quicksave. After an autosave, quicksave.  REVIEW The game is very similar to its previous title, Divinity: Original Sin (DOS1). There may be changes, but there's nothing too drastic as far as I've observed.   STORYDOS2 moved towards a more interesting Plot. While it still does have DOS1's lighthearted ""HaHa""s, the studio was able to put the humor at the right spot. In a way, they're able to make a decently captivating tale for an RPG. What's so interesting about the plot's flow is that the game doesn't make you feel like you need to save the world because when you want to go somewhere, doing so will progress your main story. The linearity is barely present that I didn't even know which quest I should keep my focus on my first playthrough.   It's quite unfortunate, for me at least, how the game treats the Party Interaction on the whole story as it progresses because it had less... interaction. Back in DOS1's party interaction, you're able to choose a dialogue for everyone. DOS2 removed that feature and only allows you to choose a dialogue for your main character only; however, in turn they added an Attitude system, so your party members and everyone else in the game have their own morals and beliefs. In the end, it sadly lowers the replayability. GAMEPLAYOn the matter of the game's Quest System, I become lost throughout my first playthrough. Given that most of your progress relates to the main story, a quest that I've ignored for an in-game day (since I'm focusing on a particular quest at that time) suddenly updates along with the quest I'm currently taking. There are some cases during an update to my current quest, a new quest opens up in my journal. In a long run, the quest log became flooded to a point that I don't know which quest would I continue.  The turn-based Combat System is really great. Given how there's hundreds of skills and hardly countable ways of killing an enemy, the fact that good positioning actually gives an advantage, it's hard to get bored of it. Unlike many turn-based games, the Original Sin series shines on how your surroundings affect you and your enemy's strategy. The lit torch stand, the oil puddle poured near an explosive barrel, the sea shore, everything is interactive. In DOS2, the height advantage was a great addition.  The game's Challenge is the one that sparks its replayability. It's not just how unfair some items/skills are, it's the moment when the AI actually knows how, where, and when to use the environment and situation to their advantage. Once you've come up with a different build, their playstyle changes. They are annoyingly smart that sometimes they're three turns ahead of you if you're not aware enough.  Carelessly set a trap mine near an enemy, one of them will then teleport you on top of it. Enemies even face behind a wall just so your Rogue character can't backstab him/her. Although, there is a time when a hazardous area is too wide, the AI keeps on walking around the said area until they die instead of just standing still. It has its awful moments sadly. AESTHETICSComparing the two of the series, DOS2 was able to utilize more graphical features which made it far more detailed than DOS1. It shifted from a cartoony colorful vibe into a more realistic and bleak environment. Even so, the Graphics were decent at best.   The Music score is an improvement from the previous title. Just comparing the two themes, you could say that they have more budget this time haha. It's interesting how you could select your character's instrument theme, so you could hear a particular instrument on certain occasions depending on what you chose for one of your characters. As much as how catchiness goes however, it's not as grand as what I always hear from Bioware and Bethesda games. For short, DOS2's music is ingenuinely good.  Sample OST I personally liked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxuC0i5S_LE For a game that lacks flashy CGI cinematics, they were able to compensate it with the expressive Voice Dialogues. You've gotta hand it to the voice actors and scriptwriters for making their characters and npcs feel alive. It's interesting how most of them have something to say inside and outside of the conversation. FEATURESFor a turn-based game, the Playability is good. Besides the 4 player multiplayer, there's couch co-op and controller support. The game is playable in any way but 3-4 splitscreen multiplayer, yet it's still rare to find such accessibility this time around in video games.  Game Master Mode is a cool feature that you can't believe it's included on the standard game. Though, I'm not fond of Dungeons and Dragons, it really seems that's what it's trying to make out of this game mode. In my case, this is a casual DnD that includes the game's character abilities and such. An interesting mode to say the least.  Arena Mode is a decent feature if you're up for some PvP duels. Besides the fact that you could play online, there's an offline mode called Hot Seat where you and your fellow players play in one device.  Lastly, this game has the Classic Edition (CE) which removes tons of new dialogues and enemy encounters along with the updated User Interface for controller users from the Definitive Edition.

Divinity 2 rarely presents you with black and white moral choices, and a simple slip of the tongue will see you losing loved ones fast.  The combat is challenging, in a good way. It allows you to customize your party completely and make logical and creative decisions in combat that you don't really expect to work but then they totally have an effect you weren't expecting....  ...that is why this game is perfection. Every time I pushed at the borders of the game to see if I could get away with something, I realised the border wasn't there... so I pushed harder and got more creative...  I have a man who can speak to Animals and I highly suggest you take the Perk that allows this ASAP in game because it opens up a huge depth to storyline. I now treat Chickens and Squirrels with the same respect as I do any other NPC. I speak to the ghosts of the dead and they present me with A LOT of moral decisions.   How far will you spin your moral compass to become Godly powerful? Who will you grow close to only to realise that at any moment they might stab you in the back or even worse... that you will have to choose to lose for the sake of the greater good?  14/10 would sneak a peek at Lizard Royalty having sex in a caravan again x"
Bee,130,104,9,June 24,Recommended,436.2,"After hitting over 400 hours in Divinity: Original Sin 2, I feel like I can finally review it in full depth.  The game is spectacular. It was everything I wanted from Original Sin and then more.   The quests are in-depth, and you feel the consequences of your character/race choices on top of the dialogue you pick. I've played four full playthroughs, and each one I was still finding things I had missed (and I'm sure I will find more in my next one). The story is just fantastic, I couldn't ask for more from a storyline. The game makes you want to read every little lore book and just learn more and more about anything and everything going on. And if you're an Original Sin fan, there's little pieces of lore left around everywhere for you to prick your ears up at and get excited about (and then some!).   Then there's the combat. It's fantastic. It's incredibly strategic in every aspect. Your first playthrough on Tactician will give you some good laughs at some of the difficulty you need to face and work around (this is a good thing! My boyfriend and I faced some extremely hilarious moments of trying to figure out a fight and failing miserably when we were learning the game, it was amazing fun). And then you enter the realm of searching out perfect gear, perfect min-maxing, perfect stats, and perfect combat. That, in itself, is the most enjoyable aspect of the combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2. You can hop from easier combat to the most intense combat the game offers, and it's all fun. I recently finished my solo Honour Mode, and it was definitely hard and an adventure and left me sitting during quite a few fights thinking out beforehand how I was going to handle them because even the smallest mistake can mess you up. I can go on and on about how amazing the combat is, but you really just need to delve into it yourself to truly see how remarkable it is. I can't find anything I enjoy as much as D:OS2's combat system anywhere else.  If you're looking for a game to literally lose yourself in for long periods of time, or to even play casually in your free time, this is definitely my go-to. This is just a masterpiece of a game, it's every fantasy and rpg player's dream come true. And did I mention the co-op is incredibly fun? Really, it's just a stunning piece of art.  Now, I have a great many pros for D:OS2, but I do have a few cons, and these are entirely subjective, and my own personal opinion.  I really don't enjoy the four-man party system. For someone like me, it's way too overwhelming managing four characters at all times, and I just don't like it. Because some best in slot gear pieces are unique and you won't find ANYTHING else with their bonuses on in the game (Second Skin, ihu), you're just sacrificing too much playing a full four-man. But that's from a min-maxing perspective, and probably not that important to others. The second part of why I don't like the four-man parties is because once you get a taste of the solid power of a Lone Wolf character, you really can't ever go back. Now this can be a good or bad thing. It gives the game a lot of replayable value, I'm about to hit my 5th playthrough and I'm finally needing to stray away from my babe Sebille ( ): ), which pushes me to pick other players to experience their stories.   With all that being said, this is definitely a game I recommend anyone to buy. It's amazing in every aspect. I absolutely cannot wait until the Definitive Edition either. And big, big props to Larian Studios for their choice to give the buyers of D:OS2 the Definitive Edition for free. Incredible company who listens to their audience. I can't wait to see what future games come!"

Zant,142,139,15,June 3,Recommended,180.3,"I cannot recommend this game enough. It is an RPG that breaks the boundaries of what you perceive an RPG to be. Every problem or puzzle has what feels like more solutions than you can conceive of. Original Sin 2 rewards clever thinking, tactics, and the role-playing itself over all else. Stat building and creating the ""perfect character"" is always a fun aspect of CRPGs but I'd say it's not the main focus here. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of numbers and plenty to min-max, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much damage you do if you're not in combat, and the game truly shines when you can avoid it.  Don't get me wrong, the combat in this game is fantastic. You can control all of your (up to 4) party members individually outside of combat and prepare the upcoming battlefield to your liking assuming you have the drop on your opponents. Place your archers up top, give your wizards ample space, have clean terrain for your warriors, e.t.c. However, when you find yourself able to circumvent combat, you'll be rewarded with a level of satisfaction very rare in games these days.  It constantly feels like Original Sin 2 almost dares you to break the game's boundaries. It challenges you to out-think the developers. Everything matters in this game. I'll leave you with an anecdote:  As I explored, searching for a quest target, I came upon a ruin. I saw a passage through, but in between it and myself were a few foes I was most certainly not equipped to handle at my current level. In other games I'd probably have left and came back later when I was a higher level, but not here. I navigated around the edges of the NPCs' detection radius in stealth with each of my characters individually until I found a minuscule spot I could teleport to that would get me past my foes. It was certainly inconvenient, but it worked - I painstakingly teleported each of my characters in turn to that one spot only to realize the one doing the teleporting was stuck below; the one casting the spell is unable to use it on themselves. After some hard thought I realized I could place the teleportation artifact close enough for my previously transported characters to grab. I then used it to pull my last hero past the baddies. I exhaled a sigh of relief and then panned the camera to see I had just come face-to-face with the very character I had been trying to track down. I was positively oozing with smugness."

It's significantly better than the first, which I found enjoyable but didn't fall in love with.  It had so much potential, but never really seemed to get there.  This gets there - right away.

saturn missiles,183,253,2,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,341.5,"Simply put, Divinity: Original Sin 2 expands on the best ideas from the first game while taking a complete 180 in tone to deliver a much darker and adult experience compared to the first.  One of the most notable changes is immediately realized as character creation begins, with races, tags, origin stories, and a complete stat revamp giving a new level of depth to character creation. The origin story presets, while not customizable, deliver a unique experience for each. All of the notable ""origin story"" characters have interactions with each other, and even if you choose not to create them yourself, they can be found and interacted with around the world. Not only this, but you can recruit these important figures of the lore. Origin stories on the surface level seem gimmicky, but allow for a whole new level of replayability, in combination with the tag system. The tag system allows you to acquire new tags that effect quests and dialogue as you progress through the game, or assign them to your custom character in character creation. ""Origin story"" characters will have these tags preset, as well as a brief synopsis of their lore.   However, the changes aren't just to the character creation. As soon as you get into combat, you'll quickly notice how much has changed. While Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps the basics of the first game intact, action points have recieved a complete overhaul, streamlining the process of choosing actions. While the new system (6 action points total; 4 action points at the start of encounter. Most skills cost 1-2 action points) may seem to cater to a more casual audience at first, the new skills that accompany this revamp allow for a level of complexity in combat never before seen in the Divinity series. New skills introduced in the second game are more ambitious, creative, and innovative than any in the first game. Even from the start of the game, you'll acquire interesting abilities that you can use to control the battlefield. The new targeting system provided in D:OS2 gives a sense of clarity lacking in the first game. Height advantages and disadvantages means that positioning matters now more than ever before. In addition to the ""surfaces"" system of the first game (fire, poison, poison clouds, static clouds, electrified water, etc), most of these surfaces can now be blessed and cursed for interesting variations and choice in combat. For example, while fire is harmful to your team, if you bless it, it'll apply a heal every turn and prevent the members within from being frozen.   The campaign here is of absolutely astounding quality and length - my first full playthrough of the game took roughly 80 hours, even without dozens of sidequests. No matter your choice of origin character or custom, you'll find the campaign to be deeply satisfying. However, as noted by the developers, you are meant to play with the origin story characters - and it shows. Each origin character has at least half a dozen unique encounters. While the game is still engaging if you're playing as a custom character, the origin stories really do allow for a better capacity for role playing and it's interaction in the game world.  For the Steam Awards of 2016, this is my pick for the Most Astounding Game. The staggering amount of interactions in the game, even in alpha, can be overwhelming. Divinity: Original Sin 2 could very well shape up to be Game of the Year 2017 for me."

The way spells and combat with your party work together is just amazing. It really opened my eyes and maybe once I am done with this one I will go back and play the first. Might do that now that there is a sale!  The story is well done so far and writing is top notch. Graphics are nice and the world seems so alive. So many side quests I am still in the first area.    Performance is great, I am getting solid FPS (between 80-120) all settings maxed out in 1440. The soundtrack is great as well.

Ex Nihiloish,295,"2,143",827,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,220.5,"I'm 72 years old and these have been the best 20 hours of my life.  EDIT:: After playing through the game multiple times, including finishing it on Honour Mode, I have to say that my opinion of this game is even higher than it was after those first 20 hours. After finishing this game, it feels like my life is complete and there's nothing left to live for. This may be the last game I ever play and review I ever write. I would like to thank Larian for filling a void that has been plaguing me for more than half a century.  I found the main story as well as every single side quest/story to be fun and interesting. There are no boring fetch quests as far as I can tell. How you handle side quests and whether you complete them or not 'does' affect the ending; as such, they could be considered extensions of the main story. (You could be unsatisfied with the ending if you just rush through and skip things.)  You can build your characters any way you see fit and almost any build is completely viable. If you don't like the way you built your characters, just wait until you complete Act 1 and you can rebuild them any way you want as frequently as you want all the way up to the very end of the game; this is very good for testing new things out. By the end of the game my main character was a fire breathing Geo/Pyro battle mage that wielded a fire staff, used Warfare skills and showered my enemies in meteors with some necromancy for physical damage in case the enemy had too much resistance to those elements; she was pretty godly. I plan on trying a solo Honour mode run next with a similar but more diverse build. (I love the lizards!)  For me, the best part of this game is the combat. It's extremely well done and very fun. I can't really say any more than what the other reviews cover though. Just know that if a fight seems absolutely impossible, that it really isn't. I've gone into fights where half my party was annihilated before I got to do anything, yet I still emerged victorious. There's always a way to win even if the enemy has you outnumbered and outleveled; just gotta think!  Like many reviews state, there are still some bugs. As far as I can tell, they are all minor. After multiple play throughs on multiple difficulties I have not experienced any major bugs. Nothing game breaking and nothing that really affected my gameplay much.  The few bugs I've experienced:  - Many unvoiced lines in Arx.  - Incorrect journal entries.  - Sometimes a character would act blind in combat even though they weren't (could't use any ranged skills, couldn't see around themselves, but this was rare and only lasted a single turn.)  - Sometimes the enemy AI would derp out and they'd just run around or repeatedly climb up and down a ladder until they were out of AP.  - Custom undead characters do not receive the appropriate immunities, such as bleeding and suffocation. (though I don't recall any of my characters ever being afflicted with Bleed...) (Fane does receive these immunities)  - Undead afflicted with Decay will not attempt to avoid poison puddles (Not sure if this is a bug or an oversight).  - Altitude does not affect many player or enemy melee attacks. (Entities 10+ meters above can be struck with melee.) But it does affect some skills, such as Dragon's Blaze, Laser Ray, charging skills, Battle Stomp, etc.  ... I think that's about it. I'll add more if I remember them.  Some reviews complain about enemies being omniscient and knowing all of your strengths and weaknesses (including whether you're undead or not), which is true, but it's also true for players. Any player with Loremaster on one of their characters can examine any NPC or enemy to gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Only one of your characters needs Loremaster. If you examine with someone that doesn't have it, they use the skill level of whoever does, even if that person is dead. (This even works on the final boss, at no point in the game is it unfair that enemies can spot your weaknesses.)  So in summary, very fun game, great character customization, great combat, good story, a few minor bugs. It can be challenging in some scenarios but it's supposed to be; that's at least half the fun. I could mention the poor inventory management but countless reviews already cover that.  Tip: Carry a couple pieces of +Thievery and +Loremaster gear with you to make sure you can pick any lock and identify any item. There may be times when your base skill isn't sufficient.   TL;DR: Recommended, as shown above. 10/10 on the Completely Subjective, Arbitrary and Useless rating system."
TeaBagTom,146,63,1,"September 28, 2016",Recommended,68.3,"Ok...so beat act 1, and holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•larian out did themselves. Everything from the atmosphere to the character building has been improved, using the same formula as before and making every aspect better. The combat is the same style but with many subtle at first differences that expand into a lot more combat flexibility.   Update (Release): The game has finally released and I really have to say...Larian has out-done themselves. Playing through the game on Tactician and seeing how the AI does its best to break the combat system like a real player would, ending their turn with their back to a wall so your rogue is inefective, reversing your moves by throwing water on the enemy you just shocked and stunning your entire party, it's an incredible system that Larian has created so much flexibility, every move of every fight becomes a question of ""did that just happen? can I really do this?"" which is something no other game can capture.  Gone are the supercharged ridiculous characters of the first game, replaced with smarter and more adept enemies that force you to make better decisions. The flexibility in character creation and the much more intuitive world makes me excited every chance I get to jump on and uncover just a bit more of the world. The inclusion of a darker story and races adds a much needed party diversity and the lore being less silly pulls you in far more to the atmosphere (which is beautiful...from the musical score to the graphics) creating a much more enjoyable transition from combat to exploring, and giving you more to WANT to explore.   The beautiful score and excellent voice acting talent (so far) has been an incredible treat in an age when games have been spending less and less time and devotion to world building and character development. The party while smaller than some CRPGs, is fully fleshed out with interesting characters who I actually want to talk to and interact with.  So far I am incredibly excited with the release and looking forwarding to simply getting through ACT 1 on tactician and exploring the unknown. Well done Larian, you have brought art back into the gaming industry."
AKatarzynaK,681,152,4,"October 21, 2017",Recommended,114.5,"This is without a doubt one of the best RPGs I have ever played and after completing it I can honestly say it has secured its place among my top favorite games of all time.   When beginning the game you have the option of creating your own character or choosing from one of several premade characters, each with their own unique backstories and questlines. I highly recommend going this route as these characters and their quests are very well written and interesting. I found myself extremely invested in my main character (Lohse) and what would become of her and her companions. It's also really interesting witnessing the members of your party, each with their own motivations and biases, try to work together while also clashing as they look out for their own best interests. Each character is so well written and perfectly voice acted that it really helped make what is already such an immersive game feel even more alive. The dialogue is great, whether it be the main characters or random NPCs, it really feels like everyone has their own unique personality.  The gameplay is incredibly fun, and I really can't think of the last time I had such a hard time putting down a game. You are given a lot of freedom, leaving it entirely up to you how you choose to progress throughout the world. There are often numerous ways to complete one task, depending on just how creative or good/evil you want to be. To add to this, the choices you make actually have consequences, and sometimes the line between what is right and what is wrong might not be so clear. So you will sometimes find that a decision you made might come back to haunt you in one way or another. I loved this and it was really cool seeing how some of the choices I made previously came to have a much wider impact than I had originally imagined.  The turn-based combat system is really well done and there are lots of ways in which you can get creative and use the environment to your advantage. Each battle is well designed and interesting, with each type of enemy presenting their own unique strengths and weaknesses. You have to really put some thought into exactly how you design your group, providing for a nice amount of strategy both in and out of battle. If you find that you have messed up your build there is an option to respec, something which I think most of us can appreciate for its ability to save us a lot of wasted time.  It is also worth mentioning that there are quite a few options as far as difficulty. I did my first playthrough on Classic, which is the default difficulty, and found it to be perfect for me. There were a few fights which I struggled on, but anytime I faced such a roadblock I found that all I needed to achieve victory was to simply reevaluate my strategy. Personally I love just how rewarding of a feeling this can be, and I look forward to doing future playthrough on the harder difficulties. However if you're someone who is looking for less of a hassle, you will be happy to find that the lower difficulty, Explorer, will allow you to simply enjoy the ride without any frustration.  The quests are extremely fun and varied, some of which require solving puzzles, riddles, or getting a bit more creative with your abilities and items. One thing I really loved about the quest system is that it doesn't hold your hand, meaning that unlike some RPGs that basically give you a GPS tracker showing you exactly where you need to go, this game tends to just point you in a general direction and expect you to figure it out on your own. Now if this is offputting to you, please know I am speaking as someone with a truly awful sense of direction. I had a ton of fun with this and found that getting lost while trying to find where I needed to go to next provided for some of my favorite moments. Some of the random encounters you come across as you explore are the most surprising and rewarding experiences in the game.   The attention to detail is truly incredible and the world really feels so alive. Even areas that at first glance appear to be devoid of life might have something hidden. Especially with the pet pal ability, which allows you to talk to animals, or spirit vision which allows you to see/speak to ghosts, you'll find that if you look close enough there is no shortage of things to be seen or done. And to top this all off the soundtrack is incredible, providing the perfect music to accompany you on what is truly an epic journey.  The universe that Larian have built here is absolutely astounding and they managed to pack so much into this game that it's honestly a bit overwhelming at times. Between all of the characters and their questlines, the decisions you have to make throughout the game, and the sheer size of the world, it's truly impossible to take it all in on just one run. Speaking as someone who rarely plays games a second time, I'm already gearing up for my second trip into Divinity Original Sin 2 and imagine I'll be making even more eventually.   Now that I've ranted and raved about just how much I adore this game I must point out really the only negative thing I have to say about it, and that is just how buggy it can be. During the course of my 111 hour playthrough I ran into a number of bugs, ranging from mildly annoying to gamebreaking. The biggest one, of course, being the gamebreaking bug which made it impossible for me to enter into a room you need to use to begin the final quest. In order to get around this I had to get a bit creative and basically stack items until I could get one of my characters to glitch into said room, then allowing the rest of my party to teleport to me. While I am obviously pleased that I was able to get past this annoying bug, I can't help but be frustrated that such a problem would even exist in the first place. For as much as I love this game some of the bugs I faced really took away from my overall enjoyment and I truly hope Larian will patch them as soon as possible. Of course I'm sure there are those who played the game without facing bugs, but it doesn't change the fact that I was unfortunate enough to encounter them and that some of you might as well.   Overall I truly love this game and believe it deserves all of the praise it is getting. As I mentioned, my one and only complaint are some of the bugs I encountered. While frustrating, such issues can easily be fixed through a patch. And it does speak to just how captivating I found this game to be that I continued to press on despite these issues. There is absolutely no denying that this was a game crafted with a lot of love, and so I have complete faith that Larian will continue to be very active in it post release. If you're on the fence than I suggest you wait a bit to buy, but I imagine it won't take long for these issues to be fixed. For 45 Euro I managed to get one of the most amazing gaming experiences I have ever had and I encourage everyone who is interested to give it a try. This game is a masterpiece, plain and simple."

It's a bit different than your classic CRPG, the main story doesn't seem that extraordinary, but it grows on you. It's not what makes the game good. The journey is.  - You have multiple ways to achieve things. Want to steal a chest without being seen? Teleport it away from affar. Want to blow up a door but it has too much HP? Blow it up with an explosive barrel.  Want to escape a keep of evil clerics? Well I'll let you figure that one out for yourself, you'll have many ways to chose from. - The voice acting is great considering how little budget they had compared to triple A companies. - Every NPC has something to say.  - The writting is just right, and very immersive. - Remember the combat in Torment:Tides of Numenera? Wipe that nightmare out of your memory with the combat in this game. It's fun, complex and actually makes  you look forward to battles. - Each companion is unique and complex.

Retrotus,222,172,6,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,38.7,"If you want good old classical RPG feel that does not kill your smart with stupid RNG, If you want something that is not just rush in and kill everything and be a godlike all the time, if you really think that games nowadays has made you dumb and numb, then Divinity 2 is for you.  For example my experience so far has been..  I chose tactician difficulty as it said enemies will use tricks that they wont otherwise. i played few hours and was about to lower my difficulty from tactician and now i'm glad that i did not. It really makes you save scumming A LOT, but other hand it forces you to learn some dirty tricks to defeat enemies as they really do some dirty hoccus poccus to you. The difficulty lives by it name 100% in this game imo  It forces you kind a explore world more to find out ways to beat something that serves your royal head in a plate.. And when you do that you find some many interesting stuff from the game world that you would probably just missed. Mostly in other games exploring just feels kind a work but not in this one, it's rewarding  There has been many fights that i had to delay due lvl difference and bad gear, Fights that i need to find an alternative way to approach. Some situations feels so unfair until you really think it through. For me it is just pure joy, wanted so long something that is not just blatant rush in and slice everything or that stupid RNG kills your smart moves, it's you and your stupid moves and strategies what gets you killed.. and ofc i can blame a bit other games that has made your brain so dry for new ideas ;)  Same style goes with conversations. Listen what they have to say, it might help you later.. No it will help you later. Books, notes etc is rewarding to read as they can have life saving info or ways to unlock some puzzles later on. Sometimes even info about NPCs in game world wich you can use to get their favor in conversation. No, the game does not unlock conversation choises when you find info about people. For long time i haven't read so many diaries in game that i have in this game so far! Voice acting is not annoying to listen. DOS1 gave me that feel i was listening shakespeare but in this on they nailed it.  What i can say...  The victory is like drug now,  every nook and corner is my friend,  every item that is not nailed down is my salary or key to success,  every book or note makes me a bit more aware of the world in game. every stronger enemies that slain my team is like tasty revange when you come to beat them later on!  10/10 in my book  PS. if you are new to Divinity Orginal Sin, Tactician difficulty can be a bit harsh first ;)"
Riptide,61,248,8,August 4,Recommended,195.5,"After playing this game for a few weeks, I can say that DOS2 has replaced Skyrim as my all time favorite RPG. It's that good.  Pros: Voice acting, graphics, ""turn based"" combat, immersion factors all get a solid 10. I haven't finished the game, but so far the story is interesting, and even if the story ending stinks, it still has that draw you in factor. As for re-playability, it's already apparent to me that I'll have to play it again with the other available characters so I can experience their stories. There is the main story line, and each of the 5 pre-created characters have their own stories. I chose to create my own character, which means I have 3 of the 5 available pre-created characters as my compatriots, each with their own stories to be completed. With my current playthough, I'm not going to know how Sebille or Lohse's stories finish out. They're not in my party so, I gotta play again with them to find out how their stories end.  An EXTREMELY well crafted RPG. This one is a clear and unmistakable winner. Kudos to Larian for self-publishing to avoid the pressure to release the game before they completed what they intended the game to be. You guys got it correct.  Although I'm not a fan of third person, overlooking the party, view point games (I prefer first person... eyeballs forward),  this one succeeds in grasping my attention and refusing to let it go. I'm drawn in, focused, worried, and sssso happy when a fight is over and all the characters under my control are still alive, I'm almost bouncing up and down in my seat ready for the loot.   It's a blast to play!   The only downside I've felt so far - and it's not really terrible - is inventory management. There's a load of stats, and as with any RPG, we all want all the stats to be as high as possible. Well, it ain't gonna happen. There's the agonizing struggle around applying the puny number of level up points to a plethora of possibilities. And, the loot that's uncovered has a variety of statistical applications that can be distributed to... well... do I want this? Who best to give it to? Arrrrgh! I like those extra points with that, but this one has these two stats.... which one to choose? Maybe I could give it to this character... but then I lose those stats. Grrrrr! Maybe I should keep it for later on? No. Maybe I'll just sell it. No... should I wait? Maybe it'll be useful in this situation? What... ever.... should.... I... do??? **blank it*** I'll just sell it. No, I'll keep it for later. ARRRGH!!!  It's involved, at times frustrating, and can be overly time consuming. There's so many items that can enhance a variety of disparet statistics, it can be overwhelming. It's like a 20 page menu of delicious food at a great restaraunt to a starving man. I WANT IT ALL!!!  I've always been of the opinion that less is more. This game does not embrace that. There's a lot of items, that do a lot of different things, and I've probably spent more time trying to figure out who should get what, for the maximum impact, than I've spent exploring.  I'm not really unhappy about that though. For me, it's at most a minor annoyance. There is a crafting mechanism that I could take a deep dive into, which some people will do because they like exploring that type of mystery. Me? I try not to be an item hoarding ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but ultimately I lose out on certain discoveries. But hey, it's all good y'know? I may miss out on a side quest here or there, but there's too much other content to discover so even though I've ""broken"" a few side quests so far, I've forgotten about them so I just press onward with the quests that are currently before me.  Let me put it this way: Inventory management can be tedious, but if you ""explore"" it, certain items can open additional quests. Sheesh! As if there wasn't enough to do already!  Oh, and if you put a point into Pet Pal, you can talk to the animals. Which open up probably a few dozen side quests to have fun with. I mean, why wouldn't you? There's only a hundred quests along the way, so why not open up a few dozen more??? Awww... go on! You got the time!  This game is easily worth the current price of around $40. My favorite gaming experiences have been with RPG's, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now my favorite of all time.  Well done Larian!"
Emperor Gandhi,281,137,2,May 20,Recommended,104.4,"Like my reviews? Go follow my Curator page.   As a younger gamer, I never got to experience games like Diablo 2 or Baldur's Gate in their prime, and by the time I was old enough to understand and appreciate the RPG genre, the gaming industry moved onto 3D, first/third-person RPGs like Fallout 3 and Oblivion. Eventually, CRPGs made a comeback, and I jumped onto that hype train only to be pretty disappointed. As other CRPGs haven't quite hit the spot for me, I saw this game get released on Steam and chose not to buy it because I thought I'd be underwhelmed yet again.  That was a huge mistake. While Divinity: Original Sin 2 suffers from some very serious flaws, the game's strengths are done so well that the fairly popular claim that this game is one of the ""best RPGs of all time"" is completely justified.  Graphics As was the case with the first game, the visuals are surprisingly pretty. Even though the overall tone of this game is rather dark (especially compared to D:OS 1) it still retains some of the first game's light-hearted charm and this can be reflected in the bright, cartoony visuals. The main characters are all interesting and unique visually, and the character creation system itself is incredibly deep from an appearance standpoint. Aside from some occasional frame drops, the game is pretty impressive visually.  Gameplay Divinity: Original Sin 2's biggest strength, one that makes it one of the all-time greats, is its incredible amount of player choice. This is reflected in almost every aspect of the game. The addition of physical and magic armor means that you're going to need to think a little bit more when it comes to party composition and prioritizing targets, while simply stunlocking an enemy to death isn't as effective now. On top of this, with the sheer amount of skills in the game, there are so many different ways to approach a situation. For example, you could hack away at a troll, or you could turn him into a chicken and teleport him into a pit of lava. Or, you could summon a monster (one that's just as large as that troll) on top of a fire, causing the monster to be infused with fire, and have the two duke it out with each other. The variety in skills adds so much depth to the already refined turn-based combat mechanics of the first game. While some skills and talents are better than others, the classes overall are pretty fairly balanced and offer you a lot of wiggle room to make your characters more well-rounded, and the weaker skills/talents are still playable at least. The game is also difficult, but it very rarely felt unfair. Even then, thanks to the incredible amount of choice in this game, you can easily exploit these unfair fights. Where the game falls flat gameplay-wise, however, is the final boss. Without going into spoilers, it takes the biggest strengths of this game and throws them out the window, turning into an absolute mess where you barely get to do anything. Overall though, aside from the final boss, everything in the gameplay department is perfect. The combat mechanics are deep and incredibly fun, the game overall is mostly fairly balanced, the armor system makes the game more interesting, and the sheer amount of choice makes just about anything possible. The gameplay alone makes this game worthwhile at full price, and the enhanced edition should (hopefully) make it even better.  Story Unfortunately, on the other end of the spectrum, the weakest part of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is its story. While the writing is good and the pacing starts off fairly consistent, this all goes out the window for the last third of the game. From the big climax in Act 3 and onward, the pacing goes all over the place. Act 3 as a whole is over extremely quickly, while Act 4 is drawn out some more but still fairly easy to blow through. As mentioned before, the final boss takes the biggest strengths and throws them out the window, and this includes the writing. As an example of this, one of my party members told my character that he would support me no matter what decision I made, only to get mad at me for choosing something he apparently didn't support. This happened over the span of about 30 seconds, and I'm not exaggerating that either. All of the character development of your party members is thrown aside for some reason, and it makes the finale that much more frustrating. On top of this, none of the endings are satisfying. While I understand the approach they tried to take, the drop in quality of the writing made all of them feel stupid and nullified all the progress you made in the game. However, everything else is great. Fort Joy was brilliant, and I loved watching the island slowly open up for you to explore as you escaped it. Driftwood, while definitely a lot slower paced, was filled to the brim with entertaining quests and the classic D:OS charm. Plus, the amount of player choice is also reflected here. You can talk your way out of a situation in a wide variety of different ways, and your decisions do have weight to them. Overall, while the first two acts of the game are incredible, the last two are not as great and will likely leave you disappointed.  Audio Remember how I said that almost everything in this game could be changed by the player? Well I wasn't kidding. You can choose your character's instrument, which plays during the battle (to the music) when you kill an enemy. I also personally find it pretty impressive how much of this game is voice acted. With the exception of a few conversations, almost everything has competent voice acting. Another pleasant suprise was how much I enjoyed the soundtrack. While I liked the first game's music, not much stuck out for me aside from the classic tavern music and the main menu theme. In this game, however, I found myself humming along to music like the Lady Vengeance theme and the tavern battle theme. While neither of these things are major highlights to the game, they're both done very well and do make the experience significantly more entertaining as a result.  Replayability As choice is this game's biggest strength, the replayability for D:OS 2 is very high, moreso than most other RPGs in my opinion. There's no way you can see or do everything in a single playthorugh, plus the party member quests are entertaining enough that you'll probably want to see them through for every character. Plus, with the inclusion of the excellent Game Master mode, even if you don't do multiple playthroughs of the game, you'll be spending hours on top of hours in this game. There's so many different combinations of classes and skills that experimenting is incredibly fun, and so you'll definitely have a lot of motivation to play through the game again.  Verdict To conclude, while Divinity: Original Sin 2 suffers from things like frame drops and an incredibly weak finale, the game's strengths overshadow its weaknesses so much that I still wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who might even be remotely interested. People weren't kidding, this truly is one of the best RPG games ever made, and the enhanced edition has the potential to make it the best.

It would be more appropriate to say that I've been 'content' with the games I play now and leave it at that.  Well, that is not the case with Divinity: Original Sin 2.   I'm quite envious of the fact that I was not involved with the design of this game. It has exceeded my expectations and provided me with many hours of gaming pleasure. I can only hope and pray that future sequels, please let there be more to come, are of equal or greater quality.  Thank you Larian for the many hours of gaming pleasure I have received from this game. Please keep up the good work. My sincere compliments to you and your staff."
Damashi The Kaotic,89,114,8,"June 24, 2017",Recommended,"1,284.0","Play it...just play it. This is easily one of the greatest rpgs ever made, and I would recomend it to litteraly everyone. If you like a great story, great turn based combat with an insane amount of depth, and beautiful visuals, you will fall in love with this game as much as I did.  I've played through DOS1/DOS EE around 7 times, and while the story in that game was unintresting, the gameplay alone kept me coming back. DOS2, even in its alpha state, is a vast improvement over DOS1/DOS EE in everyway.  Kill whoever you want, steal whatever isn't nailed down, Dos2 gives more freedom than any rpg to date.  *Slight Spoilers*: You can kill the gaurds on the boat, and the game has dialouge to reflect that you did. You can also kill your companions on the boat or leave them to die, and there is special dialouge for both of these actions.  Update: After having finished the full game I can safely say this is my favorite rpg of all time, period. Larian did an icredible job with this game, and its very obvious just how much love and care went into this game.  Update as of Nov 24th 2017: I've now put in over 600 hours in and I still can't stop playing it. When I'm not playing it I'm think about, and if that's not an indication of this game's quality I don't know what is. This is my game of the century, and Larian Studios has given me hope for the game industry. This is a must buy, especially if you want to give the middle finger to scummy publishers who fill their games with microtransactions, loot boxes, and other anti consumer pratices. A few bugs here and there, but nothing that truly detracts from the over all experience, and the game is patched roughly once, and Larian is one of the few publishers that I trust to fix everything (even if things that are wrong are miniscule)."

wcis,339,100,3,"November 7, 2017",Recommended,151.6,"An adventure! If I had to describe Divinity: Original Sin 2 in a word, that would be it. An adventure. Without a doubt, it‚Äôs the best modern cRPG game up to date. And as an oldschool gamer, I can understand when someone is saying that nothing can stand in one line with games like Planescape: Torment or Baldur‚Äôs Gate. Well, it couldn‚Äôt. Until now. Times changing, and so gaming industry is changing. And we have just received the best, most polished cRPG game ever made. It has to be said, even if we are sentimental.   The world of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is full of content and what‚Äôs the best, we can interact with almost everything and everyone. There are no boring NPC‚Äôs with exactly the same dialogue lines. In this game everyone is unique and has something to say. Also, we are talking here about huge cRPG game that is fully voice acted (!) and it‚Äôs not Oblivion-like voice acting with 5 actors. The main narrator, who is with us most of the time, and all the other voice actors, did an outstanding job here. Every character sounds special.  If you have played first Original Sin you know what to expect from fights. They can be approached in many different ways. Even in tough fights, one properly used scroll or skill can change everything. Of course in both ways, because we can easily lose. The fights are hard, made to think in strategic ways and what‚Äôs the most important, they are very satisfying. Comparing to other cRPG games it‚Äôs one of the best parts of Divinity.  It took me roughly 105 hours to finish the game once, so it can be said that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the biggest cRPG games. What‚Äôs more, this game has high replayability value. Every character has its own personality and its own origin story. By playing with different characters we have new quests and we can approach many situations in totally different way ‚Äì origin characters have their own interactions across whole game. The main story is interesting and I have never lost my interest. I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything, but it‚Äôs just really good piece of writing. Side quests are keeping high level as well. Same as in first Original Sin, we also receive minimal amount of help in all the quests. We have to think, search and read. Just like in real cRPG game.  I have completed this game few days ago and to be honest, I can‚Äôt wait to play it again. I am thinking about new characters and about making different decisions in several points of the game. It‚Äôs something amazing. There are many huge games, like The Witcher 3 or Fallout 4 that can give you +/- 100 hours of actual playtime, but those are mostly single experience games. You are not playing them again. There is something different in Divinity that make you want to play it again. More and more! In Civilization series we are saying about ‚Äúone more turn‚Äù syndrome. Here we have ‚Äúone more hour‚Äù, ‚Äúone more evening‚Äù and ‚Äúone more day syndrome‚Äù!  There are no perfect, 10/10 games, and there is no difference here. The game is quite fresh, so there are still bugs. I haven‚Äôt experienced any gamebreaking bug though, but there are many small things that for sure will be fixed in the future. What‚Äôs more, the final act and final battle are both the weakest parts of the game. You can feel that devs were in hurry here, but on the other side, whole game is so good, that this ‚Äúrushed‚Äù ending won‚Äôt outshine beautiful, interesting and so carefully designed game. It simply can‚Äôt.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is, in my humble opinion, the best game of year 2017. Let‚Äôs just hope we will see more cRPG‚Äôs like this in the future (Obsidian, we are looking at you). Do yourself a favour and buy this game. It will be the best +/- 100 hours you can have as a gamer. And for this price, that is not even close to the other ""AAA"" titles with unhealthy DLC policy, it's a steal.   Whoop. We've got quite a long review here! Enjoy the game! :)  9+/10  EDIT: Found typo."

Metsakurat,"1,205",46,0,October 17,Recommended,120.7,"A masterpiece It took me around 100 hours to finish the game. The world of Rivellon is both big and alluring. It was a joy to explore every single corner of it. Each battle was challenging, fun, made me use different tactics and I never got tired of fighting. The game balances roleplaying and combat perfectly. In some RPGs the combat is fine but the story and characters are what keep you playing. However in Original Sin 1 I didn't really care for the story while Original Sin 2 kept me interested at all times. It really improves on the lore, roleplaying and combat. It's definitely a good sequel and one of the best games of 2017.  I only have two complaints: Romance had no effect on the ending and the amount of puzzles in the game. It would have taken me A LOT more than 100 hours to finish the game because of the puzzles.  Now don't get me wrong. The puzzles are all interesting and well executed. There are some simple puzzles, moderate and very hard ones. I just don't have too much time to play video games and since there are so many puzzles in the game I had to resort to using Google way more than I'd like to admit. Now the romance and with it some minor spoilers ahead. I decided to romance Lohse. At the end of the game she asked me if I would like to travel the world with her and I can't answer her. All I can do is end the conversation and in the final cutscene the narrator tells me that she spent the rest of her life traveling Rivellon alone.  Just dissapointing.  But what is the game about? What's the story like? You have the ability to use Source - A powerful and outlawed magic. Magic used by the gods themselves. It's what gives them power. The game starts with you being captured by Magisters who hunt and imprison everyone who can use Source. They take you to an isolated prison island. While there you make new friends, discover an unbelievable truth about yourself and make interesting alliances while trying to escape the island. You will meet dragons, witches, paladins, underground fighting arenas, demons, trolls, ghosts and much, much more. You will also uncover conspiracies and astonishing secrets. Will you be the new Divine?  The game itself plays alot like the recent XCOM games. It's basically a turn-based roleplaying game. Not to worry tho. You can still create a custom character and choose their stats, race, gender, and origin story or you can simply choose one of the pre-made characters. There's a wide variety of classes to choose from as well. All your favourate melee, ranged and magic classes are there. It also has Steam Workshop and modders have made some really interesting class mods that are worth checking out. However, if you enable mods you are not able to earn achivements. This, in my humble opinion, is a bit foolish. It's a singleplayer game and I should be allowed to have my fun however I want. The trainers still work and it has no leaderboards in it so I don't really support disabling achivements for mod users. It's a minor complaint but a complaint nonetheless.  The game is well optimised and ran at a solid 60 frames per second at all times. I did experience two crashes during my playthrough but other than that I really didn't notice any other bugs or issues. Visually the game is lovely to look at and the soundtrack is marvelous. Don't go into it expecting remarkable next gen graphics though.  It's a game I most definitely won't forget any time soon. I want a sequel and I want it now! A must play for every roleplaying fan and fans of the turn-based genre should give it a go as well. Well done, Larian Studios, well done. "
Shard of Manus,41,75,1,March 13,Recommended,177.4,"Divinity Original Sin 2 - Larian's second foray into the grand re-imagining of the Divinity universe, and one can only say... they really outdid themselves this time.   Larian Studios takes a bold step into the old RPG style that players were so enamoured by with the original Divine Divinity, only with all the polish of modern capabilities, and the extremely successful and informative release of Divinity Original Sin (and its Enhanced Edition) granting them insight into the necessary improvements that make DOS2 the absolute masterpiece that it is.   Players can be sure to find themselves trapped within this game for such lengths of time that the outside world shall begin to pass by unnoticed, as one becomes so transfixed with the beauty of Larian's latest release. Divinity Original Sin 2 is perhaps the most engaging, exciting, satisfying and well-designed Adventure RPG of the decade... and that is quite the title to fight for.   -----------------   The world of DOS2 is massive. Hours upon hours upon hours of dense, creative and unique content stacked together in this vibrant and stunning game world. Every location itself is chock full of fantastic characters, all fully voiced with quality acting, and each with a rich and realistic personality and story that drive the player's desire to uncover every ounce of their story and build upon the deep lore and sprawling history of the world of Divinity.   The main campaign spans four Acts, each filled to the brim with hours of non-linear content including side quests, treasure hunts, battles, secrets to be uncovered and more all with multiples ways to be completed and numerous outcomes - and with such immense amounts of freedom and player choice, the likes of which almost no modern game can compete with, there really is no dull moment in Divinity, and this game is a shining example of the effort and dedication Larian puts into their work.   -----------------   The combat of DOS2 has been revamped since the previous release, though maintaining much of what it once was. Divinity Original Sin 2, like its predecessor, adopts turn-based combat, and turns it into one of the most finely crafted and perfect editions of this style of combat to date. Every moment of battle is exciting and even for one such as I, whom rarely plays turn-based games, the combat was astoundingly well designed and thoroughly enjoyable.   Players command all manner of skills thanks to the diverse customisation options available and freedom of choice, with crafting bombs, traps, potions, poisons, arrows and much, much more, players will always find themselves with an array of tools with which to combat the enemy. No class is tied to any particular tree of skills, and one can mix and match as they see fit... provided they learn how to best use such abilities.   DOS2 encourages interactivity with the environment, and players have much freedom to use objects, terrain and combinations of attacks for devastating effects. If there is oil, set it ablaze. If there is water, freeze it so that your enemies slip. The combinations are many, and are far deeper and complex than just those above. This game holds some of the most complex and intriguing combat systems I know.   Combat is by no means forgiving, and the game boasts a variety of difficulty options that make enemies easier, or expand their skills sets and AI intelligence such as that they pose worthy adversaries to even well skilled players.   -----------------   Something brought to players for the first time in Divinity Original Sin makes its triumphant return in DOS2, and that is the wonderfully designed multiplayer aspect. Drop-in / drop-out co-op allows players to seamlessly enter the world of another player and join them on their journey... be they ally or foe.   The multiplayer system is beyond extensive, and to the delight of some players, and the woe of others, players can act as friend or foe on their journey - and betrayal is a sweet thing.   The absolute freedom of the multiplayer system does have its faults however, as playing with strangers can sometimes lead to them rushing through things, progressing without you or making choices that you didn't want to make. It is highly recommended that players save co-op until after their first playthrough, or only play with friends that one can communicate with easily and rely on. DOS2s world is too big and too grand to risk someone spoiling it for you.   However, in my experience, playing DOS2 with a friend or two (or 3) is an inimitable experience that all should try. Working together or against one another towards the finale of this game is thrilling beyond imagination.   -----------------   So, alongside the beautifully crafted world, intricate characters, massive freedom of choice, expansive customisation and awesome combat, Divinity Original Sin 2, much like other installments in the series, boasts an amazing soundtrack.   Composed by Borislav Slavov, DOS2s soundtrack combines epic scores, emotional pieces and the jovial warmth of tavern music in one of the best compositions of the year and even beyond, rivalling that of Hollow Knight, NieR: Automata and potentially even the Witcher 3.   With traditional styles of RPG music reminiscent of golden oldies, each with its own unique flair and spark, and returning tracks from other Divinity titles, the music of Larian's latest game is something no-one will not enjoy. Hours of beautiful tracks, some of which are placed so heart-wrenchingly well within the game world that you will no doubt be straight onto YouTube and listening to the whole lot for hours.   With everything else DOS2 has to offer, the Soundtrack really is the cherry on top, and it is something to behold.   -----------------   To summarise Divinity Original Sin 2 into one word, it would have to be... brave. Larian Studios started the development of this game precariously, via Kickstarter backing; and after the amazing success of Divinity Original Sin, they had certainly garnered enough interest to support their new installment. Their return to old school RPG styles was a risk that paid off... not because the style is popular, but because Larian took something good, and turned it into something beyond great.   DOS2 is, and will no doubt remain for some time, among my favourite games of all time. I have sunk so many hours into this game, through several playthroughs and still each new one is unique and engaging. Here is a timeless game. Play it, with all my heart, I tell you to play it."
Squeaks,60,64,5,February 19,Recommended,77.4,"I am a very casual gamer. I played WoW many years ago obsessively, and since then have really only gotten into a couple of flings with games. As someone who works full time, I don't have the time (or, honestly, the interest) in playing a game that requires me to play ALL THE TIME to keep up with everyone else. Adversely, I'm usually pretty bored with single player games.  I also hate turn-based games.  Despite that, I was browsing the most-purchased in the Steam store and decided on buying this game after reading the reviews.   This game took me about a month to complete, and I clocked in 75 hours. I can't even remember the last time a campaign took me more than 8 hours.... I actually was interested in what NPC's had to say, talked to everyone, opened every chest, etc. Not because I felt I had to, but because I really loved the game that much. Also, if I had played this game without looking up most of the quests online, it would've taken me at least double that time.  The combat was super fun, even though it was turn based. I was constantly looking for new spellbooks, planning out my rotations, etc.  It was also challenging - I really had to make sure my party was well-equipped and balanced in their abilities.  There were some fights I had to retry a few times, and it felt like more of a fun challenge than a tedious part of the gameplay.    After finishing the game, I'm going to go back and replay it a second time with a different strategy and a slightly higher difficulty.

Just take some time off work and play this game... trust me.  The only danger here is that after I finished the game, I kinda feel like I'm done with gaming. I feel... complete, like every game I ever played was building up to this and nothing could ever be better than Divinity 2 (particularly Lohse's story arc). So, keep that in mind. You might be spoiled after playing."
iingaate,72,223,3,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,143.3,"First time reviewing a game, but felt I should on this one. I never did play the first game though heard good things about it, so figured give the second a run. So far...even in early access I can't say I was disappointed. The game it's self reminds me of classic computer RPGs and pen 'n paper RPGs I played when I was much younger just a bit more fair and easier to understand yet still maintaining a lot of what made them challenging. Character customization starts a bit limited but as you get higher in levels its more about what you want to play and what your party members be. You are not locked into your starting class at all and I love that, hoping they have a lot more choices in the full release.   Gameplay wise is point and click, though I found there is a lot to interact with in the world in different ways, one of the more different ways I found was that playing an Elf or having an Elf in your group, the elf can eat a corpse and gain the memories of that person, and it actually does play a part in the game. Combat is much of the same, point and click with a lot of tactical choices to make, the enemy AI is well refined and act in actually very smart ways even on the easier difficulties. I also found it pretty neat how your spells, items and attacks can change the battle ground and make hazards for yourself and your enemies, with the enemies able to do the same. Such as freezing a wet spot on the ground to give a chance of someone slipping on the spot or shocking the water with lighting to stun everyone standing in the wet spot. Though at times at least for me I found it hard to move to avoide these hazards at times like the area they were affecting were slightly larger than they really were.  I even tried a bit of co-op with friends and a bit hidden in a sense once we figured it out, connecting with one another was clean and easy to do.   Storywise I found interesting enough, a dark world with many dark themes with demons, torture and corruption. The premade characters have backgrounds and behave well according to their backgrounds. Another different system in this game is the tag system. Basicly pick tags for your character and you will have in game choices that you can make based just on those tags you pick. The pre mades having different choices as well they can make based on their stand alone backgrounds. Though it does feel you can get same results no matter your background still, it does help with immersion and at in making your created character feel seprate from the rest.   Graphics, are not that important to me, but they are decent enough in this game. Though playing completely zoomed out (pretty much the only way to play an RPG like this) I found it a bit difficult to notice things I could pick up or interact with since they are so small. A few rare times I misclicked on something because of how small it is. I have an older system, so I wasn't able to play on the highest settings, I was able to however able to play on high even though the game suggested I play on low. So I can see pretty much everyone able to play this game with no issues. Even when I tried the highest settings I just had a slight drop in Frame rate.  Overall Divinity 2 I recommend highly, especially if you are a fan of old school RPGs and Pen 'n Paper RPGs, you will feel right at home playing this with a high level of immersion and ability to costumize your character however you desire. Story had been done before but it's presented well in the world, and should be interesting enough to keep you playing. Combat is deep, and will challenge the thinking sides of your brain to approach each encounter in most effective way possible, plus have you thinking best way to build your characters to deal with threats in your prefered way. You might find a little frustration in interacting with the world due to how small things are and will even miss a few things if you aren't careful, but it shouldn't be a big enough issue to remove any enjoyment in the game.   Hope you found this helpful if you took the time to read it."
Athravan,"1,782",80,4,January 8,Recommended,99.9,"Now that 2017 is but a memory I can say with confidence that Divinity: Original Sin 2 was my Game of the Year. Although I backed the game on Kickstarter (just like the first) and had an Early Access copy, I didn‚Äôt play it until full launch so that I could fully immerse myself. And immerse myself I did into this high-fantasy adventure that manages to make the magical and fantastical feel realistic and gritty. It has taken everything that was good about Divinity: Original Sin and improved upon it, whilst also making it so you don‚Äôt need to have played the first in any way as it takes place a thousand years before.  Whether I‚Äôm following a quest that portrays me as the savior of the universe (hero complex much?) or trying to solve the angst of a tiny rat I really believe in my characters and their responses. There is a balance between the epic and the banal, the frivolous and the fateful that creates a woven world that is wonderful to experience.  In my first playthrough, co-op with a friend, I‚Äôm a summoner, focusing on gathering my minions. I‚Äôm a bit heavy handed though, I‚Äôll send my minions into battle at a moments notice from afar, but stand aside, watching the ebb and flow, supporting and commanding the field. I speak harsh truths and it frequently gets me into trouble even though I feel righteous. In my solo playthrough, I‚Äôm a morally ambiguous pickpocketing hitman with a deep, dark past that I‚Äôve blocked from memory. I fight with my words, and flirt with absolutely everyone, often getting what I desire in alternative ways. Even though the majority of the quests are the same on multiple playthroughs (bar the character story quests which too, are dark and deep), it feels different. Different dialogue and varying methods result in genuinely diverse results and that‚Äôs testament to the freedom, flexibility and depth of the game.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 rewards exploration and creativity as many side quests can only be discovered or completed by turning over every rock, talking to every NPC or trying things that are a little out of the box. This may frustrate some but delighted me at every stage. There are no glowing quest signs and immersion breaking yellow exclamation marks here. If you don‚Äôt like reading, that‚Äôs fine ‚Äì as everything is beautifully and uniquely voiceovered. But if you don‚Äôt like paying attention to detail, you‚Äôre going to miss out on a lot of the fun. This game is for people who like to genuinely invest their time and attention into the world they‚Äôre playing and the characters in it. Perhaps that, above all else is what reminds me of the D&D campaigns from my youth that I sorely miss.  Tactically the combat is as complicated as you make it, with different difficulty settings that cater to your preference for challenge. You can brute force things if you‚Äôre so inclined, but you‚Äôre rewarded for playing smart at any level and the game gives you the tools to feel like a tactical genius, with a deep satisfaction when you pull off a clever combo.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 has the old school charm of Baldur‚Äôs Gate and Planescape Torment but with modern mechanics and beautiful aesthetics, I finally feel like an RPG has surpassed them. It only took a few decades for us to get here. I wonder if this is the pinnacle of the genre and how long it‚Äôll be before I can say that about a game again.   ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• If you find the reviews of an old Welsh lady interesting, please follow  My Curator Page.

I don't like tedious quests, I dont like common NPC stereotypes, I hate lousy combat mechanics and poor strategy, and above all else I hate it when a game plays like it literally cant spell ""scenario"".  But raising a baby demon chicken to conquer the world and tele-rob ignorant merchants? Igniting grenades in people's pockets and befriend a cat for no effing reason ? Just cause you know, he's like mysterious and all? And he's a really good looking cat, all the while being lectured by a crab? Oh, and trying to become a demigod and save the world, apparently  insane pathing possibilities (OH DEAR TP) Well rounded scenario, emo NPCs that drink blood or are possessed by demons like it's totally fine, and GOD the landscapes!!! I did spend a whole 10 minutes exploring a map and praising its beauty before remembering I had entered a fight. Hell, I just like clicking a spell and not actually launching it cause the casting animation is then suspended and they're F***ING MAGNIFICENT (not as much as my cat, tho. He's a nice cat.)  So yeah, Maybe it's a bit too much, maybe it's been written a hundred times but playing this in coop mode was (one of?) the best gaming experience in my entire life. Entertaining, challenging, captivating, and of course it makes no sense sometimes cause you keep doing awesome tricks with your cat to try F**KING with the scenario. But you know what? It adapts to all the sh*t you do. It gets your sh*t together. It gets it all together, puts it in a backpack, all your sh*t, so it's all together. And then it makes wonders from out of nowhere and you're like ""but I was trying to act crazy! And I did! And still, cool sh*t keeps happening! It's a F***ING transsh*itation!!! Like alchemy or something!""  It's beautiful, smart sometimes even touching, funny as hell, and you know the best part? It has a cool cat. And it's nice.  And hidden quests, and insane replayability, and nutsy combos, and a perfect leveling/reroll system, and Malady is kinda sexy but like, not entirely but that's okay. And talking boat, and a condor, a phoenix omelett and A CAT. AND GODS AND ALL BUT A CAT MOSTLY. And you know what? THE CAT REALLY IS IMPORTANT!!!! I mean even a common (though really nice) cat DOES HAVE its own scenario and voice acting!! Cause every EFFING DIALOG has voice acting!!! like hours of it!  This is your best investment this year and if you have a friend that you like and he likes good ol RPGs like you (Baldur's gate, Neverwinter Night, Icewind Dale's fans, I'm looking right at yo, dawgs), buy it and offer it like my friend offered it to me.

Kodijack!,"2,014",203,10,"October 2, 2017",Recommended,156.2,"(Remark 1: I never tried the game in EA. I knew it was wiser to wait for full release. So everything here bases on the final thing  Remark 2: I don't give a damn about hype or hate. I usually don't read a single word about a game prior to purchase and decide to purchase based on experience and judgement of the presentation. And due to high age and experience I usually don't fail there hehe) )  Woah! What a masterpiece RPG. I really already liked the first DOS (and its predecessors, although completly different, too). And I'm not much into turn-based top-down (more or less, I know it's 3D) RPGs at all. And this time they really managed to drag you into their world. Many races, interesting locations, tons of secrets, tons of sidequests, billions of lines of conversations... It's not a perfect game, and surely has some tiny flaws, but the overall experience damn rocks. That love for all those details. Like at some point there is a Pianist-ghost (which you don't see usually without a skill) and beside her is a book of Kirill's (*sigh*) best songs. And you can ask her to play those. And she does. Spent like 15 minutes in that mansion just standing there and listen to Kirill's songs. That ""pet-pal""-Talent alone is worth a thumbs-up. It's so enjoyable talking to ""critters"" on a map. Getting hints, secrets or even quests. Or just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t nonsense :)   Pro-Hint (super tiny spoiler): Try to keep that cat alive at all costs you'll met very soon into the game ,-)  If you love RPG, like or can endure turn-based, there's no way around this one. GET IT. If you dislike RPG or turn-based: stay the heck away. This is not the droid you're looking for.   The good (what to love):  Play as one of the ""origin""-characters. With their own complete backstory. Which is highly recommended for your first playthrough. But you can still customize your character completly.  Graphics are really neat  SFX/Music is really great. Sadly no more new (obviously) tracks from Kirill. RIP man!  You can talk with animals. One of the coolest features ever in an RPG. Meet snobby cats, cynical crabs, hopelessly positive dogs, etc. Not only for fun, but also for quests, hints, secrets or for pure distracting amusement...Awesome feature!  MODS! The best thing a game could have. You don't like a particular feature? Get a mod. There is none? Make one. Every game should have that. PERIOD. This is and often was the distinct feature that seperated pretty good from AWESOME and long-lasting games.  Completely voiced, not one sentence is not spoken. I know, many people don't care, but it doesn't hurt either, does it? I personally like it for added immersion.  No bugs/crashed so far. After two complete playthroughs at the moment of this review. Not even a misaligned texture.  Often many ways to solve a problem. For example getting of the first island there are around 11 (right?) different ways to do that. Sure, most are pretty similar and end in more or less the same result, but as I often say: it's a game and not reality. Impossible to give you REAL freedom. It still feels like YOU chose the results.   Many actions DO have consequences. Some minor, some major.   Well done turn-based. From my noobish-PoV though. Fights are fun and can range from relaxing to OMFG-WHAT-HAVE-I-DONE.  Comparatively short loading-times. Once a map loaded, you instantly(!) switch areas (like to a cave or whatever else transition). VERY MUCH appreciated. Nothing kills immersion more than stupid 1-minute ""LOADING...""-screen. In and out of a cave in not a second. Yeah, great, thanks!  Tiny details like being able to make notes on the map. VERY helpful if you discover something that you MIGHT be able to solve/do/pickup/catch later.  You can specialize all of your companions upon you first meet them. Great detail! Like one of the characters but don't need their supposed role? Fine, change it. No problem.  End of Act 1, when you finally got a grip of things and how this crap works, you will get your option to RESPEC every character completely (including apprerance). YES! I love that. Some of us gamers don't want to put hundreds of hours into ONE game and multiple walkthroughs and be more efficient in JUST ONE walkthrough. Thanks for that. If you hate a feature like that, you don't HAVE to use it. The mediocre (not good, not bad, but no show-stopper either):  Some schools/talents/skills are somehow pointless and you will never use them. Good idea, bad execution  Some ambient chatter become VERY annoying VERY quickly when you're e.g. shopping near and micro-managing equipment. Damn stupid NPCs :-)  From time to time it doesn't really seem to matter much how you're playing (be the nice guy or the sociopathic arsewipe). Some or most encounters are bound to happen anyway either way. But well this is a game and not the real world, it's impossible to be prepared for everything :)  VERY high replayability (not a PRO for people with not much sparetime for gaming). Many ways to complete quests, enough people to form a party and hence change the quests/suprises/sidequests. This might be a big plus if you have much time at your hands.  If you hate micromanagement you might even be a lil frustrated at the lowest difficulty. You will have to manage gear, skills, talents and spells for four characters nearly every 5 meters when you've found a new thing. Lower difficulties are very forgiving though. But can still challenge you if you have zero idea of what's going on. But if everything's too much for you there are still MODS or even cheats.   No real Set-items. Well on the first Island there is a set. But not wearing the complete set curses you and by the time you'll have it complete it's of no use at all. And there isn't even a set-bonus. Reducing this to a boring errand for the completionist. The ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):  Items rarely really feel unique or great. Found a ""legendary""? Yeah well, walk 10meters and you'll find the next better one. Plus most non-""unique""-items are random which often results in horribly sucky items. Intelligence-requireing pants with +X strength. Strength-requirement-ring with +X Intelligence and some mage-stats. Yeah great. For selling. Boring. For example the first SET: Great to aquire. Requires lot of work/details. But you'll end up selling that stuff for some coins before even completing it to WEAR it. Meh, VERY unsatisfying.   SOMETIMES it can be hard to even spot your enemies in between turns due to all those status-effects on the screen. Could be worse, but could definately be better.  If you play on higher difficulties you might find some schools/classes/character-combinations pretty useless/unfair. That MIGHT kill it for you. But balancing a complex RPG like this perfectly is pretty much impossible to admit. No excuse? You're to judge...  Crafting sucks. No filtering, no sorting and you learn new recipes every few meters. But I failed to find the need to craft anything besides runes anyway. Recommended?  If you can wrap your head around turn-based and like RPGs? YESYESYESYESYES! Don't hesitate. Even if you don't much like top-down games. You'll quickly forget that (I usually prefer 1st-Person). This is one beautifully crafted gem, with love for details. I'd name it the Witcher-Series of turn-based-isometric-RPGs. And I'm a Witcher-Lover."

Johnny_Devo,150,86,4,"January 1, 2017",Recommended,236.1,"When I first got this game, I was immediately assaulted by an array of limiting areas, tough enemies, and hard fights, to the point where it felt like I wasn't allowed to do anything except a very strict railroad of easier enemies in order to progress. It made me start to lose faith in the game, because it seemed like there was only an illusion of freedom.  But then I got good. After floundering around in my first save file for a good few hours, I sat down and made a new character, applying everything I had learned. I made a focused character. I scrounged for every piece of armor, clawed at every possible avenue and advantage, and I applied the very tactics that destroyed me in the first playthough. It didn't take long to learn that if done right, the game is just as impossible for your enemies as it could be for you.  What I was rewarded with was knowing that there are, for example, several different ways to complete the first area. It's not a railroad; I just, to put it blunt, sucked. In fact, after discovering my first way though that beginning area... I went back in, and starting clearing out enemies, starting in order from most managable. It became an arms race of beating the lowest enemies I could find, surviving the encounter, and assimilating any loot I could find, up to and including the paintings on the walls.  Then, I come up to what I'll call ""midway"" through the first act. Suddenly things are falling into place with the plot, and I'm gaining hints of what appears to be a really neat story in the making. The varied things you can encounter kept my interest once I had the skill to progress, managing gear was interesting due to the magic armor and physical armor differences, and limited resources forced me to make interesting decisions every time I came across a nice piece of gear in a shop.  I began to learn of the various advantages and disadvantages inherent to different styles. Spreading your points can mean you have access to a ton of powerful toolbox abilities, but don't deal much damage. You can focus all your points into one aspect, and that character will be a high damage monster, but will lack in utility in comparison. Pair two such characters together, and your high damage will punch through the defenses of your victim, then the utility monster will knock them down for a turn, only to be put in the ground for good by your high damage character's second round.  Essentially, what I'm saying is if you find yourself overwhelmed by this game like I was at first, I suggest you attempt to absorb what the game is beating into you, then try to use that to beat it back into the game. If you can manage that, the varied builds and playstyles as well as the interactive battle system may just capture your attention.  Overall, this game is already something that I would consider great, and they're only in early access. They're still working on the game and the story, accepting feedback from the forums, and they're doing it well. Worth the full price now, can only get better from here. Would recommend."

DO NOT GET ME WRONG, the fights can be really, really unforgiving(ofc i play in classic), but rewarding as well.  10/10 i'd murder that child again."
jeep,161,48,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,75.4,"I am incredibly excited to say that this game is all that I could have asked of Larian Studios. As someone who loves Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, etc, Divinity: Original Sin 2 simply blows my mind. The dialogue can be witty, comedic, even tongue-in-cheek, but at times it is also grim, dark, and serious. Each character has their own way of coping with situations, and you as the player must work to keep the group together. You can choose the class of all of your adventurers, and tweak your main character at the start screen - in effect, you can multiclass from the get-go. Abilities synergize and can create opportunities that can be exploited by other party members - or, if you're not careful, by the enemy!   In terms of customization, the game is lovely. In summation, you can advance your character in a non-linear fashion if you so choose, but you might find it easier to create classes that are symbiotes (they benefit from each other's abilities).  In terms of audio, the game is FANTASTIC. The voice acting is wonderfully immersive, and the sound effects are well-timed and well-orchestrated. Speaking of orchestas, the soundtrack is incredible. If you don't believe me, give it a listen on YouTube. The ability to choose which instrument will play at turning points of the campaign really gives you that feeling of audio customization, and lets you feel like you are in control of every aspect of the game.  In short, I may sound like a ""yes-man"" when I wholeheartedly recommend this game. I may sound like there's nothing wrong with the game, but there are several bugs which are still unfixed and exploits that can be exposed to the savvy gamer. But, if you are like me, and you simply enjoy a game for what it has to offer (a complex storyline, diverse characters, entertaining combat, excellent audio, above-average graphics), then this game is for you!"

Yemeth,413,81,0,"December 15, 2017",Recommended,197.3,"You know those games that are just a few tweaks away of greatness? The original Original Sin was that kind of game.It had modernised CRPG mechanics,great combat,lots of choices on how to get on with the world,wonderful crafting yet cumbersome UI and a muddled story (even with the Enhancements later released)  Original Sin 2 tries to rectify all those mistakes. For my detailed review check this out:  http://indiannoob.in/divinity-original-sin-2-review-pc-noobreview-dungeons-dragons-and-mashed-potatoes/  +For starters, it has a more straightforward and darker storyline and writing. +The UI has been refined and is a lot more accessible +Character creation, customistaion, companions are all great. +General gameplay is still solid packing deep environmental interaction(in&out combat),fun crafting and exciting turn-based combat with good animations. +Classes are varied and many and balanced very well +Pretty much all lines are voice acted and they do a decent job.Same with the soundtrack +Challenging Tactician difficulty in which the game should be played (Normal being too easy) +Game Master mode for PnP RPG simulation and co-op is fun as always +Game looks great with a more grounded art style this time around +Mod Support   -I felt the streamlining of RPG attributes and skills from the first game is a bit of a let down (Although they allow less trial & error playthroughs) -The crafting seems to have been downplayed this time around.They have taken out the skills related to crafting and some fun recipes -Normal difficulty is way too easy,at least in the first chapter.  -Tactician mode felt cheap in some aspect like when it gives enemy ridiculous amount of physical and magical armor.In the first game,higher diffiiculty meant more enemies and smarter A.I.  TL:DR Orignal Sin 2 easily takes it's place as one of the greatest CRPGs ever along with Baldur's  Gate,Fallout,Wasteland,Planescape:Torment etc and at the same time possess mastery over it's technical aspects something the afforementioned games never did possess."
KRAUSER-SAMA,615,123,5,September 28,Recommended,74.7," The Short of it  Please note that everything that I write is based on my experiences with the Definitive Edition, and will also be looked at as standalone rather than compared to its predecessor.   Pros: +The world of Divinity OS 2 is vast and deep +The characters are fantastic, applies to NPCs but especially the Origin characters +An easy enough to understand combat system that possesses a great amount of depth +Absolutely stunning graphics +From the sound design to the soundtrack and especially the voice acting, it‚Äôs superb +The modding community is impressive to say the least with tons of ways to augment your experience  Cons: -...   More In-depth (Spoiler-Free)   +Story: Let‚Äôs start this off with one of DOS2‚Äôs greatest points, the story and world. While of course staying as spoiler free as possible, the game comes with an incredibly vast world for you to explore and venture through as you work towards your ultimate objective (which I‚Äôll be withholding for any prospective players interested in the game). From the main quest to the side quests, from your perspective as the protagonist to the NPCs in the game‚Äôs world, Larian has truly given thought to how they‚Äôd flesh out every area in terms of it‚Äôs lore. The greatest part of all of this is that, despite being a sequel, there's no disconnect for the player even if you having played the first. While I recommend playing both, I can assure any of you who were hesitant about diving straight into the second, it's completely alright to do so. This point on just how deep the world of DOS2 goes becomes apparent the moment you attempt to create a character and are revealed the Origin characters which I will be focusing on next.   +Origin: What is an origin character? Origin characters are a set of 6 very unique characters that already have their backgrounds integrated into the very core of the game. You can think of them as the closest thing to a preset character when thinking in terms of RPGs, but you needn‚Äôt fret, they are completely customizable on their stat spread and what class you wish to play as. I especially love these origin characters because they add an entirely new layer to what‚Äôs going on, you‚Äôre not only worrying about the current state of the world as the story tells it, but also your own circumstances. For example (very minor spoiler ahead), one of the origin characters is a red lizard with the title of ‚ÄúThe Red Prince‚Äù, born for glory yet fell from grace for ‚Äúcavorting with demons‚Äù, and on his own quest to reclaim his rightful throne. Given his position in the overall world of the game, he‚Äôs an important figure to say the least, as a result very early on in the game an assassin will make an attempt on your life. That is just a very small insight as to what DOS2 has to offer. These origin characters could each have their own stories told separately, but no, they intertwine into a much bigger tale. The amount of content you get from the narrative of this game alone is astonishing, and for that Larian Studios deserves a round of applause.  +Gameplay: Now, let‚Äôs get to the real meat of the game, shall we? How does the game play? In a word, spectacular. The game, as a CRPG, gets the job down without many issues. From traversing the various lands to engaging in combat, the game both looks and feels great. As a keyboard and mouse user at the very least I found the controls to be quite intuitive. Combat is fairly simple, you learn skills and associate those skills to your hotkey of preference, activating said skill will either require that you choose a target or a specified location (Area of Effect) which will be controlled by your mouse. Pretty simple, right? However, the battlefield is ever changing and the higher the difficulty, the more considerate you need to be of what exactly is happening and how you should react accordingly. There are many factors that can go into a fight than just slinging spells into the face of your enemy, environmentals and utility based effects can be the key to turning the tide in a battle. This may sound like rather obvious advice, but I can‚Äôt think of a CRPG that‚Äôs done it better than how Larian Studios has.  Like in D&D (where you will often hear the comparison made), the game really starts from the beginning of the game, the character creation (yeah, we‚Äôre back to good ol‚Äô character making) the distribution of your points from the beginning and how you proceed from thereafter is crucial, especially if you‚Äôre a player that wishes to challenge themselves with the highest difficulty. One particular stat in the game that I‚Äôd like to bring up in reference to this point is the ‚Äúmemory‚Äù stat. Memory is a stat that you upgrade when you wish to assign more skills to your hotbar. Learning the spell is one thing, but you can‚Äôt cast that which you haven‚Äôt ‚Äúmemorized‚Äù. As a summoner/caster hybrid of sorts I cannot tell you how much memory played a factor in how I progressed because there is such a wide variety of builds I wish to try. You can of course find a few mods to make this easier, but that‚Äôs completely player preference, I personally like the restriction otherwise I‚Äôd be a walking arsenal (which is fun in it‚Äôs own right hehe). The game is easy enough to understand but there are a number of factors that will make or break you in this game if you aren‚Äôt careful, be it in combat or otherwise.  +Graphics: Typically, a CRPG‚Äôs main concern isn‚Äôt how it looks, but DOS2 has been crafted with very special care in this regard. The environments are beautiful (in more than one sense depending on where you‚Äôre looking), the character models are fair and above all else magic possesses a special sort of impact I don‚Äôt see in other games of its genre. I‚Äôm particularly infatuated with the animations and poses performed when casting spells, the details on these animations alone are something to be in awe of.  +Sound: I must say, the sound design in this game is great given the variety of different types of skills there are to learn. In respect to the background music, in character creation, you can actually select an instrument of choice to play the soundtrack. This I found to be a very nice touch, as someone who likes his music. However, the aspect I‚Äôm truly stunned by is the voice acting. Just pure, high quality voice acting planted throughout the game for every NPC (including animals!). This is a standard I wish more games had already adopted, but we live in a world where many AAA titles still cheap out on giving certain lines any audible lines.  +Mods: The game provides a plethora of content on its own, but that‚Äôs not all the fun that‚Äôs to be had. Say hello to the world of mods if you‚Äôre playing DOS2. THe modding community for this game is incredible, there are many quality of life mods, class overhauls, or completely new classes altogether with specially made animations just for that class! Of course, that isn‚Äôt all there is to modding in this game, but I feel that those are the major ones to point out. Modding can truly enhance your experience, or extend the lifetime of this already eternal game by an unfathomable amount. If you feel bored playing a game once, even in a game with as much diversity as this, well mods will change that.    Conclusion  I could nag about the infinitesimally issues that rarely popped up here and there (like the particular position of the camera interfering with a particular action), but there‚Äôs just too much good content to talk about to even try. No matter what angle you try to look at this game from, it easily stands out from the rest and establishes itself at the top of its kind. A truly ‚Äúdivine‚Äù game.

Tuco,750,80,7,"November 25, 2017",Recommended,336.6,"Divinity: original Sin 2 is a strong contender to ""Game of the Year""  and with few meaningful tweaks it could easily compete to rank among the best RPGs of all time.  Like for its predecessor, its strong points are the massive amount of player agency permitted, one of the best turn-based combat systems in the business, a great degree of environmental interaction and very solid encounter design.  Disappointingly enough, this sequel fails mostly in the same area that hindered its predecessor: itemization and stat bloat. Larian's stubbornness with randomized loot over unique and hand-placed items means you'll never get rewards that are meaningful, just generic items that can drop anywhere or pop in any merchant's inventory at any given time. That kills a lot of incentives to bring down strong enemies, solve quests and explore for hidden treasures: when every action can potentially get the same outcome, it doesn't really feel like accomplishments matter that much.  On top of that, the problem with stat bloat emerges few hours into the game. While the problem presents itself from the beginning (by the time you'll get all the pieces of the first armor set in the starting area they'll be completely obsolete), it becomes genuinely grating past level 14-15, as you'll quickly get to the point where the jump in values at each level will be so ridiculous you'll literally double your HP/damage/armor values, etc. This essentially forces (well, strongly encourages) the players to replace ALL the equipment for his entire party at every level up.  That's not just annoying and a bit pace-breaking, but it also has the not irrelevant side effect to make you feel like no piece of equipment you'll find, no matter how strong at that given moment, gives you any long-term value.   There were surely better ways to handle these aspects, even just looking at the past. This game with the Baldur's Gate 2 itemization could have been a all-times classic."

Butcher Pete,231,37,7,"September 20, 2016",Recommended,159.7,"I played the first Divinity: Original Sin, and now I have played Divinity: Origin Sin 2 to completion (or to, at least, completion when it comes in terms of what is available in the alpha), and yet I am considering picking it up for a second run.  The combat of this game is excellent, and - I believe - is its shining feature.  And if you think you are particularly good at it there is now even a PvP arena in DOS 2.  With that said, if you did not like DOS 1, you will probably not like DOS 2.  The game is the same formula, practically the same combat system (with a few improvements and a few setbacks), and really the same story-quality of the first game.  You might find the story a little disappointing if you bought into all the hype that Larian threw down about hiring so many writers, when really what you are looking at is pages and pages of written dialogue (no voice acting) that you will probably begin to skip through six hours into the game.  And I say that as someone who loves books (Andrej Sapkowski's Blood of Elves is sitting right next to my keyboard).  But, look on the brightside: it's still early access right?  They could improve it... well, at least we can hope.  While I certainly have enjoyed DOS 2 for its combat, graphics, and character design... the story is not going to win any awards if it stays in its current form.  If that is going to be a deal breaker for you then I suggest you wait until the game is finished and see how it is then.  But if a badass combat system is enough to draw you in, then I'll see you in the arena!  (Oh, by the way, I should mention that the lizards in this game look really, REALLY badass... and sexy. :3)"

Choices mattered in those games.  If you ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up a quest, the game would make damn well sure you knew it ‚Äì and felt it.

"Sir Kirby, the Radio Pheasant",105,39,2,August 5,Recommended,187.2,"This game is as close to 10/10 as possible: There are plenty of encounters that play off each other, and impact that can be had from simple interactions you might not think much of. The amount of interplay from this game is absolutely amazing, and I'm almost certain you can have hundreds of hours and still miss some really small nuanced things in the game.  I came into this game never having played the first, and I still absolutely loved it. Single player is completely awesome, even if a bit more work, but if you have a group of friends to play this with? All the more awesome.  The following review is spoken without ever touching modding, or anything beyond the base campaign.  Some complaints that you should be on the lookout for: -Grasping the spell interactions can be a bit steep when starting out for mages. (For instance, you may poison your undead tank to heal them, and then hit them with a spell called Fortify which can remove your heal) -Sometimes, you can be roped into conversation with a character who isn't your pursuasion char, and then be forced to spill spaghetti and rope your team into a fight -Line of sight will 9 times out of 10 kill you, and you can only cry a single tear as the NPC sometimes snipes you through solid walls -Spell mileage will vary greatly from the player to the computer (a charmed/taunted npc may cheese out their turn, where you will seemingly always be forced to do something absolutely silly and try to kill yourself) -Whenever your characters are charmed/taunted, they *will* absolutely destroy your inventory full of consumables (though they will *always* use your rain scrolls first) -In later levels, with lots of particle effects and interactions, the computer may take quite a bit of time in deciding their turns -Sometimes, depending on how good your computer is, you can have a very unstable game -Some playstyles aren't quite viable. (For instance, a battle mage is ""possible"", but not really ideal, as you end up splitting damage over physical/magical resistance, which makes Crowd Control nigh impossible, as the real damage from physical/magical spells comes out when you are hitting their Hit Points directly) -Spirit vision (a thing that lets you talk with ghosts) is great from a lore perspective, but it can be easy to forget how versatile it is if you're not actively thinking about it; and if you're actively thinking about it, you pretty much have to spam it and walk across the world hoping you don't miss a fun little lore tid-bit. -Some fights are just straight up brutal if you don't quite know what's going on, all I can say is don't be afraid to google a bit of help if you're really struggling  Despite the complaints above, those really are just minor inconvinences which you'll have from time to time. Think of them like speedbumps in the middle of a really awesome racetrack. Like, you can't deny the rest of the racetrack how awesome it is, though you sometimes wish you could run it without the speedbumps. (Fingers crossed that some grievances will be removed in the Enhanced Edition) Pros: -After the initial learning curve, you basically get to sit back and relax and explore an amazingly intricate world of well written, well voiced, beautifully animated and beautifully built NPCs and the world they live in. -You get a lot of self-insertion capability, either playing the righteous hero, or scourge of the land.    And now for a fun story with minor spoilers:  So I'm playing Beast On the last legs of his life being beaten up unfairly by 3 condecending copies of Amadia, and 1 of Duna he's shackled he's maimed he's crippled he's floored he's on fire he's an inch from death our team long since abandoned him save for one lovely summoner Fane and his Incarnate ""Waga"" Champion in a true heroic moment tried to send a charge of battering ram to knock them all down but no one got to see what happened after the champion charged all 4 members of our divinty crashed as soon as the spell was cast 11/10, would get rekt again  "

You have the Pin system for the Zone Map but if we could do smaller temporary local Pings that would be super helpfull, or have the ability to draw fading lines on the minimap or on the ground.    Great game though!"

Narayan,698,32,4,February 8,Recommended,172.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a true modern cRPG. Instead of just emulating the Infinity Engine itself, it preserves the old school soul and complexity, includes all the things you would expect from ye olden days, adds many positive surprises on top of it, then frames them into amazing shiny 3D visuals with functional UI and tons of convenience. Even though there is number 2 in the title, it can be played as a standalone game without prior knowledge of the previous OS, or others in the Divinity series.  The game world is just packed with stuff to do - every few steps you bump into something new happening. And that‚Äôs above and below ground, as the game features quite a lot of caves, dungeons, ancient ruins, cellars, and even a pocket universe. The player has always plenty options to chose from how to proceed. Abilities like persuasion or lockpicking are really useful, and talking to animals is just awesome. The story is serious in tone, with many mature subplots, but it‚Äôs not lacking some needed moment to moment humor either (usually when doing side missions, not as unnecessary comic relief to main line). There are many memorable characters & situations. The companions are great and well fleshed out, each of them quite distinct. Their stories often intertwine with the main plot, so they all feel relevant.  While the game is fantasy in nature, and there are plenty of things we‚Äôre used to, there are also many quirks and ideas unique only to this world. Enough for it to feel fresh most of the time.  It‚Äôs not perfect though (but close). There are limits to what you can do, although there is very high chance you'll be able to execute most plans you come up with. The pacing was a little weird as well - the 2nd area with Driftwood was just too huge and not particularly structured. They might have been aiming at more open feel after the initial island, but it just turned out to be tiring by the end of it, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of there. I‚Äôm aware that if I wasn‚Äôt a person hell bent on scouring every inch of the map, and doing absolutely everything, I might feel otherwise, but that‚Äôs just the way I like to play, so that part didn‚Äôt mesh well with my game style. I had to take a break a bit after that, but later areas, Nameless Isle and Arx were great again :)   Part of that issue might have been due to combat, there was just too much of it for my taste. The combat at first is quite confusing, since many useful skills are too spread out between different lines, and it introduces some new concepts like surfaces. Then you get the hang of it, and it‚Äôs fun for some time, and later on you get overwhelmed by sheer amount if it. There are many epic fights all right, but at the same time, even though I appreciated the variety and scope of them, sometimes I just wanted to get it over with and progress a bit faster (turn based battles can take a while).  But overall D:OS2 is simply outstanding. Highly recommended :)  Written after 173 hours played & 84 of 97 (87%) achievements earned. "
Grant,376,69,3,September 3,Recommended,114.0,"I will try to keep this review short and sweet.  Generally speaking - I am not a fan of turn based games. I prefer real time RPG Combat found in games like Skryim, Fallout, and Witcher 3 (The GOAT).   With that being said, even with it not being my favorite combat method, this game is INCREDIBLE. The story and choice making you can make is very similar to Fallout : New Vegas, where each dialogue matters and has an impact.   In terms of replayability, you can choose across multiple ""Origin"" characters, who all have deep back stories and the ability for you to influence the future on a very large scheme.   If you like RPGs where you get to make choices, this ranks up in the top 3 for me, which are Fallout : New Vegas, Witcher 3, and Divinity : Original Sin 2.   If you've taken the time to read this entire review, take the plunge and invest the time in this game, because it is insanely good."
Separomaturi,219,56,3,"December 26, 2016",Recommended,78.4,"After spending hundreds of hours playing D:OS, I can confidently say that D:OS 2 improves nearly every aspect of the original's gameplay.  Without spoiling any of the story so far, I can at least comment on the richness of the added mechanics, and the undeniable feel of polish added to the user interface, character creation, and combat.  The co-op works great for 2, 3 or even 4 players, my friends and I were able to jump straight-in without any issues.  Highly recommend."

Sarlic,336,43,0,"September 18, 2016",Recommended,152.5,"EDIT:  Below this edit is the original review I made during Early Access. Currently I would have to say 100% of my issues with the game in the early access were addressed even before the release. The AI has been improved to the point they make choices a skilled player may make. The Mass AP issue has been entirely resolved. The issue with certain skills not being balanced as in Hailstorm, Single Dagger and others have all been rebalanced and made entirely fair.   To add to this they have outdone themselves by adding FULL voice acting in the game, something that was only in the first one after the enhanced edition. The mechanics for the undead are entirely fleshed out. The storyline is entirely fluid and fleshed out. I can honestly say this game has not only met but exceeded my every expectation is entirely justified in its price for the quality put into it. Larion Studios has released a game that shows what EARLY ACCESS should be used for and it's benefits. I whole heartedly look forward to their next game.  EARLY ACCESS ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'll start by saying that I am well aware it's early access so some features are clearly not available as of yet.  The game is indeed an improvement overall to the first game, the combat is more fluid and challenging however I do see an issue in the fact the AI seemingly has collosal amounts of AP and can walk halfway across the field and still attack. This was an issue in the first game as well though and not a fault in D:OS2.  Even the very first goal of chapter one can be suceeded in so many ways including simple brute force if you happen to be a tactical genius. The added Highground vs Lowground bonus/penalty for ranged attacks in a great addition as it adds other dimension to the tactics in combat.   My greatest complaint is really just a matter of not being able to test out the true customization of the character classes. I also admit that the first town in D:OS seemed to have so much more to do but I do enjoy the more serious and adult approach of D:OS2.  All in all I genuinely believe the game is worth picking up, not necessarily saying people should buy it now at full price but it will definitely be a game worth playing with your friends. Albeit a very unforgiving game."
Sgt. Steak,122,79,5,June 11,Recommended,147.7,"ForenoteI apologize if this review doesn't appear as crisp as others on this page, as I don't write them often. That said, I feel this is one that absolutely warrants doing so. I'll attempt to spare you copious amounts of gushing in favor of clearer, more concise points as I go, though you should be aware that I've always had a weakness for games like this. Your mileage, as it will in all things, may vary.   Positives Craftsmanship: Excellent! Clear attention to detail and passion funneled into worldbuilding. There is a lot to see, hear and learn in Rivellon, and you'd be amazed at where and from whom this knowledge comes from.   Character depth: Glaringly flawed in some areas, but otherwise great! Whether pre-built avatars or enlisted as companions in the game itself, the game's cast of characters is unique and brimming with their own motives, thoughts and ideas. Likewise, those you do take with you aren't just along for the ride, and will actively attempt to make an impact on your adventure.  Nuance and Build Variety: Excellent! Anything is possible (within some very loose limitations) provided you're willing to work to put it together.  Gameplay: Good! Turn-based strategy type combat similar in nature to XCOM, with some departures in the form of such things as character-specific initiative. Larian's systems have a few issues, though, and a fair number of them can be really, really frustrating to deal with.  Story: Great! Not the most amazing story I've experienced, but definitely worth the time. It doesn't pull punches, and if nothing else, it is profoundly immersive.  Graphics: Excellent! Far above and beyond what is often expected of this genre, and despite the abundance of particle effects and bodies on screen, it runs smoothly to boot.  Soundtrack: Fair! Nothing to write home about, sadly. It can absolutely set up a mood, but it never struck me as anything I'd carry with me beyond the game itself. Negatives Equality of Companion Storytelling: Not every character was written equal, and it shows. Some have little to no impact on the story overall, while others quite literally change the perspective of everything going on. Taking those that land in the former category invariably trades interesting character dialogue, interations and bonding for what has the potential to be some of the more interesting tid-bits about the lore, important figures and what-not.  Gameplay: Inconsistent autosave mechanic makes it easy to lose hours of progress if you're not particular about saving over and over again. Items acquired during that lost time are not guaranteed to exist upon a reload, nor will they have the same stats as the game rerolls everything you do not presently own each time you reload. Initiative can be annoying and it creates opportunities for more powerful enemies to murder a member or members of your party before you can even act, if you aren't careful.  'Endgame': I feel no shame in admitting Divinity's stronger moments are in its first half, where you're getting to know the world and the people you're traveling with. A lot of crazy, fantastical things happen, but it all serves to further motivate you to seek out the real and honest truth. Sadly, however, a lot of the payoff isn't quite as stellar as I was hoping it'd be. In an effort to keep from spoiling anything, I'll clip this bullet with: Some of the final decisions can feel a little forced, and as resolutions approach, it becomes painfully obvious that, as above, not all companions and characters were written equal. Overall Divinity, in spite of what are ostensibly minor flaws (with the exception of some of the story-related notes), is a game that I wholeheartedly reccomend if you're a fan of the top-down dungeon crawler/RPG style of game. It has a lot of heart, and the world is very well put together. While there are some inconsistencies, some painfully overt 'nyah nyah' moments with the game's villains, and a general undertone of slight predictability to its story, it pulled me in and got me hooked on all the little details it had to offer. My only major gripe from a roleplaying standpoint is how... well, for lack of a better word, weak some of the resolutions are. At best, it can feel a little forced and at worst, some of the endings to several of the arcs in my playthroughs struck me as outright betrayals of everything that had been built up. In an effort to avoid spoilers (beyond what little I already have), this is something best experienced and decided in person.   As for gameplay, Divinity offers a rather open-ended system that can be tweaked and paired in a vast number of ways. It helps keep combat engaging, and it offers a great deal of replayability, as there are always new ways to try tackling different situations. That said, it has some very serious flaws that I found somewhat stifling, not the least of which being encounters with tougher enemies with a party that wasn't solidly invested in high initiative scores. Others, such as strange inconsistencies with line of sight, action points and other integral mechanics were certainly noticeable, but hardly game-breaking. Not much of a change from the first game there, I'm afraid.  In all, I'd rate this a 4/5. I would have been comfortable paying more than its asking price for the experience I got."

Dank Knight,397,89,5,February 2,Recommended,184.4,"NOTE:This is my experience after 45 hours into the game on Tactician difficulty, mostly solo. So the review is subject to changes.  PROS: (Oh boi, where do I begin from) +Looks very good visually and boasts equally good music. +Deep character customisation and progression. +Complex, intricate systems that let you experiment and even break the game. This lends to a lot of player freedom and agency. +Staggering attention to detail. +Quests are plenty and missable. There are multiple approaches and outcomes to every quest. +Chaotic, tactical combat along with clever AI scripting +The amount of replayability is off the charts! This is one game which requires multiple runs to experience everything.  CONS:-Some UI issues, where I had to click on a combat skill multiple times for the game to register it. A minor nitpick.  VERDICT:Simply put, Divinity Original Sin 2 IS the best role-playing game that makes The Witcher 3 look like a generic open-world title. What you get is an impossibly interactive game world where every action seems possible, and has consequences with such a level of complexity and flexibility it‚Äôs difficult to believe it exists, let alone that it could ever be bettered.  Its scope can be intimidating, but not overwhelming, and there‚Äôs usually a way to fix a mistake.  And it‚Äôs that intimidating, ambitious scope, that dedication to player freedom, that makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so impressive.  There isn‚Äôt another game right now that lets you do so much.   This is an easy 10/10. Buy it, play it and fall in love with RPG's all over again."

Darxim,122,34,2,"November 16, 2016",Recommended,498.8,"[Updating review from Early Access]  Almost all of the negative reviews of this game remark that they gave negative review for one of two reasons: 1. Game has too many bugs. 2. Game is too difficult.  That first one is fair.  There are a lot of bugs.  I'm currently not actively playing it due to this.  With this game's ambitious scope, bugs are expected.  Although, relative to a Bethesda game, this game was practically bug-free at release.  The second point, however, is just stupid.  tl;dr: It's not.  When you start the game, you choose your difficulty.  If Tactician is too hard for you, play Classic.  If Classic is too hard for you, play Explorer.  If Explorer is too hard for you, I'm surprised you're able to operate a computer at all.  I started one game on Explorer just to find something out that I couldn't where I was in my game (it was crafting related), and I was killing most things in one hit.  How is this difficult for you?  Honestly, I think it's just people playing on Tactitican because they think they're awesome, then get their asses handed to them because they're not.  I've seen people claim that Act 1 is impossible on Tactician.  Keep in mind that people had already beaten the entire game on Tactician when these claims were made.  If you want an easy game, I would say that this game is not for you, but Explorer mode is available, and it is a really good game, so you should probably still play it.  Another complaint I've seen, although it's rare, is about the level bloat.  I agree with this complaint.  There is way too big a difference between one level and the next, and the steepness of the curve makes it a lot worse.  The game would be a lot better without it.  I can understand the power increase from leveling being on a curve, as that's normal, but the curve is too damn high."

Harkening back to the golden era of Fallout, Planescape: Torment, Baldur's Gate and the likes, it fully deserves to stand alongside those greats.   It's hard to explain how enjoyable the game is. It refines and improves almost everything from the original Divinity: Original Sin. The attention to detail, environments, quests, voice acting, combat, etc are all fantastic. The addition of multiplayer is absurdly fun and just the sheer variety the game offers is something else entirely. It's such a smooth RPG experience but so polished, and still retains the things that made old school CRPGs so great. Everything comes together to make this atmospheric experience, from the music to the writing and to the mechanics themselves.

Initially the lack of voice acting was my only bane and still kind of is, but I can understand why with the amount of writers in this game as opposed to the first. Only 2 writers for Divinity Original Sin, there's triple that for this and voicing the game would take years. Conversations feel a lot more in depth too and I found myself voluntarily reading it as opposed to just skipping, which is what I ended up doing on Original Sin (not that it was boring, I loved the voice acting, just got very tedious in my opinion). Worth the money tbh, I am very proud to know that I am supporting Larian Studios on this journey. If you haven't got DOS2 and have been thinking about it for a while, it's worth it."
federated state of trollnesia,158,80,5,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,51.7,"Some pretty severe balancing problems really hurt this game on the harder difficulties at the moment I write this review. It definitely seems like melee-heavy parties are not very viable. I've restarted three times now and reduced my party's melee investment with each restart and I've been progressively enjoying the combat more as a result. Basically, melee at least so far in the first act, do not have mobility skills they need to do anything. Attacks of opportunity require a trait investment, which is kind of lame. It doesn't help armored enemies mitigate a lot of melee damage and that getting magic resistance as a fighter is difficult, resulting in a lot of annoying CC from numerous enemies.  I've had to cheese a lot of my fights to win them (abusing conversation mechanics mostly) and it feels kind of bad.  The game is still fun, but I would advise doing research about party composition before investing a lot of XP.  Also, this game commits a lot of ""cardinal sins"" for me: 1. Persuading people down from fights...results in a net XP loss and no notable change in the story's outcome (at least so far); as far as I can tell, being a murderous bastard is the best way to play this (by far, even). Aside from meager barter prices I don't see a point in making a charismatic character. 2. You're encouarged to fight and kill trash for XP; at multiple parts in the first act instead of advancing the story like I wanted to, I was compelled to scour the area for more things to kill. If you like this, then this is the game for you. Reminds me a lot of Baldur's Gate in that regard. 3. Some party members, if you don't keep them on a short leash, will break quests for you by doing naughty things to NPCs. 4. Quests break...and there's no notification about it. It's basically a missing thread. It's kind of interesting this way, leaving you to figure out how to resolve the quest, but if there's no way to resolve it, you'll never know for sure. So be careful when you go murdering people who might be connected with a quest. This is definitely preferable over Skyrim's ""everyone is invulnerable"" bullcrap, but I'd like to know when I've royally ruined everything and should reload. 5. A lot of game mechanics aren't forshadowed at all (one of the early fights has turtles which...explode for a ton of damage when you kill them, really great surprise when you have a lot of melee in your party) and you'll be reloading after you experience them. 6. Numerous boss weapon drops so far for me have been inferior to standard stuff I find in shops. It's funny (not in a way I like), this one notable enemy I killed dropped a dagger which had a ""10% bleed chance"" mod on it - and that was supposed to be the draw for me using it I guess? In a turn based strategy game, ""10% anything"" might as well as not be there. There are a lot of other lukewarm mods on gear that might as well not be there or do anything. I've been vendoring a lot of stuff. 7. Gold isn't super abundant, so you will be picking up pots, pans, and kitchen sinks to make by. I've never liked this as it's just absolutely silly and tedious.   Depsite my gripes, this is definitely a solid RPG and tactics game, at least the most of what we can expect from 2017."

Prime,180,26,0,"October 20, 2017",Recommended,119.1,"This game made me excited to play games again. I love it, 10/10. Okay, maybe not. Assigning a number score is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing useless anyway. I will just be critical of this game and probably talk more about the things I dislike as opposed to the things I do, everyone has already gushed enough about this game. I think it is one the best RPGs of this generation, but it's not perfect.  Extremely open ended, with lots of possible ways to approach a given objective (encounter/quest etc.) which opens up a lot of possible playstyles/roleplay choices. This however, does introduce a lot of broken sh*t, the quest log being one glaring example and I have broken a few enounters by doing X when I should have done Y first  for some arcane reason .  Characters are well written, although all the fantasy cliches are there, they are subversive to those tropes in places and each main character has a nicely rounded theme/character arc. Writing in general is nuanced and mature, serious in tone but not lacking in humour a la classic Larian. Main Quest has some interesting ideas and dynamics, but kinda falls apart by the end of act 3 imo  (Act 3 feels very endgame, only for the main villian to pull out a dues ex machina 'lolz gotcha!', only played up to the begining of act 4, so who knows, might redeem itself in the end)    Combat is a little different from Original Sin 1 because of the inclusion of the Armour system. It prevents turn 1 CC deciding battles, and I think it makes you think a bit more tactically during the initial turns but overall I think the system needs some improvements as your mindset going into each battle remains mainly the same, and it also makes some builds pretty trash (tanks, phys/ele hybrids etc). I like saving throws in D&D, a hybrid system where, for example, armour values influenced saving throws would work better imo.  I am not a fan of the character development, way too much number creep (going to the next levels means each piece of gear is instantly outclassed), gear isn't really that intersting, just get some +stats and maybe a free non-unique skill. Vitality/armour/damage scale way too high and picking stats comes down picking whatever gives you the damage multipliers for your skills. Not really engaging or meaningful. Thankfully these points can be easily solved by using mods, but mods don't influence my opinion on the design philosophy of the base game.  Tactician mode is kinda busted, maybe I need to git gud, maybe my fun Nice BuildsTM do not abuse mechanics enough. Classic mode gets too easy, too quickly. Woe is me.

rick.activemd,166,51,2,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,174.3,"So I feel I have enough information to give a well-informed review now that I'm 36.2 hours in. I've been reading, however, that if you haven't left the island yet, you are still in the tutorial! Immediate kudos for a content-packed game.  Having played the original Divinity tile from 2002, I've seen this game develop from a Diablo-esque point-and-click action RPG to the turn-based strategy game that is now Divine Divinity: Original Sin 2. Although I've missed a game or two since then, I wasn't quite sure what the storyline was, but the game clearly helps you understand what's been going on in the world of Rivellon right from the start. The immediate immersion into the game has the amazing quality to have me asking questions and wanting to seek out the answers to those questions. I was compelled to keep playing as I see the story unfold and each decision leads to more tangled pieces of the web of mystery that I need to solve.  The combat was easy to figure out immediately and I have to give Larian Studios another amazing pat on the back for integrating Full Controller Support for a turn-based isometric RPG. One of my big turn-offs is that, although I've played for keyboard and mouse combo for many years, I like my gamepad much better and will not buy any titles that don't support it.  There's some dispute about the Tactician mode and whether or not it's too hard. Having played 8 hours in Tactician mode, I finally discovered that if I wanted to enjoy the game and be able to progress in it, that I would have to play in Classic mode. Even in Classic Mode, the fights are still difficult and I've had to play a few of those, get killed multiple times, go level up my characters and improve my gear, and then finally win. Sometimes winning just barely with half my party killed.  The character creation was a little strange from most RPGs I've played, since you aren't really locked into a particular class and you can be whatever you want, based on the allocation of your Talents and Skills. I chose to play as origin character Ifan ben-Mezd, since I wanted to find out more about the storyline and how people fit into it. The build-selection during character creation made it easy to figure out what Skills and Talents were appropriate for the style of play you wanted for your main character. I always choose a good combination of melee and magic, so Battlemage was perfect for me.  Character dialogues have an added flair to them that give you extra choices based on certain tags you have or aquire or choices specific to certain origin characters.  The voiceovers are amazing and abundant, even down to having your own personal narrator. Many RPGs don't put that level of artisitic detail into their games when it comes to audio choices.  The environment is beautifully rendered and I enjoy it in full 4K resolution on my 65in. television. Full camera control with zoom in and out makes the environment easy to navigate.  Overall notes about Divinity: Original Sin 2:  * Content-packed (packed like it could rival the amount of content in Skyrim) * Mysterious and interesting storyline that makes you want to keep playing * Combat system is easy to figure out, but beware of Tactician Mode (was too hard for me) * Full Gamepad Support in a turn-based RPG (a rare find...I would play Tyranny if it had  Gamepad support) * Detailed voiceovers and soothing soundtrack * Great-looking environment that scales well to 4K resolutions  I hope this review helps someone!"

Tamaster,561,40,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,234.5," Review - Divinity: Original Sin 2  ===   RATING: 9.5 / 10 Legendary. There is no other word for it.   Overview Divinity Original Sin 2 (from now DOS2) is the second installment of the Original Sin saga, developed by Larian Studios first time a couple years ago. Veteran RPG makers as they are, they come a long way since they made the first Divine Divinity back in the early 2000's, and also the following chapters which all were good games (No, Beyond Divinity never existed, shhh). DOS2 is a real time RPG with turn based combat, with some new twists in the classic mechanics to keep it modern.  ===   Gameplay Analysis   General Gameplay  There is so much to say about the gameplay of DOS2, there really is. First of all, the thing that astonished me the most among all the good ones, which are really a lot, is the incredible freedom given to the player in all his actions and interactions with NPCs and eventual co-op players alike. The freedom DOS2 offers is as close as it can get to pen-and-paper RPG level of freedom transported in a videogame: every NPC is killable, everything can be stolen, companions will react on what you do based on their alignement and may even become your enemies (and so can do players you fplay with in multiplayer!), there are a myriad of different dialogue options suitable for any alignment you might want to role-play about, unique dialogues for each of the story NPCs, unique race-based ones, unique background-based ones, reputation based ones... so i mean, there are so many unique combinations and things that can happen that every play-through will be very different as far as interactions go, it's all about what you do and who you are, in this Larian did a wonderful job and very few other RPGs ever have been at the same level of depth in interactions.  Other than this, gameplay is pretty much straightforward and like any other classic RPG: explore a very vast world composed of 3 huge areas, plus all the dungeons and secret places of course, loot from randomly generated pieces of gear (except unique ones, those are always the same), fight a good variety of enemies each with its own features, and mind you enemies are very different from one another in this game so you will have to use new strategies a lot, solve quests in various ways depending on your alignment of just on how you feel like doing, but remember everything has some consequences.  If i was to explain in detail all the gameplay, this would be a very very long review and would go over the Steam word limit, so i tell you this: there have maybe been 2-3 RPGs in the whole history that match the depth this one offers, don't miss it.    Combat System  Combat in DOS2 is turn based and very much classic style. Every character starts with a fixed AP number each turn (excluding buffs and debuffs of course) and they are used for both movement and actions. There is no Mana in Divinity OS2, just cooldowns for all skills, and for some, a special type of energy is required.  The new mechanics Larian decided to introduce in OS2 are mainly about how armor works: in DOS2 there are two types of armor, Magical and Physical, which act like additional health bars and nullify any debuff or damage from that specific source (magical armor counters magical damage and magical debuffs, and so on) as long as it has 1 point at least. Once an Armor is depleted it can be regenerated with some skills and potions, but while down, Debuffs and negative statuses will always afflict the targeted character, there is no such thing as success percentage, it just matters if you have still Armor or not. The elimination of RNG this way is a quite clever gameplay change, but also comes with some issues we will discuss further on.  Other than that, rest assured, there are plenty of skills and fighting schools for all tastes, from warriors to healers to summoners, there are something like 150+ skills around to build your very custom characters the way you want.    Content  Immense. There is no way you can do everything in one play-through, you will have (and want to) play this game multiple times to get all the interactions, quests, and so on. To make just one play it can very well require above 85 hours, to complete the game 100%, can require more than 200.     Balancing  There just is one but quite serious issue with balancing: based on how the Armor mechanic is structured, it is logical to think that a party basing all its damage on either Physical or Magical would defeat enemies much quicker than splitting damage between example, 2 magical and 2 physical characters. And it is exactly how it is: a party based on just 1 type of damage is much more efficient, maybe too much, in combat and can defeat most enemies with much more ease than a ""standard"" party with some magical and some physical damage.    Challenge  Tactician difficulty, the hardest, is a serious challenge if taken without the proper respect. Badly built parties will be wiped with ease and requires planning, strategy in combat and experience. Some fights really impressed and got me on the brink of madness, let me tell you, and i play RPGs since twenty years! Luckily the unlimited and free re-spec at your base and adjustable difficulty will make the game beatable even for the less experienced.  ===   Technical Analysis   Graphics  Environments and art of cutscenes are really well done. Bear in mind this game does not make graphics one of its priorities, still the visuals are quite stunning in certain environments, particle effects are well done, character models are alright, armor and weapon models are made with particular care.  The world on DOS2 is vibrant and alive, the ccharacterization of the various environments and locations is marked very distinctively, it all contributes to the immersion feeling you already get from the roleplaying part.    Sound  It is to mention that Larian decided to voice act EVERY SINGLE DIALOGUE of this game, and there are a monstrous quantity. The voice acting is also good. This alone is a huge plus. other than this, the music and sound effects are at very good standards for an RPG, no really, they are good.    Performance  Performance is alright, the game is optimized well enough but can become heavy for low to mid end machines because it renders and makes all the characters in a whole area work together at the same time so it requires some computing power some machines might not have to run everything smooth.  Also when saving the game has some inexplicably huge frame drops.    Stability  DOS2 is not really unstable, it crashes sometimes, it is bound to happen, but rarely. There are no particular stability problems.    AI  Enemy AI is one of the best i've ever seen around. They will execute complex maneuvers to get the most efficiency out of just about everything. Think of this: enemies will get shoulder attacked to walls to avoid being back-stabbed if they are supports or ranged units and there is a rogue in the enemy team. How often you see this? Never. This is the level of AI i'm talking about, the same AI that curses you with healing is damage to bypass your shield and kill you with your own healing the next turn.  Prepare to be impressed.    Quality of Life  Inventory management and interfaces are generally good, but one thing is really bad: picked up new items will constantly clutter your hotbar and having to always clean it is a chore... there is a mod that solves this (blessed modding!) but as far as the vanilla game goes this is an issue.    Bugs / Issues  Sometimes enemies will just get stuck in combat if the pathfinding becomes too complex or if they are teleported / thrown / whatever in locations they cannot walk down from. In Act 3 some voice lines and dialogues are broken and do not work properly."

Shit Stain,441,19,0,"January 25, 2017",Recommended,83.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 improves on almost everything gameplay wise from the first game.  No longer do you have to deal with unfair elemental damage and debuffs that one-shot you, instead there's a new armour system that blocks this kind of damage more reliably, both physical and magical. This new system makes it so you manipulate the battlefield to your advantage more so than just spamming out CC spells on the enemies.  Combat is a lot smoother as they are both extremely aggressive but at the same time tactical as you aim your attacks. With the new armour system you will rely more on throwables and the environment to lower the opponents armour so that you can start controlling them with stuns or burning them.  A new addition are dialogue checks which are similar to the checks present in old isometric Fallout games where your statistics determine your ability to have a successful persuasion chance. Be careful who you use to talk to certain NPCs as now the checks are decided by your main stats and not only your persuasion stat.  Now the game is out of early access I really have to commend Larian for creating a fantastic game. They changed a few of the early fights so that they aren't too broken but at the same time switching it up enough to still make it challengeing. The new additions of polymorph skills and generous placement of source as well as tons of crafting recipes really shows Larian's commitment to making an amazing game.  Never before have I marveled at the magnificence and brilliance of an RPG as much as Divinity: Original Sin 2.  The freedom, progression, story and overall game mechanics makes this one of the best games I've ever played."

That's how much I looked forward to the game and I have to say, its the best purchase ever.   I usually wait for a discount before buying the game but this one is without a doubt WORTH the price tag. This game may seem overwhelming at first but that's what makes it sooo much fun in my opinion. Its what brings replayablitiy to the game. The glorious and satisfying combat just makes you want to keep coming back for more. There's nothing like freezing a puddle and then have Ifan trip over it. GODWOKEN DAMNIT IFAN!

DirtyBrownTaco,474,28,2,March 13,Recommended,71.0," Divinity: Original Sin 2 has been an utter delight from start to finish.  I use no hyperbole when I say this is the best RPG I've played thus far.   Pros   Fantastic score. Whether it be running around Fort Joy, taking in the sights on the Lady Vengeance, or amid an intense battle, the music sticks with you all the way through. I've been listening to some tracks repeatedly since first hearing them.   One of the deepest RPGs in terms of choice. A task such as escaping an island ends up having a plethora of options for you to achieve your goal. Want to sneak through a secret dungeon guarded by fire slugs? Sure why not. Want to get out simply by taking a boat? Go for it! Oh what's that? You want to cheat the system and simply teleport yourself and party into various edges until you manage your way out? You got it!   Wonderfully engaging story; filled with plenty of characters that are hard to forget. Don't forget the pet pal perk to talk to all of those animals around you! (Beware, you will be sad a lot of times talking to them.) Off put by the concept of reading a ton of dialogue? (Why are you buying this...) then worry not! Every single character (and animal) is fully voiced with some amazing VO work. However, the story did let me down in a few small ways, but I'll get to that soon.   Mods mods mods! The community has been excellent at coming up with some very inventive and fun mods to use throughout your adventure. Anything from new classes, new spells, revamping certain systems, and if you're a glutton for punishment - mods that make the game even harder. Cons  Remember how I mentioned how amazing the story was? Yeah, well that‚Äôs for the majority! As some others have mentioned, going into the final act and ending, there are some definite inconsistencies with the quality of writing and apparently attention to lore. (I've never played any other Divinity games;  I was unaware until doing further research.) For a game that boasts such a wide range of choices and how they really matter; the ending(s) seemed largely basic and almost unrelated to your adventures throughout the game.   Technical problems. Any game of this size will be bound to suffer from some technical issues, I completely get that. Overall, it was nothing major - apart from one game breaking bug I encountered causing some invisible enemies to 1 hit KO me, but luckily, I had a save from not long before that I managed to get back to and the problem seemed to have fixed itself. While the bugs weren't outright angering - in the final act I did find myself getting increasingly peeved by the buildup of several small bugs affecting my experience. At times enemies will take AGES to take their turn - leaving you to simply sit there and watch them and their idle animation until they finally realize they should be doing something.    Tech probs cont. The camera and reticule would at times completely spaz out and throw itself in a random direction and would continue to do so whenever trying to target certain areas or enemies. This may have been due to some mods interfering with the code, but at times my journal would be completely wiped of all data - leaving me to have to remember what quests I still needed to do.   Balance issues. Exploring the various locales sometimes leads you into areas where you are WOEFULLY unprepared or situations that unless you had prior knowledge, are borderline impossible to defeat. While it didn't bug me too much, I frequently encountered some dialogue/enemies that upon entering the fight would instant kill my party, use the same skill numerous times with seemingly no cooldown like the heroes, or somehow know exactly the best way to take out a party member. (Did I mention I was playing on explorer? The 'easiest' mode of them all) In the end though, I loved this game and every single minute I put into it. Some problems did irk me enough to slightly lower my score, but ultimately, I'm marking this game down as one of my favorite RPGs of all-time.  9.5/10"
Ethrin,894,51,3,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,68.6,"I'm still working my way through the introduction of the game (haven't gotten past the first city), but so far I'm loving it! I'm playing on the Classic difficulty, and there are two difficulties higher than this one.  My characters are now level 7, but this is still an early review, as I have yet to complete act 1.  Pros: 1.) Combat is incredibly tactical. There have been a couple of fights where I got my butt handed to me because I didn't think to exploit the terrain or the destructibles placed in the battlefield.  Height matters a lot more in this game, especially if you have a huntsman. 2.) Oddly, the soundscape is amazing.  Walking through town you can hear the bustling of people walking around. It sounds great when you're in a dungeon, along the beach, and everywhere.   3.) Voiceovers, world building, and characters has been spot on so far.  I have found some characters to be really funny, and others to be incredibly intriguing, such as Losche. 4.) The game doesn't prevent you from doing things out of order.  Once you escape from Fort Joy, it really opens up and allows you to wander around the map in any direction.   Cons: 1.) Don't get me wrong, the UI is pretty well done in this game.  However, there are some UI'isms that I would like improved.  Such as being able to send all of my ""wares"" to one character (who has the highest bartering skill).   2.) Saved game bloat bug.  Right now there is an issue with saved games getting extremely bloated to the point where it can take a long time for my computer to upload the saved games to the cloud.    Closing Thoughts: This is definitely a CRPG that has had a lot of love and time put into it.  It will ask a lot of you (time wise) to get going, but so far, it has been a really enjoyable ride!  I definitely recommend it so far, and I will update as I get further into the game.  EDIT: Updated with some more pros and cons.

And not just the illusion of choices, every situation you encounter has so many ways to get through that it's not too improbable to say you could most likely replay this game for thousands of hours and never get bored.  This game is more or less dungeons & dragons in a game engine, while you could say other games are like dungeons & dragons this game practically IS dungeons & dragons, aside from the fact that unless you're playing game master mode you can't make things like persuasion checks in the midst of combat/etc.  It would be an injustice to call this game anything but a masterpiece, it easily sits on top of the rpg world, rivaling all including possibly my #1 rpg of all time Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup[crawl.develz.org].

Halwin,838,156,5,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,190.5,"C'mon, become Overwhelmingly Positive already! While at the time of writing this review, I haven't even gotten past the first Act yet, I nevertheless feel compelled to write a review for this beautiful game. For me the game's highlight is its excellently designed turn-based combat. There are no potentially pesky RNG elements and therefore every fight follows the same strict rules allowing you to have full control over how every battle plays out. There's also an insane amount of skills that are open to each and every character, and free to combine at your leisure (half of the fun is simply experimenting!). While the game is very very challenging (in a good and fair way!), I never felt the need to look up guides as with some thought you are more than able to compose your own diverse team of heroes (except maybe on hard difficulty - but don't play that until you finished Classic!). The voice acting is also superb, with tons and tons of spoken dialogue and different choices you can make. Also initiating a dialogue with another of your team members may open up a whole different story which may reveal more of the character you are interacting with or the world around you. Finally, the graphics look more than impressive enough considering the game's genre, and the level design has nothing to complain about.  Admittedly, no game is without its flaws though and I will summarise my, minor, grievances here. Inventory management is still a hassle. It's a common issue for RPGs, and I'm not sure if there ever will be a game that's perfect in that regard, but with four party members, switching items to and fro, out and in of backpacks and the like, becomes a considerable hassle. Especially when it can be hard to discern between quest items, crafting materials, fluff, and junk. To add to that, civic skills like bartering and lucky charm (increases your chance to find rare items with that player only) are not group-wide, meaning that you will have to switch items (and gold) to and fro your characters yet again to reap the maximum gold and good gear. Frankly, I don't bother with the last two because it's a serious nuisance, and it doesn't really make the game too hard without. Nevertheless a fix to this inconvenience would be appreciated. Furthermore, certain skills are either useless - initiative: determines the play order during a fight for your team only, meaning that having one at 13, then 12, 11, 10 is sufficient and any extra points are basically lost, - or certain skills provide odd bonuses - warfare: a melee oriented skill that apparantly is the best damage increase for rangers as well (I do have a ranger in my team with 5 huntsman and 0 warfare however, and he's perfectly viable on Classic. I only need to make sure he's positioned with a height advantage, which is actually how the game intended rangers to be played). Last, but not least, there's no way to change party members during a conversation, meaning that if you are forced into a dialogue (probably because he/she was closest to the conversation starter) with someone and a persuasion check needs to be passed, it is impossible to have your player with skill in pursuasion take it over (this led to frequent quickloads for me). Basically during dialogue your team members turn into mutes unless they are scripted to take part in the conversation.   I didn't intend for the second paragraph to be longer than the first, and I would recommend to pay more focus to the great things this game offers rather than the minor nuisances. I will give this game a higher rating once some (or all) of these issues are addressed, which I actually expect they will.   TL;DR: A must buy even at full price! It currently has the well deserved spot of #10th best game ever!  P.S. Feel free to reply to this review with questions; I usually reply rapidly. Also, if you decided to buy the game after reading this I'd be happy to help you out with the game, or play with you co-op if our times align! :)  Rating: 9.0/10 Halwin's 100% Completion RecommendationDifficulty: Unsure, but considering honour mode achievement I expect 9/10.

Bad Wolf,91,21,1,"November 18, 2016",Recommended,148.6,"This game is a clear upgrade from D:OS but if you've not played the game there's some things you need to know before buying.   This is a very traditional D&D styled RPG. This means that there'll be a lot of reading, a lot of exploring, puzzles and the game is generally quite difficult if you don't pay attention. As an older gamer this is a massive throwback to the games I played as a kid, but if you're into hardcore non stop action games this is not the game for you.  With that out of the way, if you're an RPG fan and you love getting lost in a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up and amazing world, this is the game for you."

Great customisation / flexibility   Multiple solutions to major quests   No ""get me 10 bear hides"" and no visible fetch and carry questsReally refreshing to play, DOS2 is a pinnacle of its kind. For the first play-through - stick to ""Origins"" characters  - i.e. more storyline that way. Technical: Graphics are colourful and vibrant.   Sound upbeat and clear.   Running this 4k ultra maxed and the framerate is ridiculously high.   15 hours in, not a single glitch / crash etc Want mwoaarr DOS!"
applekwisp,332,25,3,"December 14, 2017",Recommended,101.0,"Great RPG, probably one of the best games of 2017. It's strengths lie in an amusing colorful world, with and intresting, serious, yet lighthearted fantasy setting. The game is actually very rough around the edges the longer you play. It's polish runs out in the last 2 chapters as they feel rushed and maybe even unfinished. The difficulty curve of the game feels off since near the start it's very challenging, but towards the end you will become an unstoppable killing machine. Though there were many improvements over the first game, I still felt the first game had a better, focused story, better armor system, combat system (AP management) and pacing.  Pros  Lengthy RPG  Large variety of skills and character customization options  Dialogue is fun an intresting, a lot of world building in game  Combat is fun (though flawed). World skills like teleporting, pyramids, pickpocketing are intresting  Combat is very strategic (almost to a fault)  Very fair price for content. 100 hour playthrough doing every single quest I could. Cons  (Pro and Con I think) Teleport becomes a less useful skill in this game because of the availability of so many movement abilities to everyone.  A lot of broken achievements. Examples: pray at every altar on nameless isle, the quests associated with sebille, fane, most companions i assume  New armor system is bad. Encourages stacking either physical or magical damage. Late game it becomes irrelvant, everything is a one shot fest or everyone has an ability to completely strip your armor/magic resist  AP system is too limited compared to first game  Too many status effects and they are inconsistent. For example Rupture tendons can be used against armor, but bleeding will be blocked  Literally every battle will end covered in necrofire/fire. It makes bless a useless skill since it will ALWAYS be overwritten.  Source skills useless for first 2 areas, since you will never have enough source to use them (and wonder if they are worth saving for a truly difficult part that never comes) and overpowered for the rest of the game. Makes for a boring mechanic considering how central to the plot it is. Bless, source vampirism, and spirit vision aren't really compelling godwoken abilities honestly.  The story kind of forgets itself in the 2nd area. The game feels like a means to explore and do fun RPGeque quests, but the plot takes a backseat to it.  The final act feels unfinished. I felt like I ran into solutions to quests accidently more often than the ""correct"" way. Final battle and final choices don't feel like they were explained or fleshed out.  (EARLY SPOILER)The compnaion interaction with the game feels to forced. Everyone you meet is one of the most important people in the world. The companions who you don't pick early on, continuously show up even though you have no attachement to them at all.  Crafting, like in the first game, is exceptionally bad. You can never preview what the recipe is going to make. The receipe UI is super cluttered. Exiperimentaion is cumbersome. It's mostly luck based guessing, with a few ""skill books"". Good luck sorting through the UI with no search function or filters to get anything useful. Ignore the crafting system completely despite there being decent receipes like boots + nails, or status immunity potions. Overall a great game probably the GOTY, but I would reccomend people give the first game a chance beacuse I truly believe it is the better title between the two. A few of the characters and plot points carry over so it's worth taking into consideration before playing this game regardless. I feel like after a few patches, maybe an expansion, this game can be fixed up to be almost perfect, but for DOS is still the best example of kickstarter success and a modern CRPG with a classic taste to it."

Note when they join you get to choose their class (which is a great, original idea) but their race is fixed. Later on, you can respec all of their ability/talent/skill point selections if you want.  Items, equipment and enemies all seem quite interesting with lots of different stats and abilities. Controller(PS4,XBox) support is fantastic and it is fully playable via controller.

[FTA]TatsuyaSuou,289,131,20,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,114.8,"While there isn't a lot that hasn't already been addressed in other positive reviews, I feel obligated to address some of the negative reviews I continually see regarding the game's difficulty.  Like any strategy-oriented game, Divinity Original Sin 2 requires quite a bit of premeditation before entering combat to guarantee success (outside of Tactician mode anyway, more on that later).    The game expects you to use the tools it gives you in each encounter though the largest issue I've seen is when you enter a new section of the game.  Before you go exploring to much it's almost mandatory to address the guaranteed difficulty creep by checking out any and all new gear/skillbooks/potions etc are available in whatever new social area you encounter.  With the game's economy being what it is, having one character geared toward thievery and another set up with a significant amount of barter goes an incredibly long way toward alleviating the need to almost constantly upgrade your gear when entering a new section of the game.  The point I'm making is that the game gives you all the tools you need to address any gear issues you might have the moment you set foot in a new town. This goes for skill books as well as there is no limit to how many books you can learn as long as you have the commensurate ranks in the associated skill and sufficient memory slots to equip them.   Anyway, the TL;DR of all that is the game gives you all the tools you need to PREPARE for difficult fights so long as you actually use them.  All that said, the AI isn't a slouch.  It can and will abuse whatever environmental things are to hand and the devs have set up a great many of the fights to favor the enemies.  This means that as a player the onus is on you to think about the party you want to put together before just trying to breeze through the game.  There are so many ways to make strong characters in D:OS 2 that they're almost limitless.  What you CAN'T do and expect to be successful is to just blindly charge into every fight and new situation with your d*** at full mast (just a turn of phrase, no offense intended ladies).  If that's the playstyle you're after there are a dozen Diablo clones or ARPGs out there that are better suited to that frame of mind.  D:OS2 has a turned-based system for a reason and is incredibly rewarding just so long as you apply some forethought to engagements. In fact, it's easily the best RPG I've played since the early 2000s in terms of gameplay.   Panning a game for being difficult is a non-starter, especially when it's only as hard as you make it by lack of planning. Unless, of course, you're playing on Tactician mode.  If you're doing that, you deserve whatever mental anguish you're suffering from because that is almost entirely designed for masochists who like to sit bare‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•on a saguaro cactus.  If that's you, by all means, buy stock in razor blades or whatever but I would seriously hope to not see any complaints about difficulty."

I have had no issues with the game at all, and even alone the voice acting is keeping me playing. Feel free to check some valid negative reviews for problems that will most likely be fixed. And remember, there is always the option to reload to rethink and plan. Lets hope this stays constant through the game.  Ok, the Quest Log is broken as mentioned alot. And I found a couple of bugs.  The devs are working to fix problems, but they just do not have enough people to find all the bugs. I am 100% sure the game will be fleshed out within a couple months.  I also have heard that act 3 is kind of broken in a way, which I will experience myself. So far everything is beautiful and feels good, the graphics, audio, story telling, companions and all the other stuffs. As someone who enjoys smething and goes back afterwords to see everything, this will be a great experience.    Early Access review: Before you buy: Please go play atleast some of the first game if you wanted to play this. It is finished so a new player can enjoy the full experience. I have just been reading people complain about the early access too much to ignore this.     Oh and I very strongly recommend getting a friend to join you (There is a 2 player pack I pretty sure if you are feeling generous.) Without a friend that you can enjoy playing with,the beginning will be a struggle as it is a bit misleading.     Also the game is difficult in a way that makes a person have to think critically, making a restart is inevitable unless you are either a master at these games or just have played it a while. Having another person to talk to about positioning and cc (main points of the game) really makes a restart less frusturating and more of a learning experience until you get into the groove.  If you get this game I seriously hope you enjoyed it as much as the first one. Although I haven't beaten it completely I have enjoyed every step of the teleporting mess that it is.  Also. If you can only buy one get this one. Both are really great though"
Dellicious,292,71,1,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,55.6,"40 hours in and I've finally left Fort Joy and reached the mainland. Says it all really. I thought I was quite far in but turns out I've just scratched the surface. The depth is awesome, this is really the first game of this specific genre I have played, and I'm glad I took the risk on it. Incredibly immersing enviroments, music, story and characters. You really feel part of this world. Combat is very deep and I actually restarted the game twice before I was happy enough with my build and companions. Takes a bit of time if you are new to this series to get used to how classes and roles work, and how you should be building your team, but once you get the hang of it, it's fairly straightforward. The only negative I felt was that the journal gave a lack of direction on quests and objectives in general, but as soon as you stop treating them like quests and more like parts of a dynamic story it doesn't really matter. You can fail some, or do things wrong and that's okay it's part of your story. Often doing the wrong thing can get you some nice loot or information that helps you in some other way. Love it."

EDIT  And now since people started saying this isn't a review. no it is not it is simply a joke when i first started the game without any clue as to what i might end up with. i was at a moment of weakness when i just got my salary and came home drunk. so the next morning i started playing the game. here's an actual review based on my 9 hours of playtime.  the pros: -you have total freedom on how you want to play the game  (could also be seen as a con at times)  -indepth turnbased combat  (height matters and you have to anticipate that sometimes out from the shadows people can turn up to kill you)  -the origin characters have rich personality's and you don't really have to play as them to influence their story since they can also be your companions.  -story length.  there are 3 story acts that have a suprisingly long playtime and each time you want to replay it it's almost always different since like i said you have total freedom over what you will do. ( i play multiple characters but right now i am about 6 hours in on my undead witch and i haven't even come close to finish act 1 and from what i've heard of others act 1 can easily become 15 hours of playtime)  -OPTIMIZATION! this game's beautifull combat effects can clutter your whole screen and your computer (or laptop) can still run it smoothly  Now some small cons:  -*total freedom on how you play. sure is nice to play it however you want but... you must also discover each mechanic yourself (this is also how Grumps started a fight because i accidentally stole a book infront of the magister and also may have hit her with a knife before) also you can miss allot of story contents if you randomly kill people.  -tutorial is a bit vague sometimes and forgettable when you get too much on your plate because at same time you are fighting and trying to predict what your enemy is going to do.  after this there aren't many cons about this game that i can mention until i have actually experienced the full game and not just act 1. call me biased but just of the sheer size of the game you should try it. i can already sense this has allot of replay value."

However this game is not for you if you are bored by dialogue, this game is not for you if you dislike complexity and having to actually learn how to play and this game is not for you if you you require instant gratification.  For me, this game plays like a western version of a JRPG, with many characters to join your party, a deep complex story and many ways for you to affect the story.  The combat is turn based which allows for more depth in the combat system and more strategic options.  If you haven't tried turn based combat before, this is a great way to try it.  It's like Diablo but for intelligent adults.  Each origin character provides with a completely different gameplay experience even if you play them as the same class.

If you love story driven rpgs where the world you roam gives you adventure at every turn - this game is for you.   Positives: The myraid of ways you can build a character. I opted for more of a ""Warden"" route and enjoyed the freedom of veering outside of the confines of the usually locked in advancement systems found elsewhere.  The NPCs and their contribution to nearly every scene as well as their own storylines. I will admit I got a mod to allow me to take all of them along. Not so that the game would be easier but rather so I could experience all of their storylines in one playthrough. I was not disappointed. Best character development I have seen in an rpg in a long long time.  How big and developed the world is. Nearly every corner has you encountering some mystery, npc, adventure, or clue. Sometimes it can even be a little overwhelming but with time and effort - you can start mapping out everything.  The combat system. The built upon the previous one and improved its flaws. In the original, I would grenade and area effect arrow the hell out of everything. Sometimes allowed me to breeze through fights that should have required strategy. This time out - there isn't any overt easy tactics. In quite a few fights, you have to bring your strategy A game or die repeatedly.  Negatives Some of the puzzles got too clever for themselves and go well outside of the established routines of how to solve them. While in some cases this worked well, there are quite a few that gave you no starting reference point of how to even begin to solve them. This can lead to quite a bit of frustration and then gets compounded with the occasional bug that pretty much leads to a roll back save to try a different approach just to avoid the bug.   Endings. Big fan of anime here so I understand the idea of endings that aren't exactly clean but damn... the one that takes care of the most things literally nullifies the entire purpose of the game.

Heaveness,173,21,1,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,127.8,"I wanted to put at least minimum 20 hours into this game before I gave it a review. I can safely say that this is one of the best RPG games you will ever find, it's one of those games that will earn the definition of classic cRPG decades later. Normally I don't play a lot of turn-based tactical RPGs in my lifetime because I find the genre not my biggest interest but this game did a fantastic job enticing me into its universe.   Q: How does the game run? Any bugs or crashes or technical issues? A: In 30 hours of playing I have encounter maybe 1 or 2 bugs but I find them minor, for example, some quests did not classify as finished when I just got the reward for it. I have not experienced a single crash in any of my games and did not run to any framerate issues.  Q: Do you recommend it or not? A: Absolutely recommend it! The game is very well-made, the developers really poured their heart and soul into this game and it shows. It has online & local splitscreen coop, PvP, Tactical combat, controller support, mods, great writing, so much paths and methods to tackle any quest, Game Master Mode, and much more. I can tell the Larian Studios had a blast making this and it's thanks to them and the kickstarters backers that help fund this fantastic game.  Overall score: 10/10 Pros:  +Fun and challenging tactical combat  +Easy to get into but hard to master +Interesting and unique characters with the companions having their own origin stories. +Mod Support +A well-implemented coop feature that doesn't feel tacked on. +Beautiful Soundtrack +Definitely more than 100 hours of content. +Very well polished with little to no bugs or crashes and haven't experienced any framerate issues so far. +Game Master Mode which is a DnD style game which is a interesting way to play the game with friends. +Multiple ways to tackle an objective. +You have a ton of freedom and choice. +The graphics look great with some pretty locations. +So much secrets and this game encourages to carefully look and explore its world.  Neutral: =The voice acting for the most part is good but some are odd and feels inconsistent when it comes to the audio quality but it does its job. =The quest journal I find to be a clunky with the map. When you have multiple quests active, you have multiple markers on the map that just seems messy and confusing. Although it is not hard to figure out what you are suppose to be doing. =A few quality-of-life changes would have been nice like increasing the walking speed outside of combat or having the hotbar not be cluttered whenever you pick up an item like a grenade. Luckily these two problems can be fixed with a mod.  Cons: -Honestly there is zero cons I can think of for this game, other than on higher difficulties the enemies like to use a lot of cheese tactics which can be frustrating to deal with but you can use those same tactics on them too.  I'll definitely play this game much more and I have still a lot more content to explore and be playing them with my friends whenever I get the chance. I highly recommend you get this game, I gave it a 10/10 rating not as a ""This game is perfect in every way,"" the game has a few issues, but it's more of a ""This game is worth every penny of your purchase"" kind of rating. Pick this game up for yourself or with 3 other friends, you will not regret it! "

Ramdhanu,265,13,0,January 14,Recommended,173.9,"Divinity Original Sin 2.  While Original Sin was already a good RPG game and had plenty to offer, I was a bit skeptical that whether or  not Larian Studios could top that. But boy did they. Original Sin 2 is better than the first in every way. It‚Äôs safe to say that Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of the best, if not the best RPG of year,especially for us old school pen & paper rpg lovers.  While RPG's are all about choices & consequences & development of your character,you don't find many PC RPG's that offer this kind of choices,where your decisions and actions are so impactful. Meaning, You can kill an NPC related to the main quest,try to steal from a vendor & loose access to their inventory,build your dream character or a good for nothing crew,the choices are limitless . There is always another way to take care of your duties if you fail in one. In other worlds, Larian was able to  PUT THE R BACK IN RPG in this game.  Another really strong aspect of Divinity Original Sin 2 is its characters,especially the SIX Origin Characters to choose from who have rich backstories and amazing voice-acting to boot. Similar to Dragon Age Origins,the Origins lets you play as unique characters with their own agendas & goals. And if you want to create a custom character,then fret not,you can have them as companions in your journey. One piece of advice though. There's a nasty piece of surprise waiting for you at the end of ACT 1. So choose & build your companions carefully.  As far as gameplay is concerned, there‚Äôs nothing new or innovative in terms of gameplay, but rather, a refined version of what we‚Äôve already had for years. The only thing complicated is stuff like crafting or spell combinations and such. But once you have a general idea of how they work, you‚Äôll be breezing through them.  The game also  comes with an amazing soundtrack, very fitting for whatever situation you‚Äôre in. Additionally, the VFX sounds, be it for blood spatter or whatever fancy spell you‚Äôre flinging, and the sounds that the weird creatures and characters you come across make, it all fits right in place. Not to mention,the entire game is voice acted & makes the experience all the more enjoyable, especially for those experiencing the genre for the first time.  Similarly, no complaints with the visuals. While it‚Äôs not an extremely graphic intensive by today‚Äôs standards, but still it delivers a very visually appealing experience. The environments look great and the details in the surroundings, be it inside a ship, or a cabin, or out in the open (anywhere really), is amazing.  Overall, one will have a hard time finding another RPG like this one around. Divinity does a lot of things right and I have to hand it to Larian Studios for creating an RPG masterpiece here. The plethora of options that actually matter, the rich characters, the story itself, this game has a lot going for it. You won't & cannot go wrong with buying this game,whether on full price or on a deal.  My Verdict 9.5/10.  PS : Fund Divinity Original Sin 3 if they are going to create it in the future. What Larian has shown us so far, it is well worth to pay them the full price & something extra for their efforts."

ArenMook,174,16,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,390.6,"If you've enjoyed the first Divinity: Original Sin, you owe it to yourself to pick up this one. Larian took everything that was great about the first game and made it even better.  Word of warning though, it's easier to screw up in DOS2 than it is in DOS1. Literally a minute into the game you can either recruit or kill your first companion, simply depending on how you talk to them.  Stealing mechanics changed from DOS1 -- both guards and whoever owns the item will actively seek out the thief (you), and should they find you red-handed, throw you in prison, attack or simply take the stolen merchandise, again depending on how you talk your way out of the situation. Fortunately even if you choose the violent option, the game is still perfectly playable. Merchants and civilians don't participate in the fight.  I'd write more, but I think I'll just go ahead and play some more instead."
Kad,9,29,0,August 30,Recommended,66.4,"Originally I wasn't going to review this game on this account because I have few hours on this account. However, reading through some of the reviews out there, I wanted to speak my piece.  This game changes things from the previous game in the series. And some argue that it makes the game harder, forcing you to play as a certain type of character. However, I feel the need to point out that you are only forced into playing a certain way if you desire to be the absolute best possible character in the game. People say that mixed damage parties are not viable because of the armor system in the game. (If you are unaware, every character in the game has an amount of Physical Armor and Magical Armor. These armors prevent damage and certain effects until they are depleted.) However, me and a friend did a playthrough of this game, and we played as a mixed damage party. For those who are interested, we had: a Summoner who also had abilities in Aerothurge, Pyrokinetic and Geomancer. That was my main. a Ranger who focused on long range physical damage, but also dabbled in Pyrokinetic. That was my secondary character. a Rogue who focused almost entirely on Physical damage. That was my friend's main. a Cleric who used Hydrosophist and Warfare, and acted as our team's tank. That was my friends secondary character. The point of that is to show that we had a diverse build to our team. Sure, it may not have been the most effective. But do you know what it was? Fun. We had a lot of fun playing that party. So, before you get this game, ask yourself this. Do I want to be able to create a character who is unique to my playstyle, even if they are not necessarily the best? If you say yes, then you will enjoy this game. There are so many options for what you can do. However, if you want to build the best possible character, then unfortunately, you will likely be disappointed with how you will need to build a certain way. However, is that not what something being the best mean? If one object is better than all other objects of the same type, does that not mean that in that catagory, there is no other choice besides that one object? It is the same for looking at the builds in Divinity: Original Sin 2. Yes, one is better than all the other. However, if you only play to have the best build, then I think you are missing the entire point of the game. This game is meant to be a medium for telling a story, for sharing memories. While you can play the game alone, it is my belief that for the true experience of the game, you should play it with friends. And when you do, feel free to play however you desire. I will lead to some good laughs when you look back at it."
Aisukurimu,24,12,0,May 30,Recommended,595.9,"In short, this is a game of high replayability with an immensely immersive world.    Quests Quests are in one way or another, interrelated to each other, they are not shallow ""fetch quests"" and each one actually reflects a little bit about the world of Rivellon. Players are not required to complete quests in any certain ways as each path you take is considered progression towards the ultimate goal. There are also  multiple ways to approach a single quest, whether it is to be a righteous individual and not ask for reward; to be a villain who only cares for your own self interest; or having to choose between two evils knowing either choice will have undesirable sacrifices. You could encourage a man to not dwell on pursuing vengeance and be merciful, perhaps that man will not stray from his righteous path, but he might  lose something/someone else .    Gameplay In terms of gameplay, I was initially not a fan of turn-based combat, which is largely what this game is about. I was more accustomed to ARPG-like combat as seen in Diablo 3. However, I allow myself to give this game a try despite my dislike of turn-based combat. It was a good decision as I later found myself so engaged by the turn-based combat in this game. Combat in this game has  great depth due to abilities being able to interact with the game environment, like creating chain explosions by casting fire on a poison/oil surface; or electrocuting an enemy and stunning him because you've already pre-casted a water surface beneath him. What's more amazing is that the  combat AI also make use of these mechanics! The combat has great potential for a highly strategic approach and it is very satisfying to see your strategies in effect. After multiple playthroughs, I realised that there are so many possible approaches to a single fight, and sometimes one mistake is all it takes to bring the player down from an advantageous position that could ultimately mean deaths of characters or even defeat of the whole party (The combat AI is no joke on higher difficulties, really smart and makes really calculated moves, which made the game more fun for me).    General experience In terms of the general RPG experience, personally I think the game has a  good amount of both combat and dialogues/stories. Dialogues are fully voiced and occasionally amusing. NPCs' responses in dialogue actually depend on players' races. There are also ""tags"" which can be selected when creating a custom character, these  tags allow you to do certain things that other tags cannot. For example, a character with a Scholar tag can interpret ancient tomes and gain knowledge from it; whereas a character with a Mystic tag is able to use their own sheer will to repel evil presence possessing innocent people to attack travellers. There are also ""Origin"" characters, which are essentially characters that already have their own backgrounds in the world of Rivellon and by playing as them/recruiting them as companions, you gain access to their own quests that might sometimes  intertwine with other Origin characters' quests.    Conclusion These are my personal views on what makes this game great for me. There are more exciting features that this game has which I don't think a single review can contain. If you like RPG games that leaves you an empty space after completing it, this is one such game. And the price tag is definitely modest for a game this big."

Nether,23,28,0,"August 7, 2017",Recommended,215.5,"Im super excited for the release date, if you're into Dragon Age or RPGs with turn-based combat, Id /strongly/ recommend it.   This is the first of the DOS games I tried, but after trying the alpha, which Ive spent 30 hours in (of the ""suggested"" 8-12 hours), I went back and played the D:OS 1, I was genuinely surprised to see it was a decent game, but also realizing that it actually is lightyears behind this one, D:OS 2.   It doesnt have the live combat, which DA has, but its turn based where the attack time is based on your characters' strengths and weakness' (for lack of better simplistic explanation) - Id personally take the real time action over this one, but it still seems to be well-made.   I think its a bit deceiving with the main character's customization, as the characters you find throughout the game can matter just as much, if not more. Only benefit is a bit of options to change the look. Additionally, I think its a shame you can swap the discovered characters in between different ""conflicting speccs"" as you find them, as in, mage OR warrior and not just pick between whether you want the warrior to be in a defensive or aggressive build - it ruins a bit of the RP feel of the characters in my mind. You could have the option to swap between the conflicting paths, but then you should get a RP story explaining why that it is a possibility, and only have it as a rare trait to some of them. If you're playing on high difficulty, having this would mean you directly need to find a healer/tank/rogue to unlock certain skills/benefits.   Im lacking a bit of character story and overall story, which you can find in the early Dragon Age games, but it hardly affects my belief of the game. Im excited to see how the late game develops, as Im afraid you get overpowered a bit too soon, in addition to the fact that the cookie cutter builds seem to be a bit too either overpowered, or obvious.   One thing I actually spite, is the fact that the amount of discovered/hidden ""legendary"" weapons are slightly too many, and of too high importance. If you're playing on max difficulty, you're almost forced to google to find them, in order to being able to beat the NPC/AI. Atleast this is the case if youre in the range of my skill-level, which admittedly isn't perfect.   Everything I could think of on the spot, September cant come soon enough."

Aries,82,14,0,"September 20, 2016",Recommended,86.8,"So far the game has been a joy to play. The game has taken up a notch both in gameplay and in looks since the last DOS-game. The combat is more fluid and enjoyable, the effects are as beautiful as they go most of the time and the dialogue is quite well written. But now I can get to the biggest complaint I have: Voice acting or the lack of. At the moment the only voice acting is in the intro and combat grunting. There is no dialogue voice acting so you have to read everything. That can be a good thing, true but I myself prefer voices. The rumors have told that there would never be any voice acting but we'll see if that's true in the final game. This is early access after all.  All in all Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an amazing game right from the start and this is in alpha. We have a lot more to get and the things we have now already impress. I haven't made it that far as of yet since I have been testing out a lot of stuff but I can already say quite a bit about general things."

If you like turn-based combat, then buckle up for a robust and freeing combat and class system. You really can play the game the way you want to play it.   If you're looking for something to play with friends, this is a great game for that too. You can have a party of 4 players total, so why not bring three pals to accompany you on the perilous journey ahead.   Have no friends? Not to fear, speaking from my own experience, the game is still incredibly fun to play solo. You can customize each NPC party member, command them in combat, and switch between them at any point should you so choose.  This game does a lot, and absolutely nails all of it."

Like Gandalf after the Balrog fight, I lay like roadkill on Gaming‚Äôs Last Stand. Left in the ditch by the ravenous, greedy games industry, all but forcing me to violently amputate myself from my hobby after so many years, my thoughts returned to me through the mist of my mind. Game publishers had made me hate gaming more and more with every Microtransaction, Gambling Lootbox, and √ºbergreedy DLC-pettiness, rubbing their scummy hands together, waiting for their chance to turn me so desperate that I'd sell my mum's wheelchair just to be able to play the story of a single player game wholesale instead of in disgusting piece-meal chunks.  Exhausted. Ready to let my hobby die.  Clearing my head to drift forever into the mindless, mainstream, middle-aged hobbies of pathetic Rom-Coms so bad they have to tell you where to laugh, sports night with a team letting you down for 20 years straight, and pedantic tv-gameshow hosts as full of themselves as the CEOs and board members of todays‚Äô AAA game companies.  I had cried out for Mr. Newell, but he was nowhere to be seen. I called out for him again and again, desperately trying to summon the one time so great mythical Valve Overlord to give me a glimpse of Half-Life 3 or some other new IP, for a last incongruent attempt to restore my faith in The Greatest Hobby ever known. But Mr. Newell had sojourned to the evil gates of DOTA 2 many moons ago, and had never been seen since. Every Valve knave had followed their once and future king, but in their wake had only left silence for those few of us who still cared. Their footprints, all leading to DOTA 2, and not one leading back, had all but vanished.  And amidst the Consumer Forest behind Valve Village, there was talk of another presence, only whispered in fear, between creeping darkness and depressive thoughts; Artifact... Artifact... The wind carried the promise of a terrible omen, of yet another unnecessary card game to come, assuring the deliverance of the final strike into the once golden, now charred, heart of gaming. And Mr. Newell never appeared in this, my darkest hour. The heroic saviour was lost to time and space as he had succumbed to The Void of Game Industry Indifference.  My mind wandered. Valve Village lay in ruins. Long was the time since anyone had fixed anything on the barricades of Team Fortress, and the walls of Counter-Life: Grognard Operations' padded cells had crumbled, leaving demons and hell-outcasts running rampant and harassing any remaining villagers. There were rumors that some of the worst of these creatures had even snuck after Gabe through the gates of DOTA, in the Unholiest of Unholy joinings of good and evil, but none had heard back from them either. The Portals to the temple of Half-Life were rusted to a sad metal heap, and the temple they guarded had lied dormant for centuries with no Programmer Priests or Artist Acolytes left to work on the Half-Life religion. Valve Village was a ghost town. Dying at last, together with me.  I felt my body getting numb. I knew I was close to exhaling my last breath of gaming. Doomed to never experience the warm freedom from pathetic corporate game publisher mind tricks. Never allowed again to experience the sheer joy of a great game not tormented by CEO and board member greed.  I closed my eyes.  I made my peace with everything. Accepting of Bobby Kotick‚Äôs miniscule loaf-member, mercilessly drilling down the insides of my throat and demolishing my gag reflex for all time. No more protesting Zenimax‚Äô and Bethesda‚Äôs Pete Hines lying and lying, his nose getting longer and longer inbetween my butt cheeks as he denounced the fact that their new paid mods system is indeed paid mods. I let out a poor sigh as I came to terms with EA‚Äôs horror show, drowning me and their other customers in blank-white secrete of filthy business decisions, in amounts so vast they could shave their chiseled, unethical game publisher jawline in the mirroring reflection of my soaked forehead.  Nothing mattered anymore. We, the customers, had lost. And as a single tear ran down my cheek, gaming was dead and gone forever. I embraced the darkness and muttered a final prayer to the gaming gods of old, before feeling a last remaining speckle of life vanish from my veins. My gamer soul was ready. I was to return home to 8bit, 16bit, Playstation and PC; to the 80s and 90s gaming heaven. Far away from the grotesque demonic onslaught hell here, far from the karmic injustice of game publishers burning the industry down until they had extinguished its last pittance of grace. I was ready. And darkness came.  Then, movement.  Not from me. Outside of me.  A feather of light touched my eyes. A vague, finely tuned iota beam, shimmering onto my eyelids. It tormented my weak sight, but it was real! A light, a light! My body jolted as it shone towards me from the distant skies. My butt-crack ravaged, my throat sore, my forehead glistening with horrible, sticky Microtransaction DLC. I was not dead yet, there was a game title coming closer, flapping it's angel wings as it descended upon my old, withered gamer soul. And I could see the shape and the coming of Divinity: Original Sin 2 as the air around me became warmer and I felt life returning to me.  Larian had come to my rescue. They would not let me fall to the demonic creature game publisher overlords. They would conquer this Normandy, they would sail this Pacific. They would go on until the end. And no micro DLC could stand in their way of delivering the atomic bomb which destiny would have in itself the strenght and honour to become 2017s GOTY.  Long live Larian, the New Gamer Wine. The Future World Leader in cRPGs. The Youthful Lords of Gaming.  Support this developer. Sell your kids, dogs, and a kidney if you must. But support them, please. Drop them a bundle of cash from a helicopter, write your will today and give it all to Larian. Or do something else more or less creative. But promise me you‚Äôll support them.

Sorry to all other candidates; you had clever minds, firm bottoms and perky puppies, but when Larian is sporting the combinad sass of Audrey Horne, beauty of an elven princess and the lust of a thousand pornstars to entertain me, there just isn't any competition worth to be had anymore.

Going full initiative makes sure you always get to play first. You can kill all enemies before they have a first turn (on highest difficulty!)  - Obvious huge gaps in item upgrades  - Pickpocketing still way too broken (unlimited gold/all shopitems for free)  - Having 1% magic armor is enough to stop all debuffs  - Enemies too easy to crowd control (stun / freeze / knock down spam)  - Rangers STILL do too much damage (very broken in first game)  - No penalty for poor intelligence / low magic skill. Your spells will always land and you will always have 100% chance to crowd control. You can have a warrior/rogue/ranger hybrid mage. Having a pure mage is such a waste.  - Whole game revolves around the ""teleport"" spell or simular transportation abilities  - TOO many abilities that allow you to escape or move enemies. You can never get hit by melee enemies, and you can always teleport enemy ranger/mage infront of your melee team and just insta-kill them on highest difficulty.  - Almost all of the quests are broken. If you don't do them in the correct order (which means you can't explore anything) you can never complete them. Even the final quest of Act 1  - When you start a fight, your characters run around and position them selves very awkwardly. Even if you pre-set them in high ground etc they will run down and just stand somewhere totally unconvenient  - Sometimes the conversations always end in the same way, no matter what you choose to say. For example; you argue with an NPC. The outcome is exactly the same no matter if you win or lose the argument  - Argument stats (intimidate, wits, intelligence etc) don't matter. If you have maxed out your strenght you will still lose intimidation checks vs. cowards, if that's what the game-designers intended.  CONCLUSION! ‚Ä¢ All non-direct damage spells need to be nerfed alot.   ‚Ä¢ Debuff vs. magic armor system needs to be reworked.  ‚Ä¢ Conversations need to matter (it's an RPG for crying out loud..)  ‚Ä¢ Exploring shouldn't be punished by breaking quests.  ‚Ä¢ Crafting is totally pointless and needs to be reworked.  ‚Ä¢ Pickpockets needs a huge nerf.. since the starting area I have had the best items available to me.    There are alot of things that need improving and changing, obviously it being in EARLY ACCESS. I still recommend the game because I really enjoyed the first one and I know/hope they won't polish this one any less.  Hoping they put alot of effort into balancing things out so I don't feel like a God at level 2 (on highest difficulty);   I will probably rate the game 8/10 when complete (and nerfed)."

Aporis,124,96,16,"October 11, 2017",Recommended,88.0,"TL;DR. A damn crab on the beach is more deeper character than any NPC in Skyrim or Fallout 4 ever. Gameplay is so much more enjoyable and deeper than for example the Witcher series. Characters are relatable and funny like in Mass Effect games! Makes me so salty to think about it that they stuffed all this to one single indie title...  PROS: After finishing my 14 hour tutorial (EDIT: NVM I'm STILL IN THE TUTORIAL) I can already say this game does everything right and I ducking love it! This is the game that made me belive in the game industry again. I didn't like turn based combat, until now. I didn't like isometric point of view, until now. I didn't care too much about ingame conversations, until now. An RPG game you can play with FRIENDS and even cause drama in the scale of Mario Kart! Dialogue is far from monotonic and doesn't take itself too seriously. Voice acting is excellent to the point I found myself stopping to listen to the dialogue even tho I had finished reading it a while ago. I haven't had this rewarding and brain stimulating singleplayer experience for as long as I can remember. I haven't enjoyed this deep, different and open ways of approach to different situations ever in a videogame before.  If you're being like me and see all the reviews and think ""Should I buy this? What if I don't like it? It's so expensive"" JUST BUY IT IN THE NAME OF SOURCE! You won't regret it meow.  CONS: -Can't play accordion. -Steals your life."

GaloreDruid,54,10,1,April 5,Recommended,223.9,"I have not finished this game yet, currently I am approaching the end of act 2. That certainly goes to show something about the amount of content in this game, considering how many hours I've already played this game for. So far, I have a good grasp on what this game is like, so I'll give you a list of the good and bad.  Pros: Lots of content You have the option to do what quests you want to Quests have multiple ways of doing them Insane freedom is given in this game which I think RPGs tend to be lacking in (for story choices) Difficult fights that give a sense of achievement Variety of fights (no 2 fights are the same) The story Dialogue is all voice acted. Voice lines sound like there was a lot of thought put into each one. Dialogue for animals when you have pet pal This game achieves having a serious tone while having humor at the same time Descriptions for items are hilarious (ex. dismembered foot, ""All five toes, check! An attacked leg, Uhhhh..."" or when you click on a globe the narrator says, ""And you thought Rivellon was flat"") Insignificant NPCs still have voice lines, which really improves the immersion into the game You can steal whatever you want and kill whoever you want, however, there is an attitude system that punishes you for that Origin Characters in the game have interesting back stories The game allows you to have a romance with all the origin characters, including a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing skeleton, no more needs to be said. There are no traditional classes you are stuck to. You can mix and match whatever spells you want. For example, you could try going double shields with no weapon, and the spell ""shield throw."" I don't know why you would want to do it, but its possible The game is begging to be replayed with all the different builds on characters, origin character stories, and the ridiculous amount of choices you can make. The game has a tag system where your character earns tags through their actions, which gives you more dialogue options, and determines how npcs react to you. Elemental surfaces in combat are a very fun mechanic to work with. Races you pick in this game (Dwarf, Elf, Lizard, Human, and all the undead versions) all have unique abilities and tags unique to the races.  Cons: You can be thrown into a fight you don't expect (which can be also a pro depending on how you see it) Sometimes areas are high level to discourage you from going into them yet. This can get confusing when you don't know that there is another area with lower level enemies. You will use google at some point during this game. Some puzzles/ quests can be very difficult to figure out how to complete. Quicksave often, sometimes you might accidentally steal an item you didn't mean to if you click the wrong thing when moving. Devs, please just remove taunt entirely or change it. It's only one fight in the entire game so far that I've had to deal with this, but watching my character taken over by ai for a turn or two and using every scroll and source ability in my inventory is not an enjoyable game mechanic. Especially since it now pierces armor.  Overall, this is a great game that I would encourage you to give a try. It has some negatives, but they are definitely worth dealing with for the insane amount of positives the game has. The game has really good devs who seem to want to deliver a quality product, which they have. Out of all the RPGs I've tried, this is the best in my opinion."

Kaaros Aleri,331,13,4,"March 29, 2017",Recommended,189.3,"Short Version: The game is fudgin awsome, and in my opinion lives up to the Original Sin (hehe), Dialogue is better, Combat is slightly different but still just as fun, though the attributes still needs work and ballancing, the drop in multiplayer sucks massive Cysealean Fish gonads because of the almost non-existant host controls and no in-game voice chat that i could find, though in organized play can probably be the most awesome experience in the game because of the awesome saves that can happen with you and your friends. I rate the game a 9/10 with the multiplayer a 5/10.  This review will be mainly on singleplayer gameplay, of which i have player over 24 hours during the writing of this review and i will try not to spoil or touch the main story, quests and puzzles.           Gameplay 8.7/10                     The gameplay, much like it's predescessor, is a turn based RPG a la classic fallout and in my experience is much faster paced than fallout and Divinity: Original sin. The difference in gameplay from Divinity: Original sin is that the action system is more compact, some attributes were replaced to make things more simpler, defence from physical and magical attacks as secondary ""health"" bars instead of %reduced, a character past system that gives you new dialogue, and that the dreaded rock paper scissor persuasion system is gone. Many sees the changes as a double edges sword as it removes the more familiar aspects of the game, but to me it was very easy to learn which may have been the intent of the studio and you can take this as a negative or a positive.      Dialogue and persuasion system   10/10   Better than previous system in my opinion  The player dialogue changes i very much appreciated, especially the removed rock paper scissor system, the character past dialogue is interesting and suprisingly incredibly useful as you can get minor help from NPCs, an example would be ""MINOR SPOILER""  in the cave there is a lizard who sells physical weapons, armor, and spellbooks that will give you a minor discount for having the soldier tag  .      Combat Gameplay   9/10   It's different though not much better than the previous system in my opinion.  The gameplay and combat is still quite similar to it's predescessor, but much more fast paced and flashy, especially the new source magic though some of it can be underwhelming. Many of the combat changes seems to be based around the new magic and physical armor system, particularly the damage dealt within one round of combat seems to have been bumped up by a lot both NPC and playable characters compared to the older system.  The difficulty around the armor system can sometimes be glaring because magic, to me, is a much greater threat than physical attacks because of the almost ridiculous amounts of dangerous magical effects that enemies utilize like  poison, stun, fire, frozen, and curse  compared to the physical debilitations,  cripple, knockdown and in rare cases bleed  being the most dangerous physical ones. The good thing about the new system is that as long as you have the type of armor the effect/element affects the debilitation will only be applied when that armor bar is fully depleted, though some can see this as a negative since i actually liked the willpower/bodybuilding system.  Physical combat is still a very good way to do focused damage on one particular enemy, but is more devastating on one with little to no physical armor as  a well placed  barrage of arrows and melee hits can dispatch those enemies very quickly, though the same can't be said for monsters fighting against the playable characters unless the players are underleveled, but a proper and well built team can still kill enemies 3 levels higher than them.      Attribute changes   7/10   Simplifying things doesn't mean better, this is a good example. Worse than the previous system but is still okay in my opinion. The attribute changes to me are weird, like dr seuss weird, wits being too good with it affecting initiative and perception, constitution does not affect anything other than health, memory not affecting anything other than amount of spells (in my opinion it should affect some dialogue or something out of combat), and intelligence, having the same problem with memory only affecting combat and spells with no change in dialogue or out of combat stuff, strength is still heavily affecting combat very useful for throwing and lifting stuff and other out of combat stuff but is still overtaken by telekenessis, finesse only seems to affect combat and theivery, all in all the attribute changes are pretty wonky compared to the previous game.     Multiplayer   Drop in 3.1/10  oh boy.    Organized 10/10  I've not played organized multiplayer but i can see it being incredibly fun. I've only played multiplayer once and it was drop in multiplayer, and first impressions are the most important especially for new players. There are very little controls for the host of the game, for a game based heavily based on teamwork and tactics there is no voice chat from what i can find, the kick function does not work properly because a player can just rejoin particularly trolls and greifers. A help bar and proper command console/tab for hosts can help tremendously, adding a function that ban players from the server, and an option for local voice chat can help drop in play by a lot.  "

Marius,161,10,0,August 3,Recommended,270.2,"This game was amazing. The complex combat kept pulling me back to it. The story was immersive. I am writing this review to warn you about the end. The game is amazing until you get to the end. The game all of a sudden wants to throw weird puzzle mechanics that just don't fit with the flow of the game. They are also really annoying. Some boss fights don't follow the combat mechanics but yet your party does. The bosses do like 10 things at once and get back all of their AP (action points) on their next turn. If you played it on lone wolf, then you are able to do it too, but reccommended for advance players. My last warning before you buy this beautiful game is that the game still has bugs in it. There are many quest that can glitch out resulting in you not getting the xp or the award for completing the quest. There is a large list of them and you can google them when the time comes. I only had the one quest bug on me when i played through the game. Others had at least 10 + quest bug out for them. Worth it to the very end."

I hate all the animals in this game I start the game on a ship at sea, after a couple of pop-ups to get started I notice a sheep in a pin. Sheep are adorable so of course I want to pet the sheep, right? I tell her she's so cute and fluffy I wish I could pet her forever and I ask if can have a tiny piece of her wool. ""What?! A piece of my wool? It's bad enough I'm stuck on this boat, now you want to cut a b%$#h?!""   I can take a hint, so I keep walking and see a dog. Doggo! Doggo's are always cool so this must be where the game tells you that you can have a pet, I can't wait to get... ""I will bite you directly in your @$$."" Uh, don't you mean 'on' my... ""I said WTF I meant!!!"" I'm starting to think I should not have taken the ability to speak to animals.  Before any other animals can make me feel like crap, the ship is attacked. I run outside and there are MASSIVE Kraken tentacles wrapped around the hull trying to snap the ship in half. I do not know what the Kraken was so angry about, I didn't ask because I watch anime and I know a set-up when I see one.   Most of the crew gets washed up on the shore of a penal colony. I sit on the beach and think about how lucky I am, poking the sand with a stick, and a little crab scuttles by. Hello little crab. ""How DARE you address me, puny miserable flesh-stick! I am the most powerful sorcerer IN THE WORLD, I will banish you to the depths of the void with the click of my claw! Your soul will burn in endless agony! You will rue the day you crossed...."" She's gonna be a while so I decided to leave, but this rat who saw what happened is like ""Wow you just got owned! You look like you still scared, you scared little chicken, bwaak bwaak little chicky chicky!""   $%#t-talked by a rat, because FML I guess.  I try to learn to fit in, get on with life, but I got in trouble and was thrown into prison which is odd since this is already a penal colony, so I guess this is technically super-jail? Anyway, I do find an escape tunnel but it's inhabited by giant fire-slugs. I try to sneak passed, but one of them catches me and demands to know what I'm doing. I'm trying to get the hell out of here. She says that's perfect and informs me that she is in fact royalty and in need of a messenger. ""You will carry my Royal Decree to all the lands far and wide, Her Royal Majesty is now accepting inquiries and courtships from suitable bachelors of notable lineage!"" Ok, so basically you'll let me pass on the condition that I tell people you're single and searching? ""Correct! I expect only the finest and most wealthy Courtiers!"" But, you're a giant snot-bug.

Personally to me feels very handcrafted instead of how alot of newer games tend to feel cut and pasted. PROS +game design- if you think through all situations and are willing to die a few times trying there are many different ways to complete any situation. +graphics- my pc is not grand(base alianware alpha I3 until i pay my house down and build my new pc this winter) and i run this game at 1440p high graphics and around 30 fps( never dipping below) +choice-i truely feel like i have a say at some parts of this game( hence i said someparts, this is very clsoe to a pen and paper but does fall short as will all games every played with any type of AI, it is just in the nature.) +difficulty- i know this has been a hot subject since alot of people are finding the game a little to difficult but it is my own opinion, i play on tactition mode, have 1.) undead poly, ranger. 2.)normal summoner lohse. 3.) normal rouge sibille. 4.) normal geo, warfare beast.  and i find the enocunters to be very difficult but i really enjoy a true challenge, as well as a challenge to know when i am out matched( does not happen often for most games now a days with all the monsters leveling with you. eg The Elder Scrolls Online, )i do enjoy that game too.)) +balance- while this is not a perfect positive i felt it worth noting. no game can be perfectly balenced but i feel as though my build setup(see note above) is far from perfect and yet i play on the hardest normal difficulty. and to me that is saying something, i did not feel like i had to play a certain way to enjoy the harder fights.  now for some of the bad i did notice.  -the number one thing i saw in this game that was missing... it is most likely something small to most but enemys and other npcs have things on their body that is not in their inventory. now i dont mind not having the armour and weapons, i would feel like i would be overwelmed with over powered things that would make me feel to powerfull( i dont enjoy that it gets boring, i like the fight just to stay in the fight.) but if i could use my rouge to sneak and replace a healing potion with a poison bottle, that would change the game for me. allow me to steal things( if i was tacticle about manuvering the land not to get caught.) that might hinder my teammates useless for fights. i just feel like that would be the cherry atop the already iced and sprinkled cake. -difficulty- i personally understand why alot of people dont like the way the game was made more (difficult) with it only being a stat buff to the enemys, and a rather drastic one at that, so i think there could be more difficulty modes, and take the one good thing from ark Survival evolved and add a slider for a custom difficulty( this is supposed to mimic a pen and paper like dnd give the players the choice.   there are more pros and cons to this game, but these were the ones i felt i would want to know about if i were trying to decide on buying this or not.  for me this game is a solid 10/10 there is room for improvment in any game but give credit where it is do. this game deserves it, it is rather a amazing title.  P.S. this is one of the maybe 4-7 games i have bought non-steamsale. i do not regret it at all and would very much recomend it to single player or multiplayer. thank you for reading this far and i hope this review helped you make a decision.( ask any questions you guys may have and i will do my best to answer!)  EDIT*  one more thing that I thought of that I personally feel should be fixed, as far as combat goes I don't mind the stat buff or the enemy having shorter cool down for skills then you do.  with that said the game should not allow an enemy to have free range of sight, what I mean is I have seen so many times that if I am in range but not within line of sight a enemy can hit you but not vice versa.  to me this is far from a game breaking bug. but it is the only way I feel gimped in any true way cause I cant truly have all power over placing my troops since ( in some cases) enemys could fire through that brush that I hid behind while shooting the other guy, with that said it also does not happen that often."

Why? I get it. You saw some screenshots, watched some videos and probably you don't like some elements of the game. It's nothing like what you've played before, and you thought well it's not your type, doesn't suit your taste. I know, people are way too individualized. But, what defines your taste? Youtubers? Streamers? Friends? Game Studios? No. It's yours. A true gamer never stops exploring. Every once in a while you need to step out of your comfort zone and try something different. Yes, from what you've learned about this game, your prejudices are probably 100% accurate, but if you haven't tried it, please don't believe you won't like it.   If you've had the patience to read thus far, stir up a bit of courage and buy this game. Just sit back, empty your mind, and DOS2 will expand it, then blow it up into pieces.   If for some stupid reason you are still reluctant to try this game, it would be such a painful loss, a shame and a pity for both me and you.

Rhuzkii,243,29,2,"October 1, 2016",Recommended,394.9,"This game is incredible! I can't tell you though which game of the series is better, seeing that they are both AMAZING!  I just wanted to give some feedback on the things I personally think are too overpowered. So I played as a elf warrior, and your race ability as elf is that you get 1 AP and + 25% dmg for some constitution. Then as a warrior you have enrage, which gives you 100% crit, and you can choose a talent called ""War Lord"" which enables you to get 2 AP back when you execute an enemy. With Warrior having 3 charges (Blitz Attack, Battering Ram and Phoenix Dive) which only cost 1 AP and Crippling Blow and Whirlwind as AoE you can easily solo pretty much everything. Those things in combination with the golden double handed axe you can buy from an NPC not that far into Fort Joy's story line you are just way too powerful compared to everything else. I mean pretty much all I did with Lohse and Sebille was relocating enemies using Teleportation and then just utterly demolishing everyone with my warrior. Red Prince was basically only there for the extra cc, allthough I found out that stacking physical armour on him and giving him Bracus' Helm and letting him learn Overpower is incredibly powerful aswell, seeing that he can shatter enemies' physical armour in an instance, making them an easy target for chain ccing them. So that was the part about warrior being too powerful, now I wanted to move to the part where I REALLY like the idea of two different types of armour (physical and magical) and them protecting you from negative status effects, BUT on the other hand it's just way too easy to abuse this mechanic into chain ccing everything, making the fights not really challenging at all. So in the end I wanted to say: Don't get me wrong, I really REALLY like the game and I was soooo frustrated when I cleared the first act that I had to wait until the actual release of the game, but I personally found those things that I listed too powerfull."

I can only hope that Larian continues to flesh out this already rich experience and expand it. There's so much here, and so much potential. Improving upon everything I can think of from the first game, they've really done the RPG genre some justice.   I anxiously await the full release of the game, and I hope they continue to work on it well beyond."
BloodXIII,91,9,0,"April 4, 2017",Recommended,124.0,"Unbelievable. This game is amazing. I've been burned by alot of Early Access titles before but I'm really happy to say Divinty: Original Sin 2 blew me away.  In terms of gameplay the combat was just the right amount of difficult (classic difficulty) so that I had to really think about my actions and not just go on auto pilot and auto attack, but not too difficult that I had to read guides on how to beat a certain boss or encounter. The puzzles and quests were engaging enough that I didn't blow through them and forget about them, but not too complex or long that I was completing them simply for the sake of moving on.  There were a few bugs such as certain skills failing to registering but seeing as this is an Early Access game I'm not too worried (In 19 hours of gameplay skills only failed to land 3 times).   If you enjoy RPGs you'll love this game. I'm not a big fan of turnbased games, I simply get bored because I feel no connection to the characters in top down turnbased games, but, like Xcom: EW and XCom2, DoS2 seemed to make all my concerns about turn based games fade. I truly felt invested in the characters and felt like I was in the middle of the action, cheering when my glass cannon rogue pulls off an insanely reckless but satisfying attack. The game truly elicited some genuine reactions from me. I got upset when my mage stupidly pulled aggro and laughed when a massively armored knight failed to land a killing blow on me because he slipped on some blood. It engaged me better than some AAA First person RPGs did.    The story was well written for the first act, and leaves you hungry for more. The NPCs are enjoyable to interact with and the relationships they have with the PC and his party actually make sense.‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•a trader off enough he/she will stop trading. Steal from someone, you have to return the goods and get back in his good will before talking to him again.   The graphics are nice and the UI and controls aren't annoying. The AI is smart and for the most part doesn't get in your way. You just have to watch out for the sight lines of hostiles. The AI party members tend to stick very closely to the PC but if you're trying to squeeze past a narrow space they may accidentally walk into hostile sight lines triggering a fight. That's a very nity-picky problem that can easily be solved by watching out for your party better.  The freedom that this game gives you in actions and choices really is unparalleled.  I reccommend getting it now and enjoying it, but even if you wait I believe every RPG fan who wants to really feel immersion should get this game. Get it now, or get it later it doesn't matter so long as you get the game. You won't regret it."
Lametta,466,9,2,January 30,Recommended,104.9,"If you love RPGS and don't mind turnbased tactical combat this game is for you.  Larian did imrpove on Divivinity OS 1 and made this game much better. In retrospect D:OS 1 (even though i liked it) looks like a prototype/proof of concept in comparsion to this iteration.  The Good:  -Combat system is great. Especially the adition of Physical and Magical Armor. -Likeable Companions with their own story. -Better Graphics, Effects and animations (compared to D:OS1) -Overall better Combat system (but some small annoyances) -Loads Of content (Took me about 100 hours to finish the game) -Great Soundtrack -Improvements on unique playstyles (Playing undead etc)  The Bad: -The story. Even though betetr than the story of D:OS and even though it is passable it wasn't that interesting to me. Occasionally the side story fo the companion characters were much more interesting to me. -There are still bugs(e.g. Even though i choos e a different ending i got another one->won't go into detail so i won't spoil a thing) -Small annoyances in combat: Source Point system wasn't going really anywhere for me. Should have been refined.; Some enemies have annoying abilities: Cursed Wardens/Necrofire........ -At the last chapter some of the quests are knda tedious. Sometimes more is less.   Anyhow, all in all one of my most favourite RPGs of all time I think.  Let's hope Divinity 3 will be even better.  p.s.:If you liked the D:OS series you could always go back and try Divine Divinity (Diablo like 2d game) or Divinity 2 Director's Cut(Gothic/Risen kinda game with skills and dragon transformation.) Both are great games in their own rights."
Miyokari,971,9,0,"October 21, 2017",Recommended,179.0,"After finishing the game (took me around 105 hours on classic mode while playing on MP with my friend) I have to admit the game is great. Going from soundtrack, to gameplay, and the story.  Soundtrack : The music in the game is really good, the orchestral OST really makes the game, many locations and fight have fitting music for what they are. It's good to listen to the game OST even outside the game or use it in Roleplay sessions, I cannot add anything more to be honest... The soundtrack is truly great.  Gameplay : The gameplay is really good, I love turn-based combat in games and it is very refined combat from the first game. You can use envinronment in your advantage, set up poison and during the combat light it on fire, set up barrles of oil and poison ready to be destroyed and many more things which I really love about the combat. The gameplay itself is very nice, camera movement is nice and you can move it around however you want, the dialogue menu is pretty good. My only gripe was inventory but it's because it was mess thanks to my own fault (but auto sort button is pretty nice)  Story : It's good, great, awesome. The dialogues are very well written, the NPCs are ""alive"", it feels like they are real people, the talking with animals and them giving you quests is great addition to the game. Companions are also well written making it like you are adventuring actually with real people, with their own problems, agendas, interrupting talks sometimes to add something of their own. The game had as well really interesting plot twists in some places.  I can wholeheartedly recommend the game, as it become one of my favorite RPG of all time, among Baldur's Gate, Fallout and Planescape Torment"

First turn-based RPG I've played and each fight was really interesting, a bit like chess because you had to carefully use your turns or the game would kick your sweet patootie.  The biggest weakness for me was the game didn't seem to keep up with the changing context eg you may have completed a mission in a particular way and characters in the game would still be talking to you about it as if you hadn't done it yet.  This is probably because the game provides so much freedom that the devs couldn't possibly predict what every player might choose in every instance.  The final fight was a bit of a fizzer - I befriended the main villains so that they helped me fight the prime villain - so that ended him relatively quickly and then it was pretty much over - I didn't even have to kill the rest of them.  I don't really get the name of the game - the divnity bit is obvious but what was the original sin?  And how was this different from the first game which I didn't play?"

The moment I saw this was in EA, I didn't even speak the words ""Shut up and take my money!"" I just shut up and paid.  I highly recommend you do the same!  I can say without reservation, this will be one of 2017's greatest games (T:ToN is going to be a close rival, no doubt), and this will probably become a game I spend many hundreds more hours in.  (And now for an in-character moment, with my favorite Sourcerer, Ifan-ban-Mezd) Hmm, I want that ring he has but wow, it's expensive.  Ok, smile, nod, just keep talking, ""hmm, mm-hmm, that's interesting... oranges you say... uh-huh"" ""(here, put on these two rings and go 'round behind him, then nip his best stuff).""  ""He had a couple of smallish, dangerous-looking things.  Here, take 'em."" ""Yes, oh my, fascinating.  Say, why don't we have a little trade?""  I sell him back his own stuff, and trade for that ring at a pittance.  Later on, I'll kill him outright, and take back all the stuff we ""traded"".  Role-playing is fun, and profitable!  Once you master the mechanics, you can still see the 'gaminess' behind it all, but in truth, that doesn't really dimish the fun!  Learning to think strategically, then planning your next run with min/max, then tailoring each *ahem* ""event"" to your advantage, this cycle never gets old!  AND THIS IS ONLY THE ALPHA!!  The updates from the Dev during EA have brought sweeping, wonderful changes, posted even with some bit of regularity.  The videos are interesting and fun, and each update brings new elements to exploit ... test. If you have ever enjoyed any parts of any role-playing or party-scale strategy game, buy D:OS2; you won't regret it!  I'm stoked for the final release, and who knows, maybe they'll even do a full EE for this one (or maybe they'll just drop the full, voice-acted, massive epic on us all at once, in a surprise on release day; because that's just how awesome this team is!)."
Rizzit,76,17,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,242.2,"This is a 230 Hours review on Tactician.   TLDR: This game is 10/10 and deserves a spot in the RPG Hall of Fame. IT is a must buy hands down.  Pros:  - Story: Amazing Introduction that ramps up to a very good confusing mid game meltdown and ends in emotional chaos. - Gameplay: Top Notch, skills, spells, interactions, AI, everything feels smooth and fights never get boring. - Length: You dont know when the game is finally over it is soooo long and thats a good thing - Difficulty: On Tactician the game starts absolutely brutal, towards the end it unfortunately becomes easier except a few exceptions who are crazy hard again.   Cons:  - Merchants: 1 Hour waiting to get a chance of new piece of gear, no gear leveling with you, lots of unique armors or weapons capped at level 18. You can fix this though by using mods but then you get no achievements. It's not noticeable until the very end but then you notice it very hardly, to the point you go afk for 1 hour to get some new gear.  - Skills: Some skills felt lacking, especially the source skills resolve into 2-3 being better then all the others which makes you feel pidgeon holed since the enemies on harder diffs are going to spam you with the good stuff. Some skills npc's use cant be learned... also you cant make true new classes in the SDK currently which is a big downer  - Story: I understand that with so many choices it gets more complex to keep track of everything, sometimes the game does not explain or give you a chance on understanding why a character in the story would do something. One example would be Gareth if you chose to destroy everyone but side with him always, he still will be opposing you at the end while not explaining why so yeah thats unfortunately not the only story let downs.  - Thievery: only 1 pickpocket per NPC per character this is ridiculous by the astronomical prices you have to pay and the minimal gold you get for selling stuff.

Enzevil,393,14,2,June 23,Recommended,117.5,"It was about time I write a review about Divinity: Original Sin 2. Let me start off with this: it's one of the best RPGs I've ever played, and this game ended up in my personal top 10 favorite games of all time. So if you're curious about why it's so good, read on!  Divinity: Original Sin 2 starts off with the choice to create your own character, or to pick one of the Origin characters. Origin characters are full fledged characters with a personal background, but you can still choose how you want to play them. These Origin characters can be your party members throughout the game, so I found it more insteresting to have my main character be self made.  The game really has a tabletop RPG (like Dungeons & Dragons) feel to it. You can really choose how you want to play. In most games, if you want to be a Jack of all Trades, you're a master of none. In this game, you're a master of all. Because the more skills you combine, the better results you get. For example, if you choose to be a Sorcerer, you can combine water with lightning or with ice. If you first use a water spell, the ice or lightning spell will have a greater effect on the enemy. You will be well rewarded for creativity.  It also has a tactical turn-based combat system. Even movement and placement is key in combat, as well as your (combination of) skills of course. It can take a little while to get used to, but damn, the combat is awesome. It's not like other normal turn-based game, where you obviously have a best skill to use every turn. It really requires tactical thinking, and it feels really rewarding if your plan worked in combat.  The roleplaying aspect is wonderful. Not everything has to be solved my combat. There are always multiple ways to solve things, even in side quests. Not only does your background matter, but also your race. Every background and race have multiple and different roleplaying options, even for the Origin characters, who also have unique dialouge options. Oh, and yes, there are romance options in the game as well.  The goal is to become a God, literally, but the biggest accomplishment is the journey. Yes, this sounds cliche, but you will really feel this after completing this game. Are you satisfied with the choices you made, to become a God? Maybe you can't even become a God, because of the choices you made. After completing this game, it really made me think twice about the choices I made in my journey and it's really magnificent if a game can do that for me.  I'm really grateful for completing this game. It was a wonderful experience and it has so much to offer, even compared to other modern RPGs nowadays. I really recommend this game if you like RPGs or games with tactical combat. Also worth noting: Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition will launch in August and is free for all owners of this game. So even if you're waiting for the that, get this one now and you'll receive the Definitive Edition later, for free!"

Jayco√ü,262,11,0,"September 8, 2017",Recommended,406.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2  is everything the first game was but better and more. There's more options character wise (many different races), more possible outcomes of events and your decisions, more spellls, more everything!      The story is quite interesting, because this time around it seems to be more serious, dark and characters you meet (especially your companions) have their own unique storylines and motives which make you want to learn more about them, understand their POVs and interact with them (very reminiscent of the legendary Baldur's Gate games). After beating Act 1 I'm absolutely hooked and cannot help but wonder how their stories might unfold and what suprises await along the way.  UPDATE: The full game has come out and just as I expected it's bloody brilliant. Made it past the zone from early acces and there's so much to do, so much content that it's overwhelming. Best RPG ever!!!     The combat is more satisfying and rewarding than ever. It encourages creative thinking and approach to your encounters, as well as using the environment to your advantage. There's new spells and spell schools, including summoning and polymorph as well as many additions and positive changes to the old ones. The turn based battles feel a lot more fluid and engaging thanks to many mobility options characters got (grow wings and fly away, charge at your enemies or jump back - there's always an option). And of course You have the option to play the campaign with a buddy or a random person online. There's also a game master, dnd like mode coming which looks very promising. Exploration and experimenting with crafting and such is very rewarding and satisfying.    The audio is stunning, with a remarkable main theme chorus music that I cannot help but to hum to myself as  I wait for full release! Game let's you pick a favorite out of 4 instuments (oud, tamborine, bansuri and cello) the sounds of which get mixed in battle music as well as pivotal moments in your campaign, crafting a really memorable experience.     As far as graphics go they definitely feel like an improvement. Especially the character models and the armor design are gorgeous, where in the first game characters felt small and rather generic looking, with not many visual changes affecting them along the way, this time around each character and race look unique, feel big, present and meaningful in the game's world. Landscapes are beautiful and monsters you encounter look nasty (in a good way) and threatening.   Overall, I am very VERY impressed with what I experienced in the game and absolutely cannot reccommend this game enough. You can really tell the game was made with love, passion and care. (A very rare thing to find in modern games). This is, I swear the best RPG I've ever played."

Mr.Yellow,565,16,6,"January 11, 2017",Recommended,201.4,"It's short and very much unfinished thus far, and yet has utterly surprised me by being one of the most fun co-op experiences I've had in a while. While it has some issues, for Early Access it has a level of polish unheard of in most games that aren't yet fully released (and also some that are).  The systems seem well thought out, 4 player multiplayer is a massive improvement, the game looks quite lovely not even just in raw graphics but more importanly in visual design, playing as the Red Prince and picking the most Vegeta like dialogue just to see what happens is funny to me, the combat is fun and just challenging enough, these are all good points in the game's favour.  But. There is but one thing that draws me in like a moth to a flame. I have never seen such levels of freedom and sandbox design in a fantasy RPG before to the extent where there's just so much room for player dickery. For example, my friend would start conversations with NPC's like some kind of Strangey McWeirdo who actually wants to advance the plot instead of committing petty crimes for even pettier reasons (I know right?). So, while he's talking, learning story and lore, and just generally enjoying the writing I decided to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• him over for a laugh.  Even outside of combat you can sneak as long as you don't enter an NPC's Line of sight, and the NPC's sight was focused on my poor friend and not her valuables and I. Needless to say I made off with her shoes, a potion, and some fish the last of which i sent to my friend's inventory as they were still talking. One (what I can only assume to be magical) cavity search later and my friend was in prison while I was grabbing many, many, crates all of which sell for 1 gold to get my pants back after a guard took them from me the last time I got busted for petty theft.  10/10 Would have a kleptomaniac episode again."

This is fine for me but you are currently only able to access the first act. There are plenty of bugs to be worked and features not yet added out as you would expect from an early access pre-beta release. That said, though, the first act is A+++  D:OS 2 is a  turn based RPG based on gear, skill points and abilities, elements etc. A strategic game for sure. This was exactly the sort of game I was looking for and expecting as I was a huge fan of the original.  This game manages to capture what made the original great and expand on it in so many ways, with the ability depth, more grim story and great style (even when running on a potato).  There are plenty of features still to be implimented (such as local coop) as one would expect from an early access release. That said, however, you can be at ease as this is a company that has illustrated clearly in the past that they deliver big time on any promises made during the development period.

She got mad and said i couldn't get a refund. Little did she know that i already had stolen my money back from her pimp.   10/10 Would steal from pimps and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with prostitudes again.   But in all honesty the game is great, the story is much easier to follow now that it is voice acted in my personal opinion. Upon reaching Reaper's Coast i have experianced some slight problems with perfomance, but other than that, the game has been going smoothly.   The turn based combat gets spiced up by the ground effects, you can either make great use of those mechanics or they can be your doom. Saving before battle is recommended. When combat gets challenging there is no shame in reloading a save to come up with new strategies to defeat your foe. Running from combat might also be the smartest move in some situations.  The origin characters give a nice dynamic to the singleplayer game, having them in your party leads to some memorable events between you and them. When you interract with an npc they have interrest in, they will let you know, you can either allow them to do their buisness or keep them away. This will lead to you bonding with that character. If they do something you do not like, you can often have a talk about it afterwards.  The music in the game is pretty good, but sometimes there is some mishaps where a piece of music that is out place plays. Nothing gamebreaking, but you can lose a bit of your immersion. You are able to pick 1 of 4 instruments when you make a character, you will hear these instruments being played in the level up music and etc.  Persuasion checks have been a little confusing for me, sometimes when i believe i definantly should be able to pass the skill check for an option i fail and other times where i think i should have failed, i passed.

jimbobslimbob,243,10,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,128.1,"It's a turn-based isometric RPG which attempts to do what Sword Coast Legends never did: make a computer game that captured the essence of PnP, complete with campaign editor (not tried yet, since this is an EA review), GM mode and true RPG-freedom-of-choice. It is very similar to RPG's of old, like Neverwinter Nights, Baldurs Gate etc.  I have only completed Act 1 so far, since that's all that exists in the early access version, but I am hooked. The game is a joy to play. Difficult at times, yet rewarding too. It offers true freedom of choice in the way you play and create your character. It features a classless character system so you are free to do whatever you want with your character. It also features various ""origin"" characters which are kind of pre-generated characters with fleshed out backgrounds (the kind of thing you do yourself in a D&D campaign). You can choose to play one of those or alternatively make up your own and recruit them in game.  There are many ways to solve the quests in game, offering a lot of replay value. Race, ""tags"" (such as Outlaw etc.) all make NPC's treat you differently and offer various other ways to do things. The co-op gameplay (up to 4 players) has also been specifically designed with this in mind, meaning your party may not always see eye-to-eye on things. This creates the potential for some interesting RP scenarios.  Although the version I played does not yet feature a GM mode or level editor, this looks to be the icing on the cake and could significantly increase play-time. They will also offer Steam Workshop support for ""click-and-play"" modding.  Now all they need to do is offer the ability to import/export characters...  Summary Overwhelming to begin with, but once you get to grips with the game mechanics you realise just how well crafted this game is. Gorgeous graphics, wonderful sound and music, solid turn-based tactical combat and endless replay value.  Jimbo Rating: 8/10 "

Avigoat,9,15,1,August 5,Recommended,85.9,I would compare this game to the show death note where the first half is absolutley amazing but the second half is lackluster. The first half of the game in driftwood there are so many quests and things to do each quest just as interesting as the last with an immersive city that feels like its lived in but then in the second half when your're on the 3rd island idk what happened  it lost its magic with an island where all you do is pray infront of stones and there are no other quests than the one main storyline. When you reach arx after that very dissapointing island it gets a bit better there are some quests to do other than the main story and they are interesting as well. The combat through the entire game is great. Good progression to feel like your character is truly ready to become divine and if you play this game with a friend it is a great experience that for me kept me wanting to play this game till the end. This game is definitly worth the first 40 hours to immerse yourself in the world however the 3rd and 4th island of the game falls short to the rest.

Zurv,860,7,0,"October 16, 2017",Recommended,153.7,"This game is fantastic. One of the best RPGs I‚Äôve played.  Larian created a rich and living world to play in. The story (unlike the DOS1) is good with twists and turns. There are tons of side quest and normally multi ways to finish them. (yes, murdering everyone is an option‚Ä¶ but then you might miss out on more story/exp.) The interaction of ‚Äúsystems‚Äù they setup, from how elements react with other elements/spells to actions in the world people see you do. It makes for great combat and a lot of creative way how to deal with enemy/issues. I did play the first game (Divinity Original Sin) so I had an idea of how the game worked. (side note, there is no reason to play the first game. While great, it task soooo long to get going that many players will bounce off it.) I didn‚Äôt find the game or it‚Äôs systems confusing because of that.. maybe? Do not expect the game to tell you explicitly how to play. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù that you need to just work it out yourself. It will subttlely tell you how to play via the interface. My advice is take it slow. This is one of those games that you search everyone, read everything, talk to everyone. ÔÅä Save a lot. (f5 key) Not because it is hard, but you might change to change how some event is going once you see what is happening. Honestly my biggest ‚Äúproblem‚Äù with the game is a massive fear that I‚Äôm going to miss something. (which you can totally do.. it is very easy.) Did I miss some book? I did not ask the right question? Did I have a skill to low and missed seeing some hidden item/switch/etc‚Ä¶ argh! That said, there is so much here it isn‚Äôt a big deal to miss some side stuff. But.. but.. I want to see it all.. so.. there is some stress there. Getting to the last big area was very stressful for me as I started to feel overwhilemd  The quest log isn‚Äôt super great. It isn‚Äôt always clear what the next steps are‚Ä¶ but in the defense of the game it really isn‚Äôt a check list of this but more a log of what you are doing. (but it would still be nice if they said if X quest is going to end of it leave area Y or if it will keep going.)  Totally get this magical game, but do expect to bump into a learning curve if you‚Äôve not play RPGs before. (of course there is an ‚Äúexplorer‚Äù (or something like that) which might be a way to get into the game a little ez‚Äôr.) There is co-op in the game too.. but I personally don‚Äôt see how that would be fun. Each person in your party is a part of your strategy. Well, at least play with someone you know and not a rando. )  Most people will restart the game after a few hours after they get an idea how the party they want and rolls/skills they want. But don‚Äôt super stress it. After you leave the first island you‚Äôll be able to re-roll all you people skills/stats/etc (and as any times as you want.. free. The game isn‚Äôt setup to screw you over if you made a bad choice.  "

Xilil,57,14,0,"September 16, 2016",Recommended,127.9,"Everything that made Original Sin 1 is in here, plus loads of extras that add to the experience.  Character development now allows for much more flexibility. In OS1 it was pretty hard to make some original combos like a battlemage because of the way skills and attributes worked. Now it feels like characters are much more customizable to whatever crazy combination you want to have.  The graphics are also a huge improvement. The PBR-rendering makes everything look stunning while preserving the nice aesthetics of the first game.  The single player Act that is available to Early Acces offers a lot of content. The replayability is also quite high. There are quite a lot of ways to complete your goals, which will make every playthrough a bit different.   The only problem that I think this sequel still has, is that sometimes it's hard to find the content for your level. Because of this you sometimes end up just running around looking for those level 4's you still need to kill to level up.   I thought PvP was going to be kind of nice, but that is quite the understatement. The PvP is one of the best PvP experiences I had in a long time. There's so much depth to it, while still keeping it fun. This is were the additions in combat from Original Sin 1 really show their beauty with Source skills and tons of new surface combo's like blessed fire. I just hope there will be a matchmaking system eventually because the server browser isn't that good in my opinion. People try to put up private matches in public, so everytime someone joins they instantly kick them.  Which brings me to my last complaint, which is that the game visibility of single player is the same as the visibility of multiplayer. This means that if you want to play single player, and right after that create an arena lobby, you have to change the setting every single time.  In conclusion I think it still has its flaws which is normal ofcourse, but at its current state it is already a beautiful and fun game."

Sgt. McSergeantface,85,9,1,July 4,Recommended,237.0,"Why exactly you are reading reviews for Divinity: Original Sin 2? I doubt you were just browsing store. You were looking for RPG, don‚Äôt you? Or maybe you‚Äôve heard somewhere about this phenomenal game and just checking out. Or maybe you don‚Äôt actually trust this unstoppable hype train, do you?      TL; DR. Buy. Play. Replay. Get Enhanced for free. Replay.     Well, every praised thing you might have heard about this outstanding game is 100% true. My life is now divided into ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù Divinity: Original Sin 2.   Larian Studios - creators of Divinity - is company of people, that actually works with players and for players. I will remind you, it is an indie project financed on a crowdfunding platform. Game has inherited all the best parts from previous instance. However, it is an understatement to tell that OS2 improved things. Sequel has added so much more, it has surpassed every existing game and doubled, tripled the level of today‚Äôs RPGs, adding everything we didn‚Äôt dare to dream about.   We want to choose playable races! - Ok, here‚Äôs four. And you can make a playable undead character. We want more companions! - Fine. And they are living humans - play with three of your friends.   We want more magic and perks! - Here 4 more skill schools and mix them up to unlock more perks. We want to make love to our party members! - No problem. You also can punch ‚Äòem in a face anytime. We want personal quests! - Welcome playable characters with prewritten origins and their own story arc. We want more stories! - Here‚Äôs Game Master mode and dedicated modding support.   Everyone knows, how much time it takes sometimes to create your character: skills, abilities, talents, etc. Eventually it took me twice as much, because I just couldn‚Äôt stop admiring visual design of characters, feasting my eyes while scrolling different races and skill presets, to see as character‚Äôs model switches his looks. In addition to looks and technical part of your avatar, there are two notable things in character creation. First, if you build your own character (not pre-created), you can add some personality traits, which together with race will reflect on your social interactions (i.e. dialog options). Second, choose one of four musical instruments - game‚Äôs musical score will dynamically change leading instrument, when your character does something awesome. Imagine epic cello or bansuri solo when your hero is unleashing some hell on pity enemies! More to this: do not bother with perfect build, try fresh ideas, experiments and bold choices - Divinity will allow you to change your specs midgame numerous times if you think you‚Äôve messed up.   Combat system maybe the one thing that has changed heavily in sequel, a lot of things were reconsidered. For me personally it was hard to get used to changes right after first game, but in hours I‚Äôve found it even more satisfying. However, keep in mind that straightforward face punching still not the option. Tactics has moved into third dimension - do not underestimate high ground. And of course, don‚Äôt forget to utilize everything you can reach, that‚Äôs including you pockets and your surroundings. Found yourself standing fenced in a fire - use water barrel to extinguish it or bless fire and stand your fight in cleansing flames. Got bullied by a brute - teleport yourself out, or teleport enemy‚Äôs sorry‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•on lava. Some of most efficient tactics are those that not first come to mind.   Plot isn‚Äôt connected to Original Sin. Sequel is provided with its own overarching narrative and several personal story arcs of origin characters (which also serve as companions) and particular factions. Everything is interconnected in some complicated manner, it was the reason of bugs and some general frustration, because one path leads to impasse on other story thread (fixed by further patching). However, game doesn‚Äôt hold your hand and never questions your approach to advance the story. E.g., first thing you are tasked with after tutorial section - get out of concentration camp, and then you can look for someone to help you with this, help others for info on how to get out, murder your way out, lie your way out, or fly away, if you have the ability, without even meeting anyone. Plot progression is not just 3-4 options, but absolutely non-linear. Basically, you can roam where the wind blows the whole game, you will always find yourself on a right path.   World of Rivellon has changed. At first, after whole shiny hunky-dory previous game, it was tough to find yourself in a place that is harsh, cruel and mean as Wild West. People will lie to you, use you, and you absolutely will find yourself in a situation, where the line between good and evil is blurred into wide grey area, where all alignments are subjective. Look, I have lost the faith in what I had been doing halfway through and have to reconsider my view on things - it is impressive storytelling for a video game.   Music in game is kept on astonishing level, with memorable scores and even few actual songs, that are closely tied to game‚Äôs narrative. Soundtrack is notably adaptative to surroundings and players interactions. Thousands of lines of dialogs were voiced perfectly, with distinct accents and proper manners respective to in-game personalities. Surprising addition is in-game Narrator, that makes you journey more immersive and closer to tabletop gaming. Narrator‚Äôs commentary on things are so neat and detailed, you can basically enjoy your ride with eyes closed.   Persuasion, as a vital part in RPG gameplay, has changed. Creators ditched that awkward ‚Äúrock, paper, scissors‚Äù minigame, though there is no any kind of randomizer behind now. However, success not solely depends on your persuasion skill level: very neat thing is involving physical attributes into check, like trying to reason with someone adds your intelligence bonus, while intimidating is much easier with high strength.   Most of the game earlier criticism was based on overabundance of bugs, inconsistencies and even script deadlocks. However, Larian never stopped patching and fixing and up all holes and mistakes, therefore every month after release players received long lists of patch notes. As for now most of things are shiny, polished and perfectly balanced. Moreso, Larian is readying an Enhanced Edition for release, where everything is refined and glossy, and with reworked third and fourth chapters of the story, which got their fair share of judgement from players. No point of waiting for release, as owners of current version will receive a new one.   Divinity OS2 requires your time and energy investment. There is so much in this phenomenal game, you are not able to treat it as a casual walk in a park. Managing characters party, inventory and crafting, diving deep into each story, heck, even most of the important combat encounters are challenging and will take a lot more time that you think, with all the tactical possibilities. However, if you are ready to enter immense world of fantasy, magic, political intrigue, adventure, love and betrayal - there is no better way than playing Divinity: Original Sin 2."

A Catgirl is Fine Too,394,20,2,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,108.5,"The first Original Sin game was my favorite title of 2014, and I have been impatiently waiting for the sequel from the moment I finished it. I am pleased to report that it has been well worth the wait. Larian Studios have a fundamental understanding of what makes a good sequel: Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps the things that made the original great, and builds on the areas that were lacking.   The art design is even more stunning than before, and the one act currently available is packed with things to do. I've already found numerous clever ways to solve both major and minor quests. Combat, arguably the most important aspect of the game, has remained largely the same, with the addition of new mechanics such as height and cursed surfaces to keep things fresh. The plot in the first game was one of my few complaints, as it felt generic and poorly paced in places. However, in Original Sin 2 I find myself much more intrigued and very much like what I have seen of the story so far. Although the game is still in early access as I write this, it already feels like a straight upgrade from Original Sin 1.  As far as criticism goes, the music currently feels slightly lackluster, although being able to choose a special instrument to play during climactic moments is a novel idea. One of my complaints from the first game was that by the end of it, combat had begun to feel tedious. As I said, combat is still fundamentally the same, but I have yet to explore all the new features and I hope they keep combat exciting across my multiple inevitable playthroughs.   Of course, as an early access title, bugs and glitches come with the territory, but I have yet to experience a game-breaking one. I am currently playing on ultra on a moderately powerful laptop, and performance has been stable, with an average FPS of 60-65.   In conclusion, did you like Divinity: Original Sin? If yes, you'll love this one too. If for some reason you didn't, you're not going to find a completely new experience here, although it might have fixed what you disliked. If you're new to the franchise, I'd always suggest buying the finished first game over the unfinished early access game, but if you're a fan of turn-based RPGs you'll likely get more than your money's worth. I have a huge amount of respect for Larian Studios and I don't doubt for a second that Divinity: Original Sin 2 will only get better from here. "
axfelix,267,13,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,113.0,"Man, it's so good. They took what was already the most flexible, fun, and modern CRPG out there and made the engine even more expansive and the game weirder and more interesting.  I would actually recommend playing the first one first if you haven't; it's not really needed for plot reasons (there are a few returning characters but nothing major) but it's a little easier to get a handle on, hardly any less impressive, and in the meantime this sequel could probably still use another few months of polish patches. It's hardly anything to hold against it given the scope, and I didn't hit a single bug I'd consider really significant, but the farther you get into the game the more broken the quest flags start to feel and the more minor continuity issues the dialogue starts to have and the more combat balance starts to break.

Dralek,315,6,1,"October 6, 2017",Recommended,294.2,"This game is amazing.  I can't stop playing it.  Let's start out with the first thing you do in the game; character customization.  You have 4 races to choose from, each with their own unique traits, backstory, and affect how everyone treats you.  Lizards can dig without a shovel, Dwarves can crawl into small spaces nobody else can, Elves can eat body parts to learn the memories of the fallen (sometimes gaining skills in the process), and so forth.  You've got a lot of choices for playstyles as well, and it's not set in stone.  You could start off the game as a wizard, then transition into a battlemage who charges into the fray, then unleashes spells that require proximity.  Then, you've got the Tags.  Basically, they let you set up your own backstory, as well as giving additional dialogue options when the time is right.  Mystics can sometimes talk to the gods, whilst Barbarians want a *simple* solution to many problems.  But the best is yet to come...  and it's something that I'm a bit of a sucker for.  Music.  You can set the lead instrument on the soundtrack.  It's only four instruments, and the one you choose will be, well, the prominent instrument throughout the soundtrack.  Not a fan of character customization?  That's fine, you can select an Origin character.  These guys normally would be optional party members if you were to create your own character, but you can also play as them for your main character.  The choices are really interesting too; a lizard who cavorted with demons and got exiled, wanting to reclaim his empire; or a human who is a host of all kinds of spirits while a demon is trying to wrest control of her body.  They all have pre-set tags, but you can choose the class they start with.  Now for the gameplay.  Out of battle, stuff is simple; everything is performed from your clicking (duh).  However, even outside of combat your skills are still tested.  Persuasion can be a way to get out of a fight, or get more information out of someone, bartering lowers prices for you.  You can also steal stuff too, but be warned if you played the first game; the stealing has been revamped by quite a lot.  You can no longer just walk into someone's house, close the door and sneak about, stealing everything that isn't bolted down.  The moment you take something, no matter if you're sneaking or not, the townsfolk will become suspicious and try to search you.  Of course, there's ways to make sure they don't succeed, but I'll leave that since a lot of this game is about finding your own playstyle.  The combat is not really changed by much from the first game, but many more complexities have been added.  Surfaces play a crucial role to a mage just like before, however they have many more options due to the magic trees.  Water can be frozen, electrified, or turned into steam which can also be electrified.  Bless can actually turn surfaces, well, blessed, healing characters who travel through it.  (That includes everyone, so make sure blessed surfaces can't be accessed by the enemy.)  However, there is also Cursed surfaces, which carry extra effects to them.  Necrofire can't be put out by normal water, Cursed Oil can go off on MOVEMENT, and so forth.  Armor is no longer a stat that simply decreases damage received, it is instead its own bar.  This bar is crucial to manage, as it stops status effects.  Think of it as a shield; as long as you have a shield up, you can't be affected by the status of a surface your character may be standing on, with certain exceptions as Oil that slows you down.  As a general rule of thumb however, the game's combat is very challenging.  There really isn't many fights that have ""cannon fodder"" enemies; everyone is dangerous and they all know how to take advantage of the same things you do.  Be careful about that water you're standing on, for that mage on higher ground likely might have an electric spell he could cast, if your magic armor is down, and stun you.  My recommendation?  This game deserves all the praise that it's got and more.  The only real complaint I have is with the camera control, but that's mainly due to my mouse having issues with some games not registering the middle mouse click.  Plus, in battle you can get a top-down view if there's too many obstacles."

Dogg,196,6,0,"November 18, 2017",Recommended,110.3,"**spoiler free**  What a fantastic journey. Every once in a while, you get incredibly hyped for that next game that's about to come out... and every so often, that very game delivers on the hype. This game ultimately did that for me, and I'm almost sad that the journey is now over (unless I start another new game). Starting each category at 10 points.   Visuals: starting at +10 ================ The game's graphics look fantastic. There is a vast amount of polished detail in each and every environment. The developers didn't leave anything out. Even areas you may only explore once, if only for a couple of minutes, got all the same polished details as areas that you'll be spending hours upon hours inside of. Brilliant, long, hard work went into sewing the fields of this game's visuals, and the developers are reaping the fantastic benefits of that hard work. Well done.  + No real cons here. I never had any screen tearing and rarely saw any seams throughout the world.  Final score: 10/10    Sound/Music: +10 ============= For anyone who has read my past reviews, you'll know I use the word ""weight"" a lot when it comes to sound effects. This ""weight"" means that for each and every major sound effect in the game, there should typically be some kind of ""impact"" behind them. It doesn't have to be a big ""boom"" for that to work. It can be the sounds of butterfly wings flapping in the wind (which would be incredibly hard to hear), or it can be a loud thunderbolt. Either way, whichever object or environment a sound effect has been stuck in/onto, it has to have a strong feeling behind it. This is not easy to explain, but let's just say that Divinity Original Sin 2 pulls it off extremely well.  + All abilities sound effects, even ones that are as simple as throwing a dagger, feel heavy. There is strength behind them. No ability is left out, nothing is in the ""filler"" category. Excellent.  + Music appears to be orchestra, and it's great. Battle music pumps you up. ""Majestic"" music calms you down, and provides a sense of relief behind it. It all sounds fantastic.  + Pre-final battle music setup is excellent (only those who've played the game will understand).  + Great voice work across all characters, both major and minor.  Final score: 10/10    Performance: +10 ============= Overall, the game runs well.   + When everything is working, it performs at 60 FPS, constantly.  +/- Long long load times between regions. I mark this as neither a plus or a minus due to the fact that once you're loaded in, there are no load times whatsoever. The game loads everything upon entry (this is why is takes so long).  - Bugs bugs and more bugs. Nothing game breaking fortunately. A common theme when it comes to Larian Studios games. The good news is, most bugs are extremely minor. Quest bugs WILL be contracted, inhibiting you from actually completing a quest. Other quest related bugs include 1) actually completing a quest, but it never leaving your quest log. 2) you have option A and option B to choose from. You chose option A, but the game will say you chose option B. -1  - Certain battles have frustrating situations where a turn will not end immediately, forcing you to wait for up to 5-10 minutes at a time for each turn to finally end (even though nothing is happening). This will hopefully be patched in the near future. It was not patched in this playthrough. -1  - Game will crash every now and then. -1  - Strange lag issues in regards to certain spells (such as blood storm). These lag issues will persist until the specific spell (or spells) animations have completely ended, sometimes several turns after being cast. -1  Final score: 6/10   Story: +10 ======== You are a source wielder. You've been captured and you're about to sent to what would closely resemble a ""prison island"" to serve out your remaining days. It's time to escape! This is where the adventure begins.  + Premade characters all have an actual personality that you will love or hate. It will slowly be fleshed out as the story progresses, whether for better or for worse. Whichever character you pick (or don't pick, you can make your own too) will still have their main story attached, but you get to make a plethora of extra decisions behind them that will ultimately influence their endgame personality. So don't be afraid to pick the premades (you can also edit their classes and appearances).  + Relevant in-game choices that will affect the endings.  + Special endings for certain characters are available.  - Some scenes would have a far greater impact if it wasn't simply reading text. A few animations here and there wouldn't hurt, especially behind big scenes (that would normally be a cutscene vs an interactable scene). -1  Final score: 9/10    Gameplay: +10 =========== Gameplay hinges upon building your starting character with either physical, magical, or ranged damage types (ranged being both physical and magical, depending on if you're an archer or a mage). You'll run around and collect lots of loot, sell the loot, buy better loot; craft items, scrolls, and potions; learn a vast amount of abilities and even craft secret ""hidden"" abilities; there is plenty to do here, and you will be busy, all while having fun (hopefully).  + Respec any time once you hit Act 2, for free. This will actually probably enrage some players, because they want to feel the weight of locking in their choice of permenant abilities (i.e. Diablo 2). Respecing for me on the other hand was the greatest thing to ever happen in this game. I started as a Battlemage, switched to a full time mage, and then later switched to a mostly full-timer tank/DPS with certain mage support abilities attached. I had another character start as a full healer and supporter, who later stayed as a full healer supporter, but also had fire and ice abilities to help in combat, if they couldn't do anything else. You can experiment to your heart's delight. So get past Act 1, then indulge in the world of change!  + You can play as a skeleton, with facial hair.  + Various unique abilities for each race are well implemented and can provide extra benefits to playing a certain class with a certain race (such as a thief/assassin with an undead, due to getting a free skeleton key to unlock any chest provided you have high enough Thievery skill. No need to buy lockpicks!)  + Crowd control in this game is just as fantastic as it was in the first game, with a vast amount of new CC abilities (like sleeping).  + The addition of Armor and Magic Armor is also fantastic, providing you with protection against CC abilities of both the physical and magical aspects until that chosen armor is depleted (unless you have Glass Cannon).  + Playing with friends is a lot of fun.  +/- Some talents in the game feel wholly useless (Demon and Ice King), while others feel overpowered. I mark this as plus or minus simply because you can respec at any given time. It would only benefit to take certain ""less useful"" talents to quick specific areas of the game, then respec again back to whatever you were originally with. That being said...  - I played the game on Tactician mode (which is basically hard mode) and having a slightly higher fire resistance or slightly lower ice resistance never really made that big of a difference. The enemies in this mode having such incredibly strong physical or magical abilities would typically negate your armor too too quickly, and 15% out of 100% is just not very helpful. Leadership was a much better option, and also freed up the ""wasted"" talent points. These less useful abilites are what you would call ""filler"". -1  Final score: 9/10    Overall: 8.8/10 (44/50 = 0.88) ===================== A well delivered fine wine that will age almost indefinitely for days to come. Will sip on again. Great job to the developers."

DoubleP2k,283,6,0,"December 12, 2016",Recommended,153.7,"TL;DR: The turn based combat is epic in ways I wouldn't have considered possible (prior to the original game). On that note, play the first game first, it's great, and if you like it then come to this one. The two big notes I have about this game are that it's dumb you can freely respec, and tactician mode is a major dissapointment compared to tactician mode in the first game. It's predominantly just an enemy stat buff (+50% to damage, vitality, and armor) and that's about it. It's most just artificial difficulty for if you played the game through a few times and want to have it challenge you again.  Overall I like it a lot, but I admit I don't quite love it like I did the first game."

They brought out a update which was a entirely new game with voice acting, new camera controls, new missions, more items/skills, everything changed so i played it and it was one of the best games i had played, i bought this on release and held off for a few days to finish the first game.. I tried the arena mode out and it is actually really fun! I then proceeded to the campaign with a friend of mine and was overwhelmed with the character screen for a alpha game.. I created a elf Necromancer.. I will eat everybody's corpse and steal their souls... That is what i love about this game, you can kill every single person in the game and still complete the story.. Well this game you (kind of) tell your own story, each race has it's own dialogue, each trait has it's own dialogue (bandit,rogue,scholar, that kind of stuff) and already for a alpha game seems almost finished! The story only has one act at the moment which i am SUPER BUMMED about but again.. It's alpha. Oh by the way..... There is a game master mode... Yup, you heard, DUNGEON MASTER!

Marcus Butthurticus,"1,198",8,0,May 2,Recommended,170.9,"This game is really a master piece in the RPG genre in modern times.  Simply put it is a charming game with wonderful enviroment in a world that is deeper than one might think. It takes silly bit to far at times but never as far as lets say Borderlands 2 did which to me, ruined the whole game. Original Sin 2 is both a silly and grim story. The turnbased combat is excellent and it works so well with others. Prepare for a lot of backstabs if you play with nasty people! And prepare for twists.   There is not a better multiplayer RPG this side of Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2. The builds you can do are plenty and races bring their own special abilities, especially Elf and Undead have some unique mechanics, like eating body parts to gain memories of the dead and even abilities at times or Undead....being Undead.   There is at times some weird things. Like AI going nuts and doing not so optimal things or certain questlines not working correctly. RPGs with long questlines that the player sometimes managed to screw up by circumventing things by being cheesy is a classic thing in RPGs, The more advanced endings and options for a questline, the more keen to it breaking it is.   Beside these problems, Original Sin 2 is a excellent game, with nice character building, this is probably one of the strongest parts of the game! Just going nuts when it comes to builds. NPCs that are not so bad, Interesting characters and a developed world. Only thing I would want is a longer end act. The last settlement you are in could been a bit bigger to symbolize the size of it. For the next  game I hope to more of the same, even if it has to be crazy AI and questlines that is not always triggered in the correct way. I hope to see a Original Sin 3 in the coming years.  EDIT: I must point out that the issues could all stem from us taking breaks over a month at times which could off have broken things between patches. The game usually works very well otherwise."
Fork_Q2,"1,616",8,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,215.2,"Amazing and extremely reactive RPG. Many ways to discover new quests, and many more ways to solve them, rewards creativity and thinking outside the box. Immersive and interesting plot, world might be bright and colourful, but the plot and side-quest can be extremely dark, touching on topics like genocide and child murder. On the downside, there are some balancing issues, UI could be much improved, a fair bit of wrong or placeholder text and content showing up later in the game, and a few bugs. But otherwise a rewarding experience that I want to immidately return to again, after beating for the first time. And I rarely play the same game more than once."
Dhr. Bernard,413,21,20,"September 16, 2016",Recommended,18.7,"Tbh not owning this game is the original sin  All nonsense aside though, I really like this game.  Although there is only one chapter available at this time, there is a big island to explore with hidden secrets like treasure and hidden caves. The combat is deep and has a nice tactical twist to it and definitely feels more smooth compared to the first game.  However, before buying this, keep in mind that this game is still in early access for at least half a year. So there is no voice acting yet, some sound effects will be missing, you might encounter quite a few bugs and glitches and most important of all, there is only one chapter available at this time (you still get 8-15 hours of gameplay from this, plus there is an online pvp arena).  If you don't mind the lack of content and if you are a fan of a bit more slow-paced rpg, this game is definitely something for you."

It's not an overly-complex isometric RPG like Baldur's Gate but it achieves the same level of good storytelling and flexible paths of completion.  This game truly demonstrates the next generation of top-down RPG's and you're missing out until you've finished this.  It will take you hours just to get out of Fort Joy, and by that time you'll think the game is half over, but there is still so, so much more content after.  10/10, its just too damn good.

Game is smooth as soft butter. Runs great, plays great.  For developers: Change the frequency of cat meows. OMG irritating with surround sound every 10 secs hearing the freaken cat.  For players: Buy it early. I never bought a game early on steam. I loved the first one, watched some youtube videos on the development of the second and decided to buy early to support the team.

TheokolesTW,97,12,3,"September 16, 2016",Recommended,76.9,"The worst aspect of playing this in Early Access is that even though you're getting to play the game - you still have to wait until they release the final, finished version.  It's going to be tough to wait it out. Because now I know just how good it will be.  The game plays much like the first - just better. It's design, the more polished and tweaked systems. I've been playing with a friend who is new to the series and honestly I laugh when I tell him about some of the systems in place.  ""Yeah so you can teleport that bad guy and drop him on that bad guy and they'll both get hurt.""  Or  ""Right, did you pick up that corpse's leg? Oh, well pick it up and we'll take it to an Elf so they can eat and tell us where to go next.""  Or  ""I'm not sure what to do, we might want to talk to that cat.""  Lol.  Playing this game by yourself is great - playing with another person, or better in a larger group... man this game is gold.   I've still got a lot of play left in this game - but I dread finishing it and having to wait for the rest. So I'm taking my time. If I can spend a couple of extra hours where someone else would take only 1 I'll be a happy bunny.  Anyways, if you like this sort of game (and honestly who wouldn't?) do yourself a favour and pick this up for you and a friend. Just remember to come into it with the knowledge you're going to have to wait until next year for the full thing."

LugdunonTG,744,16,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,91.7,I loved Divinity: Original Sin both in Co-op and Single player. The first time I played it was that same feeling in D&D when you realise you can do nearly anything. Divinity: Original Sin 2 carries on this legacy incredibly well already considering it's early state. In the short time I've played I met a host of weird and interesting characters. Stumbled upon various quests that aren't just in plain site.  This is the way I love my RPG's this game rewards you for exploring and taking risks. Just because the odds seem against you does not mean they are as long as you use the environment to your advantage. Blood puddles on the floor can become electrified to shock people on them. You can contaminate them to poison people and use fire to cause poison to combust. It's a wonderful game that I feel like will improve on the original in every way once it's finished. The early version does contain bugs and is obviously missing many aspects but if you wanna just mess around with builds or the new PvP modes then now is as good a time to jump in as any as long as you realise its not fully fleshed out YET. High recommendation from me for all RPG fans.   https://youtu.be/LxvdYIl1IMI  Here's some Gameplay if you wish to see more and I may consider making this a series with enough interest otherwise I check back every few updates.

It's so much more enjoyable, but frustrating at the same time. Learn to love fort joy, as you'll be restarting many times. It took me good ~30 groups to find someone to finish the game with. Thankfully (and sadly) first act is the best made one, and there's a lot to do there.

Even 300+ hours in I found combat enjoyable, each fight a challenge, with a chance to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up. There are some rather clever mechanics to learn and abuse, unique skills to master, builds to optimize and routes to find.   The game is well worth your money and time, despite it's shortcomings.   Speaking of which... Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of things wrong with the game. From expected (but not liked) bugs and glitches - on my last playthrough we had at least 3 bugged quests, a bunch of issues with stuck characters and desyncs - to more serious problems.   Story is passable at best. It will not keep you awake or amaze you in the end. Sidequests are often more engaging than the main plot line.   Armor system is very restricting for the most of the game, especially on the higher difficulties. It pretty much forces you in to using only physical or magical (typically physical) damage, as you need to strip the armor before controls can be used, and controls are mandatory for the most of the game. Yes, sure eventually you can get one spell room clearing mages, but that's late game, and that's not what you will be doing most of the time. Arguably mages are gimped up to level 12, which is a good half of the game. Once again, this is highest difficulty level, but this is where it gets fun.   There is also serious lack of skills, or variety, to be precise. It's fine for first game, but later you start to notice it more. And so many skills are very situational, or subpar, so you generally use ~5 constantly and a few for utility. It's specially notable between melee classes, as a rogue, knight(2h weapons), warrior(sword and board) and metamorph will use the same warfare skills, as they are core to being a melee, and not their ""subclass"" variations. There are also crafted skills, combining 2 schools, but combinations are between magical and physical schools, meaning you will rarely even see them.   There is very little to do outside of combat, except preparing for combat or picking up quests before you go fight stuff for the quests. A bit lacking from a cRPG.   Several of the systems feel unfinished, lacking purpose. Crafting seems like a huge part of the game initially, but you only really craft runes and lockpicks. Potions, scrolls, food and grenades quickly become useless, even healing potions are disappointing in the endgame. Scrolls hold up the longest, but not the offensive one, only the ones that can remove status effects. NPC attitude value is a glorified discount program.   AI ""cheats"" a lot. No one will suspect you as an undead (or having the zombie trait) outside of combat, but once initiated, get ready to receive all the healing spells. And they will forget it immediately after. Enemies will know where exactly to move, to avoid a minefield of line of sigh obstacles and smoke blockers, just to get that single possible shot on their turn.   But all of that said, I still enjoyed the hell out of my time with the game. Sure, maybe the abysmal state of PC gaming this year and lack of good RPG games in general is partially to blame, but I think there's more to it.

Everything feels flued. The amount of dialouge options makes my mouth water. reading the amazing parts of lore and dialouge. The voice acting is TOP notch, the narator is a perfect addition. I can't find annything bad about this. I have craved for a amazing crpg for years. Don't get me wrong, i love tyranny, Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland, Shadowrun, torment, etc. and i stil play the infinity engine games.  But by the gods, this game just blew them out of the water. From soundtrack to gameplay, this game is a masterpiece.  And in my opinion stands tall allongside the great Crpg's of old.

Cognitohazard,340,5,0,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,221.6,"Story: It would appear from the start that this game‚Äôs plot is about the protagonist, being one of the ‚ÄúGodwokens‚Äù, ascending to divinity. Sounds familiar, doesn‚Äôt it? Let me remind you then, in the first divinity game Divine Divinity, you play as one of the three ‚ÄúMarked Ones‚Äù, and eventually become the Divine. In the Baldur‚Äôs Gate saga, you play as one of the ‚ÄúBhaalspawn‚Äù, and can eventually ascend to divinity. So, yeah, the story seems pretty clich√© as first. But as you progress through the game, you will find that there‚Äôs more to it, and eventually I realized that the story is actually pretty good. Maybe not fantastic, but it‚Äôs interesting enough for me to enjoy, and the delivery is on point.  Except for that massive info dump at the end of the game, that's just bad.  I‚Äôd give it a 8/10.  Writing: Tbh good story and good writing are two things that I never expect from Larian Studio, since they‚Äôve produced far too many games with mediocre story and bland, sometimes downright terrible writing (looking at you Beyond Divinity). But this time they proved me wrong. Because the writing in DOS2 is actually really well done. They changed their writing style from trying hard to be funny to having a more serious tone, avoiding cheesy dialogues like the ones in DOS1, and introduced more narrating which in my opinion is a step in the right direction. This, coupled with the absolutely phenomenal voice acting, made every dialogue in this game thoroughly enjoyable. I give it a 8.5/10.  Gameplay: Now this is where this game really shines. For far too long CRPG means bad gameplay, and it‚Äôs sad but true (with only few exceptions), until DOS1 came out. DOS1, albeit being a great game, has many flaws and untapped potentials. DOS2, having improved from DOS1 in almost every aspect, has the most enjoyable gameplay I‚Äôve ever had in a CRPG. It has the class building of Arcanum, the tactical combat of Fallout1/2 and Shadowrun, and the interactivity of Ultima. The game encourages player‚Äôs creativity and thinking out of the box, which results in many ‚Äúholy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•you can do this?‚Äù moments and it‚Äôs rewarding af when you manage to pull off some awesome trick. There‚Äôs always multiple approach toward a single quest, providing tons of freedom. For example there‚Äôs 8 ways to escape Fort Joy alone. 1, the kill everyone approach. 2, use teleportation in Gawin‚Äôs quest. 3, Also in Gawin‚Äôs quest, don‚Äôt teleport and go down the tree trunk and into the prison through the hole instead. 4, use teleportation at the end of the path with trees with red leaves. 5, go to the prison through the fire slug cave and sneak out/ fight all the way to the gate. 6, use teleportation to teleport to the 2nd floor of Fort Joy and sneak out/ fight. 7, use teleportation to teleport to the 2nd floor of Fort Joy and move some barrels and boxes to reveal a balcony from which you can escape. 8, deliberately get caught to be sent to prison and sneak out/ fight. Overall the gameplay feels really polished and rewarding, a solid 10/10 for me.  Music: The composer of other Divinity games‚Äô soundtrack, Kirill Pokrovsky, passed away in 2015. R.I.P. Kirill. That‚Äôs the main reason I didn‚Äôt expect much from DOS2‚Äôs soundtrack because Kirill had set the bar way too high. But after finishing the game, I have to say that Borislav Slavov (the new composer) did a really good job. The music starts to get really good after finishing Act 1. Though Kirill‚Äôs music‚Äôs uniqueness can‚Äôt be replicated, I‚Äôm more than satisfied by Borislav‚Äôs own unique music. 9/10.  Visual:  Well, not something that matters much in a CRPG, but I would be lying if I say I don‚Äôt appreciate a good visual. And the graphic in this game is great. For a CRPG anyway. 9/10.  I give DOS2 a solid overall score of 9.5/10, it‚Äôs my personal best RPG that‚Äôs published in the past 5 years, and definitely one of the best RPGs of all time. If you loved games like Baldur‚Äôs Gate, Arcanum or Ultima, this game is for you. Some gripes: The game is currently filled with bugs. (10/06/2017) The game gets more and more buggy as you progress through the game. None of the bugs I encountered are game-breaking, but can be bothering nonetheless. And the game feels rushed toward the end, especially in Act 4. I enjoyed Act 4 just as much as I enjoyed other Acts, and the content isn‚Äôt inferior, but there are lots of issues that should have been solved in game testing, such as repeating dialogue, ridiculous level design, and messy quest triggers. And then there‚Äôs some inconsistencies in the companions‚Äô writing that can be quite confusing too. Despite these problems I still clocked 140 hours in a single playthrough, so I can assure you that, most probably, these problems won‚Äôt hinder your enjoyment of the game."

Finjas,100,5,0,"October 8, 2017",Recommended,87.3,"When I finished the first Original Sin, I thought that was the highest point for Larian Studios. It had everything great about oldschool RPGs and more, it was inventive in both gameplay mechanics and story. It had an interesting world to explore. Could they possibly top that?  Divinity OS2 shows how hard they worked for it. It's a huge improvement on something that was already great.  The core basically didn't change all that much. Game mecahinics are the same, although reworked a lot: balance is much better. The inclusion of Physical and Magic armour makes it so much simplier (not easier!) to plan out your tactics in battle. Writing has changed too. It's now trying to be something like the game master narrates the whole thing to you instead of letting you expierence everything in first person. The change may seem dubious, but it works here for one simple reason - D:OS 2 feels like a tabletop RPG all through. The changes are subtle, but they do a lot. The First game was a solid CRPG expierence. This one, though, because of the changes, -- the writing, the mechanics, co-op, -- this is something more. It's no longer just a CRPG. The trailer didn't lie! No matter how you choose to play, you'll expierence endless layers of pen and paper RPG depth! So much potential for roleplaying. Even if you play alone.  The game leads you to an adventure you get sucked into. The adventure you won't soon forget if you stick to the end.  And the story, especially if you play as one of the preset characters, is just fantastic. I don't remember when was the last time I hesitated so much about making story-related choices in games. Or even not story-related. Some side quests made me do things I feel so conflicted about even now! Love it.  Games like this make me remember why I like games more than just as a time killing medium. And Larian manages to remind me about it over and over again for... oh, dear, 15 years already!"

But, the main flesh of this game lie in the GM mode. The freedom of expression given to the GM is almost as deep as an actual pan and paper campaign. If you have a decent GM and players, fun will be had. I hope to see more players making the jump to GM and creating unique campaigns. I would gladly pay for more GM mode content, allowing for further customization and freedom to tell your/my story. I spent at least 120hrs just building my campaign ""Olboria"" and still find room for improvement within the world and story. I plan to continue to revise and balance my campaign through multiple runs. If you're a fan on pen and paper rpgs, but dont have any local friends to play with, this is the game for you!

Everything is voice acted, which means eyes glossing over reading walls of text for hours straight doesn't happen. The combat is fun and the game feels really polished. There is a couple things they're tweaking/balancing which will polish everything out, not to say there is huge issues however.  My biggest gripe with the game is that itemization is a little unrewarding. Majority of the time, a uncommon items of a tier higher than rares, epics and even uniques of a teir below is strictly better. That's not fun imo, so it makes managing gear sometimes annoying/tedious vendoring shoping for upgrades each level.   Multiplayer is great, and I'm already stoked to replay the game adding that element."

My PC can only handle it on Medium but it's still really pretty and run smooth. The first thing that will hit you though is how magical the soundtrack is. The people who did the music really knocked it out of the park.  One of the new feature is the Origin Story which is basically premade characters with independant questlines meaning that if you play with someone and you choose a different character than you'll have things to do that the other won't and the same for them. I'm not a big fan of fixed character but the story of the one I went with (Lohse) is pretty interesting so far. Even if you choose one of the Origin Stories you still can customize your character's hair, hair color, Skin color, facetype and class.  I haven't played a lot but I'm already hooked. It's a game still in Alpha and it's better than some I've seen in final state. Larian Studio have showed that they make quality games and this is no different. I highly recommend the game."

Lavo,341,5,0,"October 11, 2016",Recommended,216.9,"After some time, I'm finally able to give my final thoughts.   Graphics: Animations and effects feels and looks smooth and polished. I love how the water and fire looks in this game. During co-op play with a friend of mine there were couple graphical bugs or glitches, but nothing major.  Characters: You can choose to play one of the six origin character, each with they own story or you can create your own custom character. Some NPCs may recognize your origin character as an old friend or someone they are hired to murder. This helps flesh out each origin character and it really makes you think how some encounters would have went with different character.  Combat: Characters can use all kinds of spells, skills or items to get out of tricky situation. Turn-based combat gives player(s) plenty of time to look around and make best use of their surroundings. Electrify water puddle (or create one if there is none) to stun enemies or freeze it to make them slip and knock themselves out. What I'm missing from Divinity: Original Sin is smoke cloud to block visibility from enemy rangers.   Also one major difference between Divinity: Original Sin and Divinity: Original Sin 2 combat is how to block / resist status conditions like fear, stunned etc. Instead of investing points to certain ability to increase your chance to resist getting stunned, in Divinity: Original Sin 2 you have physical and magical armor values, which block status conditions as long as corresponding armor value is higher than zero. I think this is a nice improvement.  Music and sound: Voice acted characters (player and npc) sounds great and hearing they saying their lines makes conversations feel lively. Sound of nature such as walking on sand, water or fire sounds life like and real. Add great music and you have one potion of eargasm. Love it!  Overall, I highly recommend any RPG fan to get this game or Divinity: Original Sin (Enhanced Edition) or maybe both."

So many characters, so many stories and so many places to explore - Open world: go wherever you want, the game guides you in a very slight way allowing you to wander around as you may please - Decissions matter: every dialoge option will have an impact on the outcome of the conversation and the story. Every character has unique dialogue options with the same character, making the game deeper and more realistic.  - Turn-based Combat mechanics focused on tactics over clicking like nuts - Great soundtrack - Deep crafting mechanics - 360¬∫ camera + tactical view mode (top down)  Cons:  - Can be hard to get into. Lacks some more explanation of the mechanics at the beginning - If you missclick a talent or skill point you cannot take it back - Sometimes sound gets a bit laggy  For me this game is a must have. 10/10"

Now before you say it was not perfect, let me say there is no such thing as perfection, we seek it and hopefully never find it. DOA was brilliant and that is a fact, not an opinion.  DOA2 well its ""more of the same"", and I know when people usually say that it is followed by a sigh and resignation and usually ""Uh"".  However not in the case of DOA2 it does all the DOA tick boxes but adds more, and I mean more in a very good way.  An example is when you start out in DOA2 you will find that crafting plays an important part of getting better equipment to survive.  There are even more ways to complete quests and some ways you can avoid quests, for example there are various ways to leave and some require a clever tongue others brute force or stealth and so much more.

Ser Medieval,311,5,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,94.7,"This game legitimately surprised me, I was having fun in the Early Access without the full extent of the game being there but I could've never imagined it would be this in-depth.   The voice acting, the gameplay and graphics, the storyline... EVERYTHING! The game is incredibly engaging, probably one of the most engaging strategy RPGs I've seen to date, and it already feels like a proper sequel to the first Original Sin game by a long shot.  It's clear to see with Divinity Original Sin 2 that it has a great deal of replayability and that there are many ways to go about each and every situation.  The combat feels seamless and full of action, especially with the ability to use our environment to our advantage. Each battle presents a challenge that forces you to strategize each and every action. Or risk possible sudden death for your party members.  The voice acting makes the conversations bearable to sit through and allows you to pay attention to what's going on in the storyline and in all of the individual characters stories and react accordingly. Not to mention that (without spoilers) the storyline will keep you on your toes and wondering what comes next.  Not to mention you can experience this game with 3 other players! Each player just doubles/triples/quad's the experience and it only gets better and better as time goes on.   In conclusion!  Gameplay: 9.5 (Nobody does Turn-based Strategy Combat quite like Larian Studios) Story: 9 so far (Only in Act 1 at the moment) Replayability: 8 (You could beat this at least 2-3 times in a row without getting bored imo) Sound: 9.8 (Voice acting is on point, combat sound effects and music are fantastic, magnifique) Graphics: 10/10 (The cities, the swamps, the forests, the fires, the waters...

Blackadar,366,6,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,115.9,"Almost copy/paste of the original DoS2 review, this has been updated for the new edition.  I could just about copy and paste my D:OS review for D:OS 2. The short versions is that if you liked D:OS you'll like 2. If you didn't enjoy the first you won't like the second. So if you have experience with the first title, there's your answer. You can stop reading now. The rest of this review is aimed at those who haven't played the first game.  I thought the first was a GOTY contender in 2014 and I think #2 is a GOTY contender in 2017. But it's going to get tougher to keep recommeding this series when the same bugs and flaws keep showing up. So let's start with those flaws.  1. The obscure quests still remain from the original and you often have no idea how to move a quest forward or where to go next. The quest log is still quite useless. Some quests are quite obscure looking for objects that you may have uncovered (or not) including at least one with an object from a prior area. 2. Some screens are too much of a pixel hunt and the highlight button doesn't highlight most objects.  3. The difficulty curve is, frankly, stupid. Larian still needs to tone down the difficulty on lower difficulty levels and smooth the curve. You will likely hit problems in the low teens and then the endgame battles are stupid difficult. 4,. BUGS. Larian still can't test out bugs for‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• For instance, I finally won the final battle...only to have the game keep me in combat meaning I had to do the whole frickin' thing all over again. I finally got through it again and the voice-over proceeded to give me the wrong ending. DAMN IT LARIAN, YOU HAD ONE JOB!  Now on to the good stuff.  Like the first game, this game has the best turn-based combat ever to appear in a RPG. This is the meat of the game and it's sooooo tasty. There are many options on how to approach a battle, so many builds and so many tactics that it's impossible to even scrape the surface in a review. Literally no other RPG gives you this kind of build and combat flexibility.  Every encounter is a combat puzzle and most of them are fun. Sometimes an encounter seems impossible and then you figure out a strategy to make it relatively easy. This series remains the high-water mark of RPG combat and you could play it many times with many different builds because they play so differently. The AI is quite good to the point of being frustrating. You can - and will - get stun locked in certain battles (frustrating!). As I said, this is the core of the game.   The rest of the game is good too, even if it doesn't quite measure up to the combat excellence. The back stories of the starting characters are great and your party members seem to be far more developed this time. The voice acting has been consistently great and the music and sounds are still top-notch. The environments are quite beautiful and quite detailed though they are sometimes so busy the game delves into a pixel hunt. The races are really quite neat and there's a couple here that are fairly original which isn't easy to do in an RPG. The RPG aspects just feel more fully fleshed out in this version. The synergy between the NPCs doesn't seem to be very good to start but after a few rough bumps the first two levels it's easier to figure out how you want to blend your party. Truthfully, I haven't seen much in the Dev Cut that I didn't recall from the original but I'm sure there's some new stuff.  DoS2 is a step forward from the original and both are excellent games. Recommended for any RPG fan."

Kozzy - Red Dead Redemption 2!,587,15,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,194.8,"Divinity Original Sin 1 was good, but Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of the best rpg's of not only this year, or of this generation, but of all time. The writing is a huge improvement, the voice acting is brilliant and the strategic combat is even better than before. The game is a blast solo or with a friend, tons of customization and many ways to go about doing missions. So many cool skills to play with it is amazing!  I have not been this addicted to a modern roleplaying game since Fallout New Vegas or The Witcher 3 (Sure I loved Divinity Original Sin 1, Dragon Age origins, Pillars Of Eternity,etc.. but these are on another level for me personally). Every aspect shines in this game and my biggest complaints are improved this go around. Larian deserves a ton of respect and love for making such a great, epic roleplaying game. This game has a ton of replay value and will played for many more hours for me.   Games of this quality don't come out that often, go support Larian and buy this wonderful game, get ready for some wonderful adventures! Hands down GOTY for me in 2017. I enjoyed alot of games this year but nothing game close to the total package Divinity Original Sin 2 offers. If you enjoyed Divinity original Sin 1, pick this up ASAP.  If you didn't like Original Sin 1, there is still a good chance you will fall in love with the sequel, as everything is improved.  Well done Larian, well done!  **Over 170 hours later, what a game! Not only one of the best rpgs of modern times but also ever. Just a real joy to play and you can tell the developers put a ton of effort into this game. Other rpg devs take notes! The game has the best turnbased combat, much improved writing, wonderful world design, tons of fun quests, it is very challenging (Dark Souls who?) and gorgeous art design. While it is great when playing solo, this game has some of the best coop with a friend (or a few) that I have ever witnessed, not just in rpgs but any genre, grab a friend and get ready for a really amazing ride. This is a perfect example for how to turn a good game's sequel into a much improved (in nearly every aspect) masterpiece**  **The Definitve Edition has come out and it is fantastic, what a wonderful job Larian does at giving us a free enhanced edition a year later. Last years GOTY just got better, somehow! I can't wait to see what Larian does next, they have been on fire lately!**"

Many places to explore, many people to persue and many 'ventures to subdue. One of the most epic experiences so far delivered in a fantasy world, giving us more control on builds to make - be anything you want! Combine your summoning skills with your tanking approaches, making yourself a strong opponent to those who dare to face you. Many quests to complete; each one of them has a good start and its up to you entirely how you would like the result to be. Turn based combat mechanics, along with some events that occur during the fight turn tides for both of sides, watch for a third invader! A bit of a rushed character development at the start, but you will get the gist of each easily the more you interact with them, all of them provide many benefits and great moments to witness your character engaging. Play with friends, play in-character during dialogues that can make the options wider in terms of gameplay and character benefits.

LMW-YBC,137,4,1,January 20,Recommended,126.8,"I bought this game knowing nothing about the franchise or of its background. My friends wanted to play it as it had co-op and looked pretty nice from the screenshots we had, so we all picked it up and gave it a go. 50 hours later, we eventually managed to finish our first playthrough, and what I came out with is one of the most enjoyable game experiences I have ever had, and without a shadow of a doubt my game of the year for 2017.  First of all, I did not expect the writing or voice-acting to be as good as it is. There is a lot of genuinely captivating moments the game has and a good amount of decisions you can make, either as an individual or as a party. You really do feel like you are on this grand adventure, and you essentially make your own story (even if you play as one of the origin characters) which is awesome.  Now, I think I need to get onto what is the most amazing part of this game: the gameplay. On the surface it seems quite simple, and it isn't exactly difficult as you have plenty of time to make decisions and your abilities clearly show what you can and cannot do in your current position. But if you take the time to experiment with things, you can discover new things that can entirely change the way you battle. Elements can combine to create strong new effects, objects and characters can be blessed to create entirely different effects based on their surroundings, combining abilities can create fantastic (and sometimes even hilarious) opportunities for your party, and so on. You are actively encouraged to try out new things, which is something I rarely see games do now.  The diversity of abilities is also a huge plus. There are a bunch of skill paths you can choose from, each having their own unique abilities. You can focus on having a bit of everything, or you can focus on a couple of paths, but whatever you do you will be able to make it work as with many paths you have a lot of capabilities to control the battle, and with less paths your abilities will be much stronger and capable of dealing a lot of damage. Finding a mix-and-match of what works for your team best is part of the fun, you can even change your stats entirely at a certain point so you can change if you feel your current ones aren't working.  I think it's no surprise, but the game is damn pretty. Even for a top-down game the level of detail in the world is astounding, and the art style really appeals to me. It never stays the same either, as you explore you will find new areas that have an entirely different look and feel to the last place, usually accomodated by new enemy types as well. I love the different races and how they look, as well as how differently they are represented in the game's society. It's an exceptionally well-made fantasy world that still manages to be believable.  Such a great game, if you are even remotely into RPGs I would say give this one a go. It's best played with friends for sure, although playing solo is fine, too."
AstroBoltos ‚ú¶,135,4,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,287.2,"One of the most immersive RPG's I have ever played, although it's only a part of Act I the world in Divinity feels ro rich in life and lore. Playing classic mode is just about right in terms of difficulty the turn based combat makes it super complex, it's both easy to understand but  hard to master. Combat is super tactical you will find yourself struggling to keep your party at bay fighting hordes of enemies. The enemy A.I. feels natural as if you where actually facing a big threat in the dungeons, but it balances out with how good you level up and build your party. There's a bunch of stuff you can do while in combat such as positioning and combining different elements to your advantage but it's still very fun and doesnt feel repetitive. The crafting gets a little confusing, dont know if it's because I haven't found many recipes but through combining you pretty much go blindly into it and expect to get soom goodies such as consumables and learn the recipe.  The decision making in this game is pretty much a big deal, since it signifcantly affects the people you interact with and the outcome of any conversation related to your actions or thoughts. For an early access game its 10 times better than any mediocre regurgitated unpolished garbage on steam.  The Core gameplay will be fighting and looting corpses to get stronger, but you will find yourself with a lot of quests from various NPC'S and sub-story lines. Although I felt a little insecure with how quests didnt show any markers on the map or minimap it is very immersive that while chatting with NPC'S they can pin point a location of interest in the quest if the person you're talking to actually knows about it, instead of just telling you to do something and you as a player just feel like you are going through rails while discovering quests.   The amount of time I spent reading and nitpicking through my journal and conversations was just about right, not too confusing but not too easy, the game really does a great job at treating you as a competent player. While its easy to get lost on objectives and questlines you can always go back to the conversations you've had with your journal. The Soundtrack is Amazing you wont even feel it bothering you when jogging or fighting through the maps various and diverse locations.   Overall I said everything I had to although, I had encountered various bugs but nothing a good checkpoint cant fix and I cannot wait for the full realease. A very good experience for a fan of the genre. I think most people should have a fun time, but its far better when playing with your friends and having a blast. Interactivity with the world and the attention to detail that Larian studios has made is superb, trully a nice gem to be found. I strongly recommend you get this game if you are into gaming in general."
Twerk For Satan,500,4,1,"September 10, 2017",Recommended,17.4,"It's here the game has finally released and oh my god it's better than I expected it to be. This game is the perfect example of an Early Access game that made promises and delivers on ALL of them. The finished product is better in everyway to the buggy alpha build that was given to the Early access players.   Positives:  - Outstanding voice acting that fits the narrative and theme.   - Complex yet simple combat with barely any bugs (Haven't seen any yet)  - A brilliant soundtrack that fits in all the situations so far to keep the player immersed.  - Game Master mode to create your own story and have your friends play as you are the narrator/creator  - Goregous scenery and models, the textures are rich in color and details.  - The tweaked skills feel more polished (so far)  - You feel the love the devs put into it in every little nook and cranny of the game.  - The thrill and suspense of a board game on pc (Elements of course)  - Interesting characters with unique origins   - Dialogue options in common conversation really do make a difference on how the npcs/world sees you as a character.  Cons  - So far none   I will come across something at some point that rubs me the wrong way but so far it's been such a smooth and amazing expierence that I HIGHLY recommend people to buy. I'm stingy when it comes to money and games since most don't warrant the price that they are being sold for... but this game...

In my darkest hour, with only myself remaining and surrounded by vicious enemies...I looked into my inventory and saw salvation...""Death Fog Barrel"" In that moment I knew what I had to do, I dropped the barrel and hit it hard, everything arround me was dead and there was much rejoicing. And that is how I defeated the chicken warriors of karrakdo'.  I cannot say anything to do the game justice, the only thing I can come close to is that this game has EARNED its right to be called the Game of the Year.  I'd go as far as to say that it deserves game of the decade."
Lazarus,238,4,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,253.3,"27 hours in the game and I haven't even left Fort Joy. Literally... I haven't broken out. I convinced my best friend to join me and we have been hacking away at anything and anyone who seemed like a bad guy. Breaking the game mechanics is legitamately half the fun here. We managed to sneak our way past Magisters by using the teleport spell. Somehow... we always managed to take the back door into every dungeon.   We couldn't stop getting ourselves in trouble at every turn. By the way, getting into trouble is just part of the fun. Speaking of which, be ready to quick save a ton. The developers were kind enough to give 5 quick save slots along with auto saves and unlimited hard saves... Unless you're playing on that insane 4th difficulty, in which you have just the 1 save and a total party kill is very very bad. You basically get your save erased on the hardest difficulty if everyone dies.   Pros: -Break the game dammit. Just do it! I swear finding ways to navigate and utterly cheese your way around a level is amazing. We saved a paladin just by teleporting everyone up to the second floor of the castle, then knock down the ladder, and then sneak to the front door... only to get prepared for a massive fight just before the doors swing open and  a Knight and Battle Mage just flat out turn into hulking battering rams that decimate the first guy they see. The amount of planning that you can make for a battle is amazing... I even got a chance to set up environmental hazards for the enemies by moving poison barrels and oil barrels ahead of a fight.   -The sneaking system is hilarious, but well maintained. Seeing a lizard tail poke out from under a barrel makes me giggle. The enemy vision scales down with higher thievery skills.  -The turn based fighting system is the best I have seen yet. It really feels like a ton of heart and effort has gone into this portion of the game. You need to see it to understand just how much it is like a legitamate DnD pen and paper style turn based system. It brings that niche genre to an immediate resurrection and breathes new life into it. Trust me, if you get this game for any reason, and you like turn based strategy, this is the very reason to get giddy like a damn school girl. The battle system alone is a game changer and was an insta buy for me and my friend.  -Choices, choices, choices. Choose wisely or shoot yourself in the foot... or shoot your friend in the foot... or shoot that annoying cat and feed it to the elf. I'm not joking, that cat is in the way all the time. I can't go 5 seconds without accidently lighting it on fire. The dialogue system is very well done and the choices you make will certainly matter. You can miss massive side quests that actually are very important to the overall story and your well being. Other mission and quests are just there to get your butt into a ton of trouble just because you said ""what's the worst that could happen?"". Everything... Just be careful with your choices. You may also live with any and every choice you make. Bad decisions can follow you and from the looks of it, can have consequences on the quests that get closed off because someone had a bad attitude with you or they got shanked unsuspectedly when you were looking the other direction. However, even bad decisions seem to lead down some interesting paths.   -Dialogue is absolutely amazing. Every character and NPC I have met so far is voiced and has a good feeling to their emotions. They always feel genuine, so far. I have yet to meet an NPC that had seemed overly annoying or out of place. The voice actors have done a really good job. My favorite part is the narrator, who has a soothing englishman's accent and doesn't feel snobby. Once again, props to the voice actors.  Neutral: -Have yet to experience the Game Master mode, yet the tutorial makes it out to be a true Dungeon Master style with 4 players under the control of the DM. You can make full campaigns and there are a literal sh*t ton of options. Just look up Game Master Tutorial on YouTube, which was made by the devs, and you'll see what I mean.  -If you don't pick one of the Main Characters, you may be missing out on massive parts of the story. Do not worry. If you create a custom character, you still have the option of taking 3 of the main characters along in your quests. Each main character has their own story and ambitions. Be sure to pay attention to them as they may lead you down some very interesting paths.  Cons: -I am legit am coming up short for things I do not like. There were some minor bugs when the game first released, but the devs seem to have a fast response time and are working diligently on most of the problems we were experiencing. In fact, most of the major issues disappeared on the first week. Sooooo... these are not the cons you are looking for..."

PacManPolarBear,396,4,0,"October 16, 2017",Recommended,142.7,"The realm of Rivellon feels vibrant and alive. At times sunny and cheerful, with delightfully lighthearted moments, but also deeply disturbing and dark, unafraid of having players face things that can only be described as nightmare fuel. One minute you are talking to a happy bear about honey and the next you are running for your life from a giant spider that wants to feed you to its babies. The balance between those two, the light and the dark, is spot on. The storylines are wonderful and interesting, with tons of variety. Side quests don‚Äôt feel like filler content which is a big plus for a game as large and full of things to do as Divinity: Original Sin 2 is.   It's one of the best looking isometric RPG‚Äôs ever made. Each of the games four major areas are exquisitely detailed and beautiful in their own unique way. Characters have subtle animations and visual flourishes that really make them stand out. The colour pallet is vibrant, gorgeous and bright with striking blue, green, red and yellow colours. The game does makes sure to contrast that with deep blacks, subtle grays and dark reds when fighting in the darker, more evil infested areas. Everything is visually interesting.  The soundtrack is wonderful. Joyous and fun one moment, tense and foreboding the next. None of the music feels repetitive or overstays its welcome. The sinister transition music that rings out when you enter truly dangerous areas still makes a shiver run up my spine every time I hear it. The fact that every line of dialogue in the game is voice acted is impressive and almost always of impeccable quality. It really helps sells the games more emotional moments.  The turn based combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2 is all about interconnected systems. Fire ignites poison clouds or oil slicks. Rain puts out fire while ice can trip up enemies and allies alike. Necromancy can raise the dead or curse the living but can be countered by healing magic. Everything has a counterpoint of some type and a well coordinated exchange can take advantage of any number of systems to powerful effect. Unlike D&D games where your characters live or die by a lucky or unlucky roll of the dice, Divinity: Original Sin 2 does not make players worship at the alter of the RNG (random number generation) gods quite so much.  The longer you play the more complex the combat interactions. By the time you reach the mid to late game the list of abilities and spells at your disposal is vast. Even though each character chooses a class at the beginning of the game you can place points into whatever skill trees and abilities you want. The game encourages experimentation and since you can respec as much as you want once you leave the games first area there is nothing to stop you from making a character that is exactly what you want it to be.  The early game leans a bit too heavily on basic elemental exchanges like fire and ice, but eventually you‚Äôll spend just as much time raising the dead, summoning demons, blinding your foes or charming people as you will tossing fireballs and ice shards. Because you have so many options when it comes to combat a lot of players have found ways to cheese the system. Some interactions were things the developers intended, but others are clearly breaking the game in ways they never considered. Patches post launch have addressed some of these issues, such as inflicting bleeding damage on an enemy and then transforming them into a chicken that runs itself to death. Or infinite damage loops that result from the interplay between buffs and attacks. That said the game encourages players to find innovative ways to tackle major obstacles. My personal favorite tactic it using teleport to push a tough enemy into the path of another powerful NPC and watch them tear each other to pieces.  Even with the ability to cheese the system at times and the plethora of options at your disposal, playing Divinity: Original Sin 2 on anything above Explorer difficulty can be really, really tough. Especially your first 10 hours with the game as you learn the intricacies of its many systems and options. The AI is smart and deadly and will throw every trick in the book at you. I restarted my campaign a half dozen times and invested almost 20 hours before I found a party composition and set of builds I felt complemented the way I wanted to play the game.  The game features a robust crafting system. Dozens of spells, potions, meals, enchantments and items can be crafted. You can learn recipes from books or experiment on your own to learn new ones. The one area where crafting falls short is weapons and armour.  Freedom and experimentation is at the very heart of what makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing. It applies not only to combat but how you tackle the games many quests and challenges. Almost everything has multiple avenues of approach and a myriad of solutions. The games main story quests give you a direction to aim yourself at but how you get there is completely up to you.  However this is also where Divinity: Original Sin 2‚Äòs biggest problem rears its head. The game is terrible at informing you if you are on the right track in completing certain quest lines and is often vague, to the point of maddening frustration, when it comes to giving you any sort of hint when it comes to what you should do next. On the one hand it is nice that the game does not hold your hand as if you were a child who never played an RPG before, but on the other it would be nice to know why a quest that seems to be over isn‚Äôt. Sometimes you are not sure if you just missed something or if the quest line is just bugged because you approached it in a way the developers never expected or tested for.  This issue becomes more apparent the further along you get in the game. Act 1 is relatively aggravation free when it comes following quest lines or encountering bugs. But by the end of Act 2 you‚Äôll likely pull your hair out over at least a few quests or nonsensical bugs. The game has been out a month now and I‚Äôm still locked out of a handful of quest the developers have acknowledged are broken because of the way I triggered them. I was able to get past the major bugs that were in my way but a bunch still remain. The very thing that makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing is the same thing that has caused issues with progressing further down quest lines or receiving rewards.  It‚Äôs by no means a game breaker and given the immense size of Divinity: Original Sin 2 and the sheer scope of what you can choose to do its amazing the game does not have more issues. The quest log definitely needs an overhaul and there are several major bugs that still need addressing but Larian Studios has already dropped a few hotfixes and one very large patch to address players concerns. Given the wonderful support Divinity: Original Sin 1 received I have no doubt that Divinity: Original Sin 2‚Äòs remaining blemishes will be ironed out before too long."

Rumbeef,"1,115",4,0,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,175.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game that had me constantly feeling as though I was getting to the point that I was powerful, and then they threw a curveball at me.  It kept me exploring and eating at the edges of quests that I would have to return to later when I was more experienced.  Throughout the game I came up to walls that I had to search for ways around or over, it seemed like the game was always ready for me.  It felt rewarding to figure out something, to get past an enemy who had stopped me before, to try something different with my skills and abilities.    I hadn‚Äôt played any Divinity games before and they had a good way of bringing me into the world they‚Äôve crafted, individual party members had interesting motives and I felt like our interactions were dependant on my input.  The story had a good thread pulling me towards the conclusion of the game and kept me wondering where it was taking me.    I like turn based combat because it usually feels like I‚Äôm responsible for what happens throughout combat, and Divinity has a few ways to have unexpected actions unravel your plans.  The elemental system worked well for this, combining a few different spells could make a whole area a minefield, or clear it by using alternatives.  I didn‚Äôt utilize all the systems, other than a few items I never had to touch crafting and rarely used potions.  The items and loot were enough to have an impact on my builds and I was usually able to get gear I wanted from either quests or vendors.  There are enough abilities and types of play that I could see a second or third run being very different than how I played through the first time.  I only played a little multiplayer, but I enjoyed how we were able to work together to rob and murder people, something I can never bring myself to do when I play solo.  I think they found a good balance around doing turn based rpg combat with multiple people, if one person gets into a fight while their buddy is somewhere else, the buddy can regroup and join into already active combat.  That also works in the single player game as well, I often would start a conversation with an enemy and before combat started I‚Äôd organize my squad and summon a demon for backup.   I got completely addicted to this game when I picked it up, I was impressed by it the whole way through."

Many places to explore, many people to persue and many 'ventures to subdue. One of the most epic experiences so far delivered in a fantasy world, giving us more control on builds to make - be anything you want! Combine your summoning skills with your tanking approaches, making yourself a strong opponent to those who dare to face you. Many quests to complete; each one of them has a good start and its up to you entirely how you would like the result to be. Turn based combat mechanics, along with some events that occur during the fight turn tides for both of sides, watch for a third invader! A bit of a rushed character development at the start, but you will get the gist of each easily the more you interact with them, all of them provide many benefits and great moments to witness your character engaging. Play with friends, play in-character during dialogues that can make the options wider in terms of gameplay and character benefits.   One of the best RPG games I have played in a long time that keeps me sunk in for hours even days now! coming from a guy doing a singleplayer, it is astonishingly entertaining, and the encounters are very memorable.

AstroBoltos ‚ú¶,135,4,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,287.2,"One of the most immersive RPG's I have ever played, although it's only a part of Act I the world in Divinity feels ro rich in life and lore. Playing classic mode is just about right in terms of difficulty the turn based combat makes it super complex, it's both easy to understand but  hard to master. Combat is super tactical you will find yourself struggling to keep your party at bay fighting hordes of enemies. The enemy A.I. feels natural as if you where actually facing a big threat in the dungeons, but it balances out with how good you level up and build your party. There's a bunch of stuff you can do while in combat such as positioning and combining different elements to your advantage but it's still very fun and doesnt feel repetitive. The crafting gets a little confusing, dont know if it's because I haven't found many recipes but through combining you pretty much go blindly into it and expect to get soom goodies such as consumables and learn the recipe.  The decision making in this game is pretty much a big deal, since it signifcantly affects the people you interact with and the outcome of any conversation related to your actions or thoughts. For an early access game its 10 times better than any mediocre regurgitated unpolished garbage on steam.  The Core gameplay will be fighting and looting corpses to get stronger, but you will find yourself with a lot of quests from various NPC'S and sub-story lines. Although I felt a little insecure with how quests didnt show any markers on the map or minimap it is very immersive that while chatting with NPC'S they can pin point a location of interest in the quest if the person you're talking to actually knows about it, instead of just telling you to do something and you as a player just feel like you are going through rails while discovering quests.   The amount of time I spent reading and nitpicking through my journal and conversations was just about right, not too confusing but not too easy, the game really does a great job at treating you as a competent player. While its easy to get lost on objectives and questlines you can always go back to the conversations you've had with your journal. The Soundtrack is Amazing you wont even feel it bothering you when jogging or fighting through the maps various and diverse locations.   Overall I said everything I had to although, I had encountered various bugs but nothing a good checkpoint cant fix and I cannot wait for the full realease. A very good experience for a fan of the genre. I think most people should have a fun time, but its far better when playing with your friends and having a blast. Interactivity with the world and the attention to detail that Larian studios has made is superb, trully a nice gem to be found. I strongly recommend you get this game if you are into gaming in general."

The only problem I've had thus far is that it feels like side content is almost required to stay properly leveled so you don't get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed when you go to an area you are a tiny bit underleveled for.

Claivain,196,4,0,"May 16, 2017",Recommended,599.9,":Early access Alpha review. At the time of writing only the first chapter is available:  Original Sin 2 improves upon every element of the first installment. There are more disciplines (and therefore more powers and skills). The environment reacts to elemental powers in more complex and interesting ways, leading to more tactical options. The new art style is a great improvement for the character models (personal opinion possibly). The combat is still solid, and the writing is still engaging.   All in all, if you enjoyed the first iteration of Original Sin, then I imagine you'll love this one too. My only gripe is that local multiplayer has been removed, and online is the only option if you want to play with friends. While this may not be a massive issue for some people, I played through the first version using couch co op with my wife, and I'd have liked to do the same again with this one, however it is not possible. I'm not sure whether it's a planned feature for the full release or not, so maybe it'll be added in the future.   All in all, fully recommended."

This game is the opposite of handholdy so when you use the mechanics to figure out a unique solution to a problem it is incredibly satisfying as nothing tells you to do certain things in certain ways.

There are secrets to be found everywhere, all of which give you loot, advance the plot, or reveal something about a character's backstory. The fight mechanics also depend heavily on the environment: element attacks have unique interactions with other elemental surfaces, height and positioning are hugely important in damage calculations, etc. You can choose any subset of characters you want, either custom or prebuilt (with backstory to discover as you play the game). I can't wait to play through the game again with a new set of characters and experience things in a different way, with new dialogue options, skills, builds, and alliances. I have more than 80 hours and haven't even beaten the game yet on the easiest difficulty; this game is 100% worth the money."

AstroBoltos ‚ú¶,135,4,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,287.2,"One of the most immersive RPG's I have ever played, although it's only a part of Act I the world in Divinity feels ro rich in life and lore. Playing classic mode is just about right in terms of difficulty the turn based combat makes it super complex, it's both easy to understand but  hard to master. Combat is super tactical you will find yourself struggling to keep your party at bay fighting hordes of enemies. The enemy A.I. feels natural as if you where actually facing a big threat in the dungeons, but it balances out with how good you level up and build your party. There's a bunch of stuff you can do while in combat such as positioning and combining different elements to your advantage but it's still very fun and doesnt feel repetitive. The crafting gets a little confusing, dont know if it's because I haven't found many recipes but through combining you pretty much go blindly into it and expect to get soom goodies such as consumables and learn the recipe.  The decision making in this game is pretty much a big deal, since it signifcantly affects the people you interact with and the outcome of any conversation related to your actions or thoughts. For an early access game its 10 times better than any mediocre regurgitated unpolished garbage on steam.  The Core gameplay will be fighting and looting corpses to get stronger, but you will find yourself with a lot of quests from various NPC'S and sub-story lines. Although I felt a little insecure with how quests didnt show any markers on the map or minimap it is very immersive that while chatting with NPC'S they can pin point a location of interest in the quest if the person you're talking to actually knows about it, instead of just telling you to do something and you as a player just feel like you are going through rails while discovering quests.   The amount of time I spent reading and nitpicking through my journal and conversations was just about right, not too confusing but not too easy, the game really does a great job at treating you as a competent player. While its easy to get lost on objectives and questlines you can always go back to the conversations you've had with your journal. The Soundtrack is Amazing you wont even feel it bothering you when jogging or fighting through the maps various and diverse locations.   Overall I said everything I had to although, I had encountered various bugs but nothing a good checkpoint cant fix and I cannot wait for the full realease. A very good experience for a fan of the genre. I think most people should have a fun time, but its far better when playing with your friends and having a blast. Interactivity with the world and the attention to detail that Larian studios has made is superb, trully a nice gem to be found. I strongly recommend you get this game if you are into gaming in general."
LMW-YBC,137,4,1,January 20,Recommended,126.8,"I bought this game knowing nothing about the franchise or of its background. My friends wanted to play it as it had co-op and looked pretty nice from the screenshots we had, so we all picked it up and gave it a go. 50 hours later, we eventually managed to finish our first playthrough, and what I came out with is one of the most enjoyable game experiences I have ever had, and without a shadow of a doubt my game of the year for 2017.  First of all, I did not expect the writing or voice-acting to be as good as it is. There is a lot of genuinely captivating moments the game has and a good amount of decisions you can make, either as an individual or as a party. You really do feel like you are on this grand adventure, and you essentially make your own story (even if you play as one of the origin characters) which is awesome.  Now, I think I need to get onto what is the most amazing part of this game: the gameplay. On the surface it seems quite simple, and it isn't exactly difficult as you have plenty of time to make decisions and your abilities clearly show what you can and cannot do in your current position. But if you take the time to experiment with things, you can discover new things that can entirely change the way you battle. Elements can combine to create strong new effects, objects and characters can be blessed to create entirely different effects based on their surroundings, combining abilities can create fantastic (and sometimes even hilarious) opportunities for your party, and so on. You are actively encouraged to try out new things, which is something I rarely see games do now.  The diversity of abilities is also a huge plus. There are a bunch of skill paths you can choose from, each having their own unique abilities. You can focus on having a bit of everything, or you can focus on a couple of paths, but whatever you do you will be able to make it work as with many paths you have a lot of capabilities to control the battle, and with less paths your abilities will be much stronger and capable of dealing a lot of damage. Finding a mix-and-match of what works for your team best is part of the fun, you can even change your stats entirely at a certain point so you can change if you feel your current ones aren't working.  I think it's no surprise, but the game is damn pretty. Even for a top-down game the level of detail in the world is astounding, and the art style really appeals to me. It never stays the same either, as you explore you will find new areas that have an entirely different look and feel to the last place, usually accomodated by new enemy types as well. I love the different races and how they look, as well as how differently they are represented in the game's society. It's an exceptionally well-made fantasy world that still manages to be believable.  Such a great game, if you are even remotely into RPGs I would say give this one a go. It's best played with friends for sure, although playing solo is fine, too."

Many places to explore, many people to persue and many 'ventures to subdue. One of the most epic experiences so far delivered in a fantasy world, giving us more control on builds to make - be anything you want! Combine your summoning skills with your tanking approaches, making yourself a strong opponent to those who dare to face you. Many quests to complete; each one of them has a good start and its up to you entirely how you would like the result to be. Turn based combat mechanics, along with some events that occur during the fight turn tides for both of sides, watch for a third invader! A bit of a rushed character development at the start, but you will get the gist of each easily the more you interact with them, all of them provide many benefits and great moments to witness your character engaging. Play with friends, play in-character during dialogues that can make the options wider in terms of gameplay and character benefits.

darthaegis,187,5,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,56.8,"TL:DR Original Sin II is very good. If you want a game with really fun combat and some good exploration, you've got one right here. The game maintains a higher overall standard of quality than its predecessor, but combat has some big issues and the later two areas are fairly weak. I found it to be good, but I was disappointed at the lack of improvement over a lot of areas where the first game could use some. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ  Divinity: Original Sin II is an isometric RPG where you play as a Sourcerer, a person capable of wielding the mighty power of Source. You get to pick your character and choose a preset class or edit one, and choose an origin or just create a custom character altogether. Origin characters have actual personal stories and motivations in the world besides the beginning of the main plot. My character seemed a bit meh at first (Sebille, an elf looking for the lizard who enslaved her so she could kill him) but it got to an interesting twist. Other characters I picked on my party ended up being more interesting, but you don't get direct access to their conversations. The game isn't really big on choices and consequences, so I found these things mostly side fluff.  The main plot begins with your character and all origin characters, as well as the starting cutscene narrator, being sent to a prison-island (the rather ironically named Fort Joy) to get treated of their Source condition. It's totally fine to be able to shoot fireballs since that's not Sourcery, but using that to remove debuffs or get yourself an extra turn gets you imprisoned because it attracts Voidwoken, creatures which only appear near manifestations of Source. There's quite a lot of ways to escape Fort Joy, which makes it feel a bit strange how there are still so many people inside. There's also the fact there are weapon and skill trader prisoners, which makes me feel the setting wasn't very well thought out.  To be honest, since I played the first game at launch, I wasn't expecting a terrific story/setting from this one. But for all the new writers they hired, it feels like there's not a huge improvement. The story didn't really grab me, even though it was better than the last game's ""There's this big dragon you have to defeat."" It did the job for giving you an extra reason to explore the world, but I didn't find it anything groundbreaking. After 56 hours I got the ending cutscene showing the consequences of my actions throughout the game ala Fallout, and I found I didn't remember half the people the cutscene was talking about at first (one or two I chuckled while hearing what they did after the ending, since I actually killed them in the game).  Anyway, enough with story crap, since the Original Sin games are more about exploring and using massive cheese to kill things or reach places which are difficult to reach. Exploration is fun, and there's a lot of interesting things to find in the four areas of the game, but the latter two (also, fortunately, the shortest, occupying roughly 15 of my 56 hours) are where the game starts to fall off in quality. The final area seemed to lack polish on a basic level, even: I found a corpse named UNKNOWN and a portrait with the name ""Painting of a Fan - Placeholder"". The first two areas tend to be more fun, but the thing is they felt fairly railroaded as for where to go. Even though you can sometimes go to places you have no business being in by use of teleportation skills, it's often very hard to fight enemies which are even only one level above you. This makes it so you have to almost take a specific path through the game in order not to find massive difficulty spikes. The second area also feels a bit themepark-y, with some clear sub-area separation by a sort of theme (desert, cemetery, etc.).  Exploring will get you some really creative quests, ranging from helping animals find love to more serious matters like stopping people from getting killed. The quest log doesn't often give you an ultra-clear indication on what to do, so it's fun to experiment a bit (though sometimes what you have to do to progress is fairly weird to think of, especially towards the endgame). Your characters will often find hidden switches and buried chests with treasure, too. The items are mostly randomized and you won't stay with them for long since they become obsolete at level up, but it's still fun to find good loot.  Original Sin II's strongest point, like its predecessor, is, of course, the combat. Unfortunately, they ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up some things here. First, the level difference is the most important stat in combat unless you intend to do ungodly cheese like unloading boxes of Deathfog on someone (instantly killing any non-undead) or teleporting them to a high-level NPC, and this is worse at certain levels where HP and damage numbers just get an arbitrary 50% boost. Then you have the fact that everything has been very much simplified (attributes and skills pretty much only giving +5% bonuses to a stat now, and there being a fixed AP for all characters unless hasted, which means you pretty much level your damage stat in braindead mode until you need some initiative or skill slots). You also have a new armor system made to make combat not be a disable-fest immediately, but having it take three turns of whittling down a secondary HP bar so you can start a cancerous disable-fest. Finally, initiative (the stat which determines how early your turn is in the whole combat round) is broken and non-moddable unlike the rest of these problems. It's basically a forced player-enemy-player round order which makes initiative a lot less meaningful.  With the (massive) problems combat has out of the way, the big upside to it is that it's still ridiculous fun. The addition of two new skill types (Polymorph and Summoning) increased the variety in builds by a lot. Unfortunately you can't respec on the first act, but this helps figure out a party plan for the rest of the game, where you can do it with no cost. I ended up going with a sub-optimal party composition (with three massive physical damage dealers and only one magician, which doesn't often work well because of the armor system, where there is a separate value for physical damage/disable blocking and magical), but it got me through the game with no major difficulty (though I must stress that since I didn't find my level's area at a certain point in the game, I started squeezing every bit of XP from quests I had left, leaving me overleveled by 1-2 levels for 40% of the game, which made it probably a lot easier). Each skill type has quite a lot of different spells, enabling your creativity to get out of particularly hard fights. While physical damage is mostly clean for the environment, magical will make your battleground an entertaining chaos of fire, poison and electrified water, to name a few (mostly fire though), and I don't think I'll forget a certain fight on an oil rig (I imagine my graphics card won't either, as it's likely scarred from having to render so much goddamn fire!) This doesn't mean physical damage is less fun, as both the Scoundrel and Warfare trees give some decent mobility for melee fighters to get into position and backstab or smash foes to the ground, and rangers are made more fun in this game with the addition of high ground, making positioning even more important, and fights more interesting in general. The summoning skill tree is mostly about strengthening your summons, the main one being the Incarnate, whose abilities change depending on the surface it's cast on (the Incarnate gets a powerful upgrade ONLY at max summoning, which I found fairly dumb). It's really amazing that with all its problems, Original Sin II's combat is still so goddamn fun.  In the end, it's more Original Sin: the story's better, and exploring and fighting still rewards creativity. I was disappointed that they didn't improve that much, but I still had good fun with the game."

darthaegis,187,5,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,56.8,"TL:DR Original Sin II is very good. If you want a game with really fun combat and some good exploration, you've got one right here. The game maintains a higher overall standard of quality than its predecessor, but combat has some big issues and the later two areas are fairly weak. I found it to be good, but I was disappointed at the lack of improvement over a lot of areas where the first game could use some. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ  Divinity: Original Sin II is an isometric RPG where you play as a Sourcerer, a person capable of wielding the mighty power of Source. You get to pick your character and choose a preset class or edit one, and choose an origin or just create a custom character altogether. Origin characters have actual personal stories and motivations in the world besides the beginning of the main plot. My character seemed a bit meh at first (Sebille, an elf looking for the lizard who enslaved her so she could kill him) but it got to an interesting twist. Other characters I picked on my party ended up being more interesting, but you don't get direct access to their conversations. The game isn't really big on choices and consequences, so I found these things mostly side fluff.  The main plot begins with your character and all origin characters, as well as the starting cutscene narrator, being sent to a prison-island (the rather ironically named Fort Joy) to get treated of their Source condition. It's totally fine to be able to shoot fireballs since that's not Sourcery, but using that to remove debuffs or get yourself an extra turn gets you imprisoned because it attracts Voidwoken, creatures which only appear near manifestations of Source. There's quite a lot of ways to escape Fort Joy, which makes it feel a bit strange how there are still so many people inside. There's also the fact there are weapon and skill trader prisoners, which makes me feel the setting wasn't very well thought out.  To be honest, since I played the first game at launch, I wasn't expecting a terrific story/setting from this one. But for all the new writers they hired, it feels like there's not a huge improvement. The story didn't really grab me, even though it was better than the last game's ""There's this big dragon you have to defeat."" It did the job for giving you an extra reason to explore the world, but I didn't find it anything groundbreaking. After 56 hours I got the ending cutscene showing the consequences of my actions throughout the game ala Fallout, and I found I didn't remember half the people the cutscene was talking about at first (one or two I chuckled while hearing what they did after the ending, since I actually killed them in the game).  Anyway, enough with story crap, since the Original Sin games are more about exploring and using massive cheese to kill things or reach places which are difficult to reach. Exploration is fun, and there's a lot of interesting things to find in the four areas of the game, but the latter two (also, fortunately, the shortest, occupying roughly 15 of my 56 hours) are where the game starts to fall off in quality. The final area seemed to lack polish on a basic level, even: I found a corpse named UNKNOWN and a portrait with the name ""Painting of a Fan - Placeholder"". The first two areas tend to be more fun, but the thing is they felt fairly railroaded as for where to go. Even though you can sometimes go to places you have no business being in by use of teleportation skills, it's often very hard to fight enemies which are even only one level above you. This makes it so you have to almost take a specific path through the game in order not to find massive difficulty spikes. The second area also feels a bit themepark-y, with some clear sub-area separation by a sort of theme (desert, cemetery, etc.).  Exploring will get you some really creative quests, ranging from helping animals find love to more serious matters like stopping people from getting killed. The quest log doesn't often give you an ultra-clear indication on what to do, so it's fun to experiment a bit (though sometimes what you have to do to progress is fairly weird to think of, especially towards the endgame). Your characters will often find hidden switches and buried chests with treasure, too. The items are mostly randomized and you won't stay with them for long since they become obsolete at level up, but it's still fun to find good loot.  Original Sin II's strongest point, like its predecessor, is, of course, the combat. Unfortunately, they ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up some things here. First, the level difference is the most important stat in combat unless you intend to do ungodly cheese like unloading boxes of Deathfog on someone (instantly killing any non-undead) or teleporting them to a high-level NPC, and this is worse at certain levels where HP and damage numbers just get an arbitrary 50% boost. Then you have the fact that everything has been very much simplified (attributes and skills pretty much only giving +5% bonuses to a stat now, and there being a fixed AP for all characters unless hasted, which means you pretty much level your damage stat in braindead mode until you need some initiative or skill slots). You also have a new armor system made to make combat not be a disable-fest immediately, but having it take three turns of whittling down a secondary HP bar so you can start a cancerous disable-fest. Finally, initiative (the stat which determines how early your turn is in the whole combat round) is broken and non-moddable unlike the rest of these problems. It's basically a forced player-enemy-player round order which makes initiative a lot less meaningful.  With the (massive) problems combat has out of the way, the big upside to it is that it's still ridiculous fun. The addition of two new skill types (Polymorph and Summoning) increased the variety in builds by a lot. Unfortunately you can't respec on the first act, but this helps figure out a party plan for the rest of the game, where you can do it with no cost. I ended up going with a sub-optimal party composition (with three massive physical damage dealers and only one magician, which doesn't often work well because of the armor system, where there is a separate value for physical damage/disable blocking and magical), but it got me through the game with no major difficulty (though I must stress that since I didn't find my level's area at a certain point in the game, I started squeezing every bit of XP from quests I had left, leaving me overleveled by 1-2 levels for 40% of the game, which made it probably a lot easier). Each skill type has quite a lot of different spells, enabling your creativity to get out of particularly hard fights. While physical damage is mostly clean for the environment, magical will make your battleground an entertaining chaos of fire, poison and electrified water, to name a few (mostly fire though), and I don't think I'll forget a certain fight on an oil rig (I imagine my graphics card won't either, as it's likely scarred from having to render so much goddamn fire!) This doesn't mean physical damage is less fun, as both the Scoundrel and Warfare trees give some decent mobility for melee fighters to get into position and backstab or smash foes to the ground, and rangers are made more fun in this game with the addition of high ground, making positioning even more important, and fights more interesting in general. The summoning skill tree is mostly about strengthening your summons, the main one being the Incarnate, whose abilities change depending on the surface it's cast on (the Incarnate gets a powerful upgrade ONLY at max summoning, which I found fairly dumb). It's really amazing that with all its problems, Original Sin II's combat is still so goddamn fun.  In the end, it's more Original Sin: the story's better, and exploring and fighting still rewards creativity. I was disappointed that they didn't improve that much, but I still had good fun with the game."

The story is clever and riveting from the beginning to the end, and keeps the player rabidly invested in the development of both the characters and the state of the world. The story is supported masterfully by the (fully voice acted) dialogue, ambient music, and gorgeous art.   The combat in this game just... makes sense. Veterans of RPG games will have no trouble understanding the system, but even newcomers to the genre can pick it up in the space of a few battles. The game's combat continues to throw you curveballs in terms of player and enemy abilities, but they all fit snugly within the bounds of the overarching system. You'll feel like a strategist, unconsciously planning out the best ways to apply your characters' different abilities to best slay enemies with different armour types and quantities.  Divinity is an apt title for this franchise. The gameplay, story, and aesthetics are all worthy of that mantle. I could honestly see this game as a contender for best RPG of all time."

My wife and I are always in the market for a good couch-coop game, and this one is spectacular.  My only complaint with the gameplay is that there is a LOT of inventory management required, at least if you want to i. have adequate gold and ii. don't want your inventory to look like a crazy bag lady got a hold of it. I've also found the game to be pretty buggy at times, though it's only actually crashed once in more than a hundred hours of gameplay."

Kite,43,3,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,208.0,"Very addicting game. There are a lot of freedom in the game, the actions of the player will affect how other npcs act towards the player. Voiced dialogues with decriptive narration as if you are reading a book!   The combat is absolutely amazing especially for those of you that love using magic.  Whenever the player use a spell ie. Rain which will cause the area the leave puddles of water. The player can cast various spell on the water affected area for different status effect.  Casting aerotheurge skills on the water will cause electrocutions, casting poison will turn the water into pools of poison then use fire spells on the poison to release explosions!   There are so many ways of playing inside combat.  At first classic mode may be difficult for players that haven't got use to the game mechanics. One big tip is breaking enemies respective armor (physical/magic armor)  different enemies have different amount, some with lower physical and some with lower magical. Now then you'll have to carefully choose the right character to unleash damage on the enemy with physical or magical damage. Once the armor is broken you are free to put status effects on them to make them more vulnerable or simply crowd control them. Split your party before going in combat! And make uses of line of sight, make the enemy use ap on moving,   This game requires you to plan your strategy ahead, laying a spell and think of what that spell will affect for next few turn.   The world is stopping you from using your most powerful magic! But you hunger to unleash your full strength on to the world. Then this game is for you!"

Its up there with Skyrim for me. There are bugs and weird things like ""why am i not in range"" stuff like that but this game and the endings were fantastic.

Teteh,240,3,0,August 30,Recommended,253.6,"Definetely one of the best rpg I ever played and one of my favorite game of all time.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a very refined rpg with a decent 30-ish hours of content without taking into account the amazing replayability (Thanks to the origin character having varying stories and the game having a branching scenario.)  The combat system is close to perfect, the bossfights can be very challenging, the voice acting is great, everything is very pretty and each mechanic is really interesting and in-depth.   The only way I can describe how great this game is is not by stating the endless list of things it does perfectly, but by listing the only few things it could do better: -A few glitches getting you stuck in dialogues when playing coop -Half of the ending cutscene not playing for players who choosed to fight for Divinity and lost -Easy to overlevel and trivialize the game until the last few bosses  And trust me I had to dig deep into my brain to find you that handful of flaws because this game is truly close to perfect. I'm the first person to always find the tiniest detail to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about in every single game I play (My friends hates me) but Divinity: Original Sin II is the first game I sunk 8 hours in and surprised myself I didn't get stupidly angry at anything!  I'm 250 hours in and I only cleared the story once, I still want to know the side story of Fane and Lohse, I still have quests I forgot to do, and so on! This game is not only great, but it's full of content that will make sure your money spent on its heavy price tag is worth it!  I should also mention that the game have a Gamemaster mode that allow you to design and play typical Dungeon and Dragon campaign with your friends online, without the hassle of collecting tons of paper and friends around a table and with the ease of using digital scenery that will nearly always look better than that papier-m√¢ch√© montian you spent 5 hours on!   Overall I believe this game is a must have and even while its price tag is a bit scary, after playing it a bit I knew it was worth the money I spent on it!  Really great game, if you like rpgs and especially if you have friends to play with, don't hesitate, this is probably the best rpg of this decade."

This is THE spritual successor to the Baulder's Gate games that have made their homes in our hearts, some long time ago. Here are reasons I believe this game DESERVES your money:   NO Micro-transactions. Likely, NEVER.    NO Anti-Consumer ""Monetization"" schemes.             NO Bullsh*t.             This game is everything you could want from a game - Epic, honest, and continually nurtured by the devs (Larian Studios).           DEFINITIVE EDITION - An ACTUAL Definitive-level update, FREE for those who already bought it. Worth it for those that haven't yet bought it..   Divine Ascension DLC. It's a high-quality purchase because:    The Original Soundtrack & Score - Contains all 36 (+1 Bonus Song). For you audiophiles: Each song is recorded in a WHOPPING ~1411kbps Bit Rate~ (320kbps is High Quality, so imagine...) Also INCLUDES All 36 songs in FLAC Format as well.

An Organic, Living, Breathing Novel.--This game shall walk you through the beauty that is Rivellon - the world of Divinity. I have become attached to the characters that I play, and those whom I've met in passing and in temporary scenarios. I'm even attached to some of the prominent enemies that rival your own character. There are personalities to be had, and so many things that just resonate with me as a human being. I cannot attest to things that would resonate with lizards or other races though, since I'm only a human at the moment. Perhaps later I shall enjoy the proclivites of Lizardry or Gnomery, or Dwarvery, when I have retired my organic life as a human and returned as one of these races. Gosh I have an active imagination... Moving forward.         Mods - Active Modding Community.--There are mods out for the game, so you can make it yours.

Tucan,668,3,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,69.4," Scroll to bottom for summary    To start off, I just want to say that I am really enjoying this game quite a bit. I never played the first one and I decided to take a risk for myself by purchasing this because I have not played many turn-based strategy games that I truly enjoyed/got addicted to in the past.  However  this game has me hooked and at the moment I can't think of hardly any reasons as to why I would stop playing it any time soon.    Ok, but why?    Admittedly this game is definitely not for everyone but hopefully this next part will be helpful to someone who is on the fence about it.    You will likely enjoy this game if you...	  (note: These lists are ordered from the most to least impactful on the experience of the game in each category)   Typically enjoy...     ...combat  	  Turn-Based     Strategy     Co-Op     Party-Based     Tactical  Typically enjoy...     ...Genres	  RPG     Adventure     Fantasy     Open-World  Typically enjoy...     ...Styles/Design Choices	  Story Rich     Character Customization     Atmospheric     Great Soundtrack     Click-to-Move     Isometric/Top-Down (Toggleable by player) If you don't fit into any of the items above then this game probably isn't for you but I would still reccomend that you consider purchasing because as I said earlier, I very rarely enjoy Turn-based strategy games but currently I am enjoying this game a lot.  If based on the things mentioned above you think that you  will  like this game, then below is a list of pros & cons.     Pros  (not in any particular order)     In-Depth Character Customization	 (can be re-customized fairly simply without restarting from the beginging of the game)   Very well polished/detailed level design   Engaging and detailed story	  Vibrant atmospheric environments that each have unique characteristics and/or interesting areas to explore	  Great soundtrack that fits the environments very well	  Multiple ways to solve problems/complete quests	  Rarely uses HUD elements to display your objective (immersive)	  (instead of showing your current objective(s) with the HUD, your quests and assignments are told directly to your character by someone you must find and interact with then your objective is writen down in the journal)   Great NPC character voice acting	  Combat system has a very enjoyable amount of depth and skill required to fully master	  Ability to interact with nearly every item/NPC in the game	  It's very easy to just start playing a co-op game and have fun	  Good veriety of enemies, none of the enemies get overused to the point that they feel repetitive	  High resolution textures and shadows to compliment the beautiful variety of environments	  Cons  (likely that some of these are bugs that will be patched later)     Movement is not as elegant and simple as it could be	 (holding mouse1 or panning to the desired location and clicking)   Using the mouse to pan or rotate the camera is jittery and hard to look at even at very high frame rates	  Friendly AI in combat is poor and can make rescuing a friendly NPC in order to complete a quest feel more like a fight against the game and less like a combat scenario   	  Since there are sometimes very few hints as to where you need to go or who you need to talk to in order to complete a quest it can be frustrating to search an area for an extended period of time simply to complete one objective	  Occasional frame drops or inconsistency of frame times / frame rate in certain areas	  Party members sometimes do not move when the leader is moving until you select a different party member to lead, most commonly when changing elevation via a ladder or vine that leads to a part of the level that is currently on-screen	  Summary:	Divinity: Original Sin 2 can provide countless hours of questing, exploring, adventuring, and monster hunting in it's beautifully designed and expansive open-world with countless areas and secrets to find throughout the entire experience which is glued together by a phenomenal soundtrack and wrapped in a cozy blanket of extrodinary storytelling.   Story     10/10   Graphics     9/10   Gameplay     8/10   Sountrack     10/10   OVERALL 92/100  An absolutely amazing game but I had to take a few points off points for the bothersome movement controls and the friendly AI that tries to kill itself when you are trying to save it."

Besides the last couple days.  Just wanted to get a good idea of what kind of build/party I would be using at launch.  What I experienced was a very vast and amazing upgrades to the systems of original Divinity.  If you enjoyed the original and have been on the fence.  You're worrying for nothing, buy this game it's amazing."

Zenmaster Albert,31,3,0,January 15,Recommended,367.6,"Amazing and immersive story, incredible soundtrack and the first RPG that really sunk me in. The atmosphere of the game is somewhat dark, but humorous at times with a sprinkle of childlike light themes. Has lovable, charming, but yet believable characters. The combat and all questing is never boring.  The game has been a real sense of accomplishment playing through it, it's so much fun to play with friends, so I'd really recommend this as a co-op game. However, playing solo is also very fun. All other games since I bought D:OS 2 have been outclassed by it in sense of enjoyment for me.  Not a short game either with all the mod capabilities, and I've played about halfway through the story in about 122 hours and I've still so much more to explore in the game.  Would really recommend - best RPG experience I've had."
Rhedin,154,3,0,April 25,Recommended,87.1,"I absolutely recommend this game.  It plays like a classic RPG with turn based combat, action economy, skills, spells, multiple ways to build your characters, even multi classing and having it have drop in drop out 4 player cooperative is a very nice feature, can even be modded to have larger parties though you will unbalance the game for yourself and disable achievements. The in game lore and stories play well from one arc to the next and the scenes in which they are set are beautiful.  My only complaints about this game would be the lack of interesting none human player races, though the lizard folk are really nicely designed.  The fact you can move far enough away from active combat (sometimes) to leave combat and thus get infinite and free action economy whilst the rest of your team is playing turn by turn."
werewood,29,3,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,189.5,"Best turn based RPG since the 1998 FallOut2. Post release the fights are much easier, no idea why.

So much character development possibilities. We deserve it. They deserve the credit and our $."
Dicel,215,3,1,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,201.7,"New genre for me, I was very doubtful this would be a game I could get into. My expectations where met with something I've not felt In a long time, I felt the magic of a game world.  I thought that feeling was researved for my childhood, I'd never get that vibe going forward with life, So this alone,  Is enough for me to recommend this gem.  Playing with a crew of life long friends has made it all the more amazing, The disfuntional moments and those times when we pull ourselves together and make things work, to the times when we die in glorious style. We've laughed, given into cheeky impulses, shed a few RP tears, and every step of the way wanted to push fowards to further glory (it has been very hard to put down to sleep)  I think what brings the worlds together for me, was the freedom, we could split up, go anywhere wits would allow, kill anyone who we thought insulted our huge egos. though often we had to reload from a monumental failure, replaying fights was never a dull moment.  on Tacticain mode we could not get over how cunning the AI was, It would do things we struggled to think of ourselves at times. It would run for cover when it needed to, it would exploit every eviromental angle it could, it felt more human than us but with enough human like choices not to seem robotic. Possibly the best AI I've seen, ever.  My Cons: :I feel lost when in comes to recipies, without wanting total knowledge (guides) I was hoping atleast some hints would follow, I've not explored it a great deal, but I feel I'm at 30hours, avioding it.  :Some minor times when range would have clear line of sight, yet to hit an object instead, but I'm talking minor.  :Cannot barter when another is bartering with the same character, I understand perhaps immersion, but convenience, It can be a little annoying.  Pros: :Visuals, sounds, all just perfect.  :Writing quality and quantity, just amazing.  :Freedom of choice, wield any weapon/gear, sandbox relationships.  :Humor inducing deaths and accidents.  :Customization, and the feeling of power with every spell/gear.  :Combat spell elemental synergy, enviromental impact, and fluid easy to understand mechanics.  :Morals and ethical choices, not always black and white.  :Dark ideals, and sinnister characters.  :Fast loading, mostly instant.  :Great difficulty, hard is hard. expect to think/pray.  :Sense of adventure, always more ways than one to do something, exploration rewarded.  :Workshop!  Thankyou! this has to be the first game for me in a long time, I can safely say, beats expectations by miles, and gives me hope for the future of games again.  XOXOXO  "

Wonder Llama,205,3,0,"October 4, 2017",Recommended,271.1,"This is possibly one of the first times I've really stopped to review a game in any thoughtful manner. I'm not one for doing so, or for commenting in public in general. That in itself should tell you something about the sheer brilliance of this game.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is quite possibly one of the best games ever created, or at the very least one of the best RPGs ever made. Never before have I been so sucked in, so compelled by a game and its story, lore, and characters.  One of the first things you'll notice about DOS2 is the atmosphere. The musical cues, the environment, the feel of ever-present danger, a truly epic quest, and of course, the soundtrack. My god, the soundtrack.  Combat is innovative and feels really good. With an 'open-class' concept and enough spells and abilities, you can make just about any kind of character you could imagine. From a blood-sucking witch that dabbles in lightning to a sturdy warrior with a healing spell or two. And more notably, many of these spells can be combined with either others or the environment to create incredible effects. Toss a fireball into a pit of poison to make it explode into flames, or shock a pool of blood or water to possibly stun everyone caught within.  The game is hard at times, surely. Even on the easiest difficulty (which honestly can be -too- easy sometimes), you'll have to have to really think about the battlefield conditions. Honour mode especially gets mention; brutal, wonderfully intense combat mixed with your basic ironman mode. Wipe your whole party and its game over with a single save.  Finally, it's the story that truly shines in this game. I've played a -lot- of games in my day, but hands-down DOS2 is one of the single most powerful games I've played. The main story is sturdy enough to stand on its own and only gets better as you venture onward, and especially the last few hours will have you questioning everything. Your companions, who take the form of the other origins stories you don't pick at the start, have rich storylines each with a very nice twist. The voice acting is excellent, as is the narration, and the ability to romance one of your companions later in the story makes for a pleasant little plot point.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an incredible game, and you can tell Larian took their time to create a masterpiece. They succeeded. I can't see myself putting it down anytime soon. Fans of oldschool-esque RPGs with heavy emphasis on story, rejoice. Our savior has finally come."
Morador,234,3,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,115.5,"Divinity Original Sin blew away my every expectation.  Seeing how Larian Studio built upon the Original Sin, I can only regret I did not give them more money during their kickstarter campaign. A true master piece, from a Studio that seem to have genuine passion for their work."
bigeyoo,136,3,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,137.1,"I enjoyed the original Original Sin (heh) and felt this game would follow suit. I got into the early access and it felt very similar to the first, but more polished and the layout was more efficient.   The story is extremely in-depth, voice acting is exceptional with almost every npc having dialogue, a voice, and personality following suit.  The combat is great, targetting has been improved and what the reticle shows will happen is the actual result for the most part. Occasionally the abilities will miss, or you will accidentally move your character when you misclicked.   My only qualm is really the fact that I now have 6 friends who want to play with me, but we can't really get that together at once."

Splincir,104,3,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,225.7,"One of the best RPG experiences I've had in years. It brings back fond memories of old table top days of playing Pathfinder and D&D.   It's combat is turned based, but don't let that scare you away. It really does feel like a dynamic game of D&D.  The strategy that can go into each situation, whether you try to talk your way out or you just go full murder hobo, is really rewarding.  The games only in early access but it releases today. I can't wait to get my hands on the full title. The 11 hours I've played so far have been very enjoyable Every bit as good and in my opinion better than the original.   The addition of 100% voice over in the final game is just a big bonus for anyone who doesnt want to read a lot, although in this game its well worth the read or listen now. If you didnt play Divinity original sin, you missed out, but dont worry it really seems like it is not a prerequisite for the sequel.   There is definitely stuff in there that is remnants of the past game but the events of the game are 1000 years plus in the future from the original game.   I'm really hoping to get to put the game master mode to the test with friends somwhere down the line. The guys and gals at Larian really out did themselves. Talk about underpromising and over delivering. That was pretty much par for the course for this game, and boy am I glad they delivered.   I don't want to give the game a full rating yet, but I'm definitely throwing a positive thumbs way up for what i've played so far and from everything theyve shown us coming on release."
cowcrusher,173,3,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,162.1,"At 16 hours I had had enough: I HATED this game and logged in to write a scathing review. And yet, 160+ hours later, I‚Äôm on my second playthrough, purchased the previous DOS, and am writing a positive review while listening to the OST. What happened?! This whole misunderstanding started with an impulse purchase and a single, overlooked, very tiny, yet crucial word: tactical.  I had finished a turn based RPG and was in the mood for another, when I saw that DOS2 had just been released. I almost never buy a game at launch, but the trailer looked great, Metacritic boasted a ludicrously high score along with dozens of tasty blurbs, and the whole game had that tantalizing sheen that anything new has. The only negative thing I found at the time was a single review that ranted about rage-quitting the game. Who rage-quits a RPG, I thought at the time?  I took a risk, and was immediately entranced: the character creation was complex and intriguing, the opening story and fight sequences were engaging, everything seemed so promising that I hardly noticed the dreaded word I had overlooked earlier. After a while, however, things took a dark turn for the worse. I kept getting beaten, and beaten badly; my frustration mounted; the world was turning against me; nothing was helping; I felt completely powerless‚Ä¶and then‚Ä¶rage quit.  Amidst the guilt, confusion and shame, I decided to sit down and actually read through all those glowing reviews; what was I missing here? And then I finally noticed it, that dreaded word: tactical. I do not play tactical RPG‚Äôs, never have, assumed I never would, and was unprepared for what I was experiencing here. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt play tactical games, but I like to keep my genres separate, and was clearly not expecting this.  I play games for different reasons. Some for immersion, others for adrenaline, mental stimulation, relaxation, storytelling, etc. For me, RPG‚Äôs equal immersion; that‚Äôs what I expect, why I play them. The acts of becoming a character, building them up, leading them through decisions and adventures, customizing them, engaging in their world, these are creative acts. Tactics, on the other hand, are left-brained; strategy; detached, clinical, chess-like, requiring a different mindset. When I crave that, I‚Äôll play a strategy game. But to combine the two is counter to what I want from a role playing experience.  So, after hours of trying really hard to like this game, only to die repeatedly in the process, I had officially given up. This simply wasn‚Äôt for me. Just as I was about to uninstall, though, something happened, and to this day I still don‚Äôt know what it was. For some mysterious reason, I decided to launch DOS2 one last time. I began to play, I mean really play. By the time I finally escaped Fort Joy, I realized something: this game is getting better; a LOT better. And my negative review? Well, suddenly it was becoming a positive one.  It was still no cake-walk, but my feelings began to change when I altered my play style. Up to then I had been approaching it as any other RPG; and it finally sunk in that I simply can‚Äôt do that. I couldn‚Äôt run blindly into battles, dash wildly about the landscape, race through dialogue; instead I had to slow down, take nothing for granted, become obsessed with details. I also had to redefine what it meant to lose. I had to go into each fight knowing my characters wouldn‚Äôt survive, instead using the chance to study the enemies, how they play, how I react, and how it all unfolds, so when I reload, I can play the fight ‚Äúfor real‚Äù and have a plan in mind. This meant that I had to play most battles upwards of half a dozen times before I got it right; but when things did click into place, it was a beautiful feeling.  Still, I do have a few remaining criticisms, the biggest being the quest and map design. Confusing, unforgiving, unhelpful, oblique, unfair‚Ä¶are but a few of the words I‚Äôd use to describe them. Simply put, it‚Äôs just way too easy to stumble into things you‚Äôre not ready for. As for the quests, dialogues and journal entries are misleading, key information is frequently given out of order, or omitted altogether, way too may red-herrings, and the supposed freedom to tackle a quest multiple ways doesn‚Äôt work if you dare to do things out of order. If you‚Äôre looking for guidance, look to Google, for you will find none in-game. People might tout this as a feature: it doesn‚Äôt hold your hand, they cheer. Indeed. There is no hand-holding, which would be fine if the quest design didn‚Äôt keep tripping over its own two feet.  The map layout is so cluttered and dense that basically each and every pixel is trying to kill you. At first I felt this was infuriatingly random; after a while I did start to pick up on the clues, and was able to avoid such missteps, but it was a lesson learned the hard way. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this, but I‚Äôm used to other games which balance the levels with your current abilities; you can freely wander where you‚Äôre likely to survive, and prevented from getting in over your head. But DOS2 is more than happy to let you get in over your head. The key is to recognize your own limits, knowing the game won‚Äôt do it for you.  As far as audio/visual design, this is single-handedly some of the best art-direction I‚Äôve seen in a game. The detail given to the environments is so rich that the world feels alive in ways that other games could only dream of. Rivellon is LIVED IN; it exists, it‚Äôs lush, and rich in the most unexpected ways. By comparison, all other RPG worlds feel dead, like stage sets populated by mere mannequins. Every square inch of DOS2 is simply bursting with life. The audio is top notch too. I just love the soundtrack. Works brilliantly in game, and is great outside as well. The voices are an absolute treat, too. I don‚Äôt know where they found these actors, but their delivery is infectious. The dialogue is already good, but you can tell how much they really dug their characters, the way they rolled the words around and added such flavor to the lines, making each and every one, from the biggest hero down to the lowest fish monger, feel 100% unique. Seriously, is there an award for best video game ensemble performance?  Regarding immersion, even after coming to terms with a tactical RPG, I was never able to feel that I was part of the world of Rivellon, or that the character I was playing was really me, or that the decisions I made mattered. The story didn‚Äôt haunt me between gaming sessions, I can barely remember most of it now, to be honest. And yet, I‚Äôve had so many individual experiences, so many moments that feel were hand-crafted just for me, so many surprises (both by what I could get away with, and just how flexible the game mechanics really are), that I do feel an emotional, as well as intellectual, connection. This game has given me memories of frustration, true, but also memories of joy, surprise, amazement, wonderment, suspense, excitement, and mischievousness. In spite of the many miraculous accomplishments of this game, it is for these memories that I thank Larian the most.  So now we‚Äôve arrived. That‚Äôs how a sternly negative review, over the course of a few hundred unexpected hours of play, morphed into a shout of praise for what very well might be one of the best RPG‚Äôs ever‚Ä¶even if it is tactical.  But one question remains: what on earth possessed me to keep playing, after I had given up for what I thought was the final time? Was it that I felt goaded into continuing by reading all the other glowing reviews? Perhaps. Was it guilt, that somehow I was missing out on something great? Maybe. Was it stubbornness, since I paid full price, I might as well force myself to enjoy the darn thing? Possibly. All of these things could be true, and could be what drew me back in to the world of Rivellon. It could be. But really‚Ä¶really, I think I did it for the cat."
DARKSIGNAL,48,3,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,77.4,"Pure RPG Perfection.  This is an RPG in the truest form. Let me be clear, this game doesn't do any hand holding. From the character creation to party selection, you are really writing your own story. The combat is the most entertaining turn based system I have ever played. Your enemies will be very tough encounters but every encounter teaches you how to use your parties skills and the terrain to your advantage and you eventually start to win. Winning a fight in this game feels very very rewarding. If you loved the RPG's of old but want to experience them in a modern, compelling way in 2017, there is simply no better experience than Divinity: Original Sin 2  9.5/10"

The development team did a great job and delivered in time which is not a small feat for indie devs. After playing 90 hours including EA following points have to be mentioned in this context:  Pros: 1) Great engaging story, slowness of first game is weared off. 2) Variety of tactical situations and combinations invite the players to strategise and replay 3) Classic RPG elements with DOS flavours mixed. Character role-playing and customisation at its best 4) Branching Story line and Freedom of choices with vast dialogue options. No two play through can be same.  5) Good voice acting  6) Exploration and combat is both satisfying and rewarding. It is never hard never too easy. Difficulty scaling is good.  7) Enemy AI is great and scaled well with difficulty and situations  Cons: 1) Minor glitches in the quest logic and quest resolving system leaving me annoyed sometimes 2) Choices do matter but not always. Sometimes there is no ripple effect in the story development for some choices 3) Armor system is great but not well implemented and did not seem to synergize with tactical choices    A definite buy for any RPG lover."

I would venture so far as to say that even if you just enjoy ""videogames"", the wide spectrum that there are, if you truly are open to new things that you may find scary, and it IS overwhelming at times, this game has something for you.   I have not given myself so fully to a game in what feels like years, and it just keeps giving back to me. Truly a game that, if it hasn't already, will inspire other developers to follow suit. Because we need more delevopers get back to producing labors of love, investing in things they truly care about, and to stop being greedy, lootbox-pushing, soulless corporations.

Su√°rez,108,3,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,367.3,"Long story short: this game is as close as a PC RPG can be to tabletop. 9.5/10    In my opinion, Divinity has 3 main selling points: a deep storyline that unfolds as you progress through the main quest and the various sidequests, and that's shaped by your decisions; a complex combat system that looks simpler that it is at first, and that takes a little while to get used to, and brings some refreshing concepts to tactical RPGs; and almost complete freedom given to the player.  Almost every quest, if not all of them, has more than a single outcome, and plenty of different ways to reach those ends. Furthermore, sidequests often overlap and meet each other, which simultaneously deepens the plot and encourages and rewards players for exploring. Frequently, puzzles or obstacles have multiple different solutions available; depending on your playstyle and party configuration, one solution or another may be easier or simpler.  Starting on Act II, you'll have access to free, infinite resets of your characters' atrributes, stats, and talents. This allows for extreme customization and adaptability - if a particular battle is proving to be too difficult, going back and trying a new configuration can be key. It also encourages players to try different combinations of skills. It should be noted that despite what the character creation screen says, there are really no classes in the game - anyone can be anything. The only requirements for equipment are your main stats (Strength, Finesse, Intelligence and Constitution), and for skills, your Ability Points. As long as you have the money to purchase Equipment and Skillbooks, you can customize your characters at will. (A remark: as of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I am not sure if this reset mechanic is available in the last Act. Most likely, I just didn't find it, but it's worth mentioning nonetheless)  On the flipside, the absolute freedom provided by the game can leave you lost at times. I am a very deliberate player and tried to uncover every quest and each corner of the map, and once, on Act II, I found myself facing very tough battles because I was actually supposed to be on the opposite side of the map - I figured this out when I went to said area and enemies were 3 levels lower than my party, which is quite rare in this game and made those battles trivial even on Tactician mode.  Another little complaint: characters with high Wits can find hidden objects in the map. Most of the time, those are hidden treasures you can dig for loot, but sometimes they uncover quest items, like hidden doors, levers or buttons. When those items are uncovered, your character will they spotted something, and the object will glow; but especially in the case of the small buttons, it's not obvious enough where the object is. It can be quite frustrating to spend minutes looking around for a button - I can understand having to do it manually, but if your character already FOUND it, it should be very clearly marked on the map and/or the screen, even more so in the case of plot related objects.  As for bugs, the game is not nearly as bugged as other reviews have made it sound like, although I only bought the game 3 days after release and the developers have been working on patches constantly, so some earlier bugs may have been fixed before I played the game. As of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I only encountered 3 ""serious"" bugs (naturally, they may be fixed already; also, minor spoilers ahead). The first was in Act II - talking to an NPC with may main character cancelled dialogues and interactions with said character permanently. A quick search on Google revealed a fix for this available a little later in the Act, but I simply loaded a save game made a couple of minutes earlier and proceeded as normal, ignoring the buggy NPC. The second was in Act IV; I was unable to complete the Blood Dowry sidequest, as the groom never appeared in his house's basement at all (probably my fault for breaking into his house and looting his stuff before actually realizing it was a quest point). The last bug was just weird and had no game breaking effect (aside from making me lose 2 Action Points in battle). In the final battle, when I used Battle Stomp on the Kraken, my screen switched to what seemed like the corner of the map, switched back, and no damage was dealt, but the Skill was used. Although I must remark that going after the Kraken was not a particularly promising strategy anyway...  (end of spoilers)  To sum it up, the game is fantastic. The dialogues are rich and provided with excellent voice acting, the plot is deep, the combat is fulfilling and the whole experience feels rewarding. A must have if you enjoy the genre."

Its up there with Skyrim for me. There are bugs and weird things like ""why am i not in range"" stuff like that but this game and the endings were fantastic.

Teteh,240,3,0,August 30,Recommended,253.6,"Definetely one of the best rpg I ever played and one of my favorite game of all time.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a very refined rpg with a decent 30-ish hours of content without taking into account the amazing replayability (Thanks to the origin character having varying stories and the game having a branching scenario.)  The combat system is close to perfect, the bossfights can be very challenging, the voice acting is great, everything is very pretty and each mechanic is really interesting and in-depth.   The only way I can describe how great this game is is not by stating the endless list of things it does perfectly, but by listing the only few things it could do better: -A few glitches getting you stuck in dialogues when playing coop -Half of the ending cutscene not playing for players who choosed to fight for Divinity and lost -Easy to overlevel and trivialize the game until the last few bosses  And trust me I had to dig deep into my brain to find you that handful of flaws because this game is truly close to perfect. I'm the first person to always find the tiniest detail to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• about in every single game I play (My friends hates me) but Divinity: Original Sin II is the first game I sunk 8 hours in and surprised myself I didn't get stupidly angry at anything!  I'm 250 hours in and I only cleared the story once, I still want to know the side story of Fane and Lohse, I still have quests I forgot to do, and so on! This game is not only great, but it's full of content that will make sure your money spent on its heavy price tag is worth it!  I should also mention that the game have a Gamemaster mode that allow you to design and play typical Dungeon and Dragon campaign with your friends online, without the hassle of collecting tons of paper and friends around a table and with the ease of using digital scenery that will nearly always look better than that papier-m√¢ch√© montian you spent 5 hours on!   Overall I believe this game is a must have and even while its price tag is a bit scary, after playing it a bit I knew it was worth the money I spent on it!  Really great game, if you like rpgs and especially if you have friends to play with, don't hesitate, this is probably the best rpg of this decade."

Sit in the mainmenu and let the opening theme drag you into the mood of the game. Start a fight and let the orchestra rise and hype you to fight dragons and demons, or a fistfight in a tavern gets even more roudy with the mixture of brass and string. start the character screen and listen to the origin stories of all the characters for your first game,  listening to the fully voiced professional voice actors lay the background for the Characters own subplots that string along with the main game(Lohse is awesome as is the Red Prince).

Hopefully the steam review system/tagging system gets this game to pop up on your store, because you probably won't hear about it from major outlets or podcasts.

Divinity, however, can be more readily compared to Dragon Age: Origins...only with more story, more character customization, interesting party members and fun yet challenging combat.  There's no need to experience any of the previous games (I didn't).  If you have ever enjoyed RPGs then play this game."

RainyDay,121,3,0,March 31,Recommended,129.6,"An absolutely incredible experience, without a doubt, one of the finest rpgs to date, it certainly is the best I‚Äôve ever played.  I wouldn‚Äôt know where to begin, the world is as interesting and alive as the long and beautifully crafted story, which stays strong for almost all of its entire 130h runtime.  If you‚Äôre new to rpgs, you might be put off by the inherent amount of lore and world building exposition these kinds of games often exhibit, but I must say that the game does a remarkable job of giving you all the information you need without overwhelming you. The world building is constant and just detailed enough as to make you want to fill in the details yourself using your own imagination.  Having not played the original Divinity Original Sin, I did not once feel like I was missing some important piece of lore or that I had missed out on anything story-wise, which is something I truly appreciate from the developers.  The writing is witty, fresh and fully voice acted. Not one person, monster or animal goes without a voice. The voice acting is also excellent, a pleasant surprise seeing how much has been had to be dubbed.  Combat is a lot of fun, and it only gets better the more you level up and are able to experiment with new interesting skills and combos; the only thing I feel could have been done better is how the different skill trees are explained. As it stands, only a very basic description is given, when important information, like that hydro spells are in the most part curative or that pyro spells focus more on damage should be explained somewhere. This is not such a major issue due to the fact that players are given the opportunity to respec at any time once they reach a certain point in the story (fairly early) , but still, it does make investing into certain trees a bit dangerous and daunting as a new player.  Overall, the game has provided me with a beautiful experience and I‚Äôm left reminiscing about my adventures in Rivellon alongside my memorable companions, thinking about what I could have done differently.  If you have even a passing interest in rpgs, try it, you won‚Äôt regret a second of it."

Leonhast,414,3,0,"September 22, 2017",Recommended,23.2,"I've played lots of CRPGs. Baldurs Gate (both), Icewind Dale (both), Fallout (all of them), Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Planescape, Tides of Numenara, Tyranny, Wasteland, Pillars of Eternity, Divinity (all of them), Dragon Age (all of them, unfortunately) and more and more and more. This is one of the best of them. Great setting, different enough to be interesting, but not too strange ... you can identify with story and characters ... oh, yes, interesting characters, too. Combat makes great use of abilities and environment. It can be tough but that's part of the fun for me. I think also that it might have a lot of replayability because you can choose a number of different Origin characters who seem to get slightly different story arcs.  Story ... for my taste way better than Original Sin 1 (same goes for most quests). Can't wait to learn more.  Voice acting (Larian originally did not plan to do it) is a great addition and adds a lot to the game. I backed this game on Kickstarter, it was a no-brainer because Larian did great work with Original Sin 1 and is simply a great company, very much in touch with their fans and customers.  Great company, gem of a game and to top it of: an editor. Looks like this game will keep me busy a long time and I'm having a blast. 10 out of 10 at the moment, I have not finished it yet (actually, it took me over 11 hours to get out of Fort Joy, the ""starting area"")."

cowcrusher,173,3,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,162.1,"At 16 hours I had had enough: I HATED this game and logged in to write a scathing review. And yet, 160+ hours later, I‚Äôm on my second playthrough, purchased the previous DOS, and am writing a positive review while listening to the OST. What happened?! This whole misunderstanding started with an impulse purchase and a single, overlooked, very tiny, yet crucial word: tactical.  I had finished a turn based RPG and was in the mood for another, when I saw that DOS2 had just been released. I almost never buy a game at launch, but the trailer looked great, Metacritic boasted a ludicrously high score along with dozens of tasty blurbs, and the whole game had that tantalizing sheen that anything new has. The only negative thing I found at the time was a single review that ranted about rage-quitting the game. Who rage-quits a RPG, I thought at the time?  I took a risk, and was immediately entranced: the character creation was complex and intriguing, the opening story and fight sequences were engaging, everything seemed so promising that I hardly noticed the dreaded word I had overlooked earlier. After a while, however, things took a dark turn for the worse. I kept getting beaten, and beaten badly; my frustration mounted; the world was turning against me; nothing was helping; I felt completely powerless‚Ä¶and then‚Ä¶rage quit.  Amidst the guilt, confusion and shame, I decided to sit down and actually read through all those glowing reviews; what was I missing here? And then I finally noticed it, that dreaded word: tactical. I do not play tactical RPG‚Äôs, never have, assumed I never would, and was unprepared for what I was experiencing here. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt play tactical games, but I like to keep my genres separate, and was clearly not expecting this.  I play games for different reasons. Some for immersion, others for adrenaline, mental stimulation, relaxation, storytelling, etc. For me, RPG‚Äôs equal immersion; that‚Äôs what I expect, why I play them. The acts of becoming a character, building them up, leading them through decisions and adventures, customizing them, engaging in their world, these are creative acts. Tactics, on the other hand, are left-brained; strategy; detached, clinical, chess-like, requiring a different mindset. When I crave that, I‚Äôll play a strategy game. But to combine the two is counter to what I want from a role playing experience.  So, after hours of trying really hard to like this game, only to die repeatedly in the process, I had officially given up. This simply wasn‚Äôt for me. Just as I was about to uninstall, though, something happened, and to this day I still don‚Äôt know what it was. For some mysterious reason, I decided to launch DOS2 one last time. I began to play, I mean really play. By the time I finally escaped Fort Joy, I realized something: this game is getting better; a LOT better. And my negative review? Well, suddenly it was becoming a positive one.  It was still no cake-walk, but my feelings began to change when I altered my play style. Up to then I had been approaching it as any other RPG; and it finally sunk in that I simply can‚Äôt do that. I couldn‚Äôt run blindly into battles, dash wildly about the landscape, race through dialogue; instead I had to slow down, take nothing for granted, become obsessed with details. I also had to redefine what it meant to lose. I had to go into each fight knowing my characters wouldn‚Äôt survive, instead using the chance to study the enemies, how they play, how I react, and how it all unfolds, so when I reload, I can play the fight ‚Äúfor real‚Äù and have a plan in mind. This meant that I had to play most battles upwards of half a dozen times before I got it right; but when things did click into place, it was a beautiful feeling.  Still, I do have a few remaining criticisms, the biggest being the quest and map design. Confusing, unforgiving, unhelpful, oblique, unfair‚Ä¶are but a few of the words I‚Äôd use to describe them. Simply put, it‚Äôs just way too easy to stumble into things you‚Äôre not ready for. As for the quests, dialogues and journal entries are misleading, key information is frequently given out of order, or omitted altogether, way too may red-herrings, and the supposed freedom to tackle a quest multiple ways doesn‚Äôt work if you dare to do things out of order. If you‚Äôre looking for guidance, look to Google, for you will find none in-game. People might tout this as a feature: it doesn‚Äôt hold your hand, they cheer. Indeed. There is no hand-holding, which would be fine if the quest design didn‚Äôt keep tripping over its own two feet.  The map layout is so cluttered and dense that basically each and every pixel is trying to kill you. At first I felt this was infuriatingly random; after a while I did start to pick up on the clues, and was able to avoid such missteps, but it was a lesson learned the hard way. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this, but I‚Äôm used to other games which balance the levels with your current abilities; you can freely wander where you‚Äôre likely to survive, and prevented from getting in over your head. But DOS2 is more than happy to let you get in over your head. The key is to recognize your own limits, knowing the game won‚Äôt do it for you.  As far as audio/visual design, this is single-handedly some of the best art-direction I‚Äôve seen in a game. The detail given to the environments is so rich that the world feels alive in ways that other games could only dream of. Rivellon is LIVED IN; it exists, it‚Äôs lush, and rich in the most unexpected ways. By comparison, all other RPG worlds feel dead, like stage sets populated by mere mannequins. Every square inch of DOS2 is simply bursting with life. The audio is top notch too. I just love the soundtrack. Works brilliantly in game, and is great outside as well. The voices are an absolute treat, too. I don‚Äôt know where they found these actors, but their delivery is infectious. The dialogue is already good, but you can tell how much they really dug their characters, the way they rolled the words around and added such flavor to the lines, making each and every one, from the biggest hero down to the lowest fish monger, feel 100% unique. Seriously, is there an award for best video game ensemble performance?  Regarding immersion, even after coming to terms with a tactical RPG, I was never able to feel that I was part of the world of Rivellon, or that the character I was playing was really me, or that the decisions I made mattered. The story didn‚Äôt haunt me between gaming sessions, I can barely remember most of it now, to be honest. And yet, I‚Äôve had so many individual experiences, so many moments that feel were hand-crafted just for me, so many surprises (both by what I could get away with, and just how flexible the game mechanics really are), that I do feel an emotional, as well as intellectual, connection. This game has given me memories of frustration, true, but also memories of joy, surprise, amazement, wonderment, suspense, excitement, and mischievousness. In spite of the many miraculous accomplishments of this game, it is for these memories that I thank Larian the most.  So now we‚Äôve arrived. That‚Äôs how a sternly negative review, over the course of a few hundred unexpected hours of play, morphed into a shout of praise for what very well might be one of the best RPG‚Äôs ever‚Ä¶even if it is tactical.  But one question remains: what on earth possessed me to keep playing, after I had given up for what I thought was the final time? Was it that I felt goaded into continuing by reading all the other glowing reviews? Perhaps. Was it guilt, that somehow I was missing out on something great? Maybe. Was it stubbornness, since I paid full price, I might as well force myself to enjoy the darn thing? Possibly. All of these things could be true, and could be what drew me back in to the world of Rivellon. It could be. But really‚Ä¶really, I think I did it for the cat."

( I will update this review when I've played trough the full release of the game)  The developers are really listening to their community and even ask them what to improve, what to add/remove.  I've not that many hours in it yet since I don't want to play through act 1 yet (which is the early acces part) until I can play the entire story.  Some keyfeatures I like so far are: * Great storytelling * You can interact with ALL npc (and there are a lot of NPC) * Crafting * Wide choice of reactions in conversations * Multipe characters to pick from with their own story line * Split Screen co-op * 4 Player Drop in-out Co-op (multiplayer) * Deep tactical combat * Secret locations and treasures  Upcoming things I'm very excited about are: (these will be added on launch)  * You can play Undead as any race you like(!) * Fully voiceacted game * Skill/Spell crafting   The thing I'm also very excited about (and if you are a DnD player you should be aswell) is the DM mode. This will make it possible for DM's to play their campaigns in this game with: * worldmaps you can pick from a list or upload one yourself. * pick one of the premade playabble area's or even better create one yourself * map editor for Divinity Original Sin 2 * Support for up to 4 players and a DM * And they even have the Lost Mines of Phandelver (DnD starterpack) availible for play on launchday!

Alas, a time of great darkness followed, and hither came the likes of Dragon Age 2 and Fallout 4, from whence there was little 'role-playing' and simply 'game' in its stead.  Bethesda and Bioware did cheer as they drowned in coin, but the 'R in the 'RPG' was thought lost forever, and the faithful seemed eternally doomed to walk the path of 'action adventures with skills trees but really you just have to murder everything',   'You don't need any of that old beardy old RPG nonsense' Dragin Age Inquisition cried.  'You need bland worlds of endless icons and fetch-questing between awkward digital sex scenes with elven waifus.  You won't have time for meaningful dialogue choices or stats that effect anything other than combat, not when there are farmers who need you to find lost sheep or villagers who need you to go into the forest and bring back10 rumpleberry leaves'.  All was thought lost...   But hark!  the Bespeckled Ones did hear thine prayer!  'A skill-tree doth not an RPG maketh!' cried Larian, and Divinity Original Sin did emerge from the darkenss, and it was good.  It was bloody good. It giveth from the fruits of meaningful dialogue, choices and actions with consequences, stats and character building that actually matter the game, and it blessed with the freedom to solve problems and quests in any way you could figure out.  And in the later years, Larian did beget Divinity Original Sin 2, and it was even better than the first in almost every way imaginable.  More complex, more engaging, more consequential to the players actions, better written, more co opy then before, just more in everyway!  And the faithful did rejoice! Multiple playthroughs were planned, and marriges and careers thrown to the wayside!  It was the RPG we all wanted...  The Bespeckled Ones have not forsaken us.   (FYI this is just a bit of a laugh.  DOS2 is brilliant - get it)"

zanos,300,3,0,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,102.0,"Wow, where do I begin...  This game harkens back to a time long past, a time of unforgiving games that don't hold your hand,  and offers you pithy clues to make your way through a vast uncompromising land replete with challenging combat, the odd puzzle, and a myriad of ways to deal with a situation rather than selecting an option through a chat box.   There were so many instances during my playthrough where I felt like I was breaking quests only to see them to completion in ways that would have involved a reload in others.  It's a game that stands on some firm philosophical foundations: questioning the nature of power, the idea of power corrupting or the good that can be done if consolidated. It explores the nature of institutions in a world gone awry, exemplifying the idea that the road to hell is most certainly paved with good intentions. The moral dilemmas are many, and in an almost Witcheresque fashion, the consequences of actions taken often come with a cost.  That being said, Larian is able to balance the seriousness of the subject with the humor, sarcasm, and satire that they are known for and given the gravity of the events unfolding, the humor adds an extra dimension to the game.  The combat is as challenging as you want it to be. I don't mean in terms of a difficulty slider, I mean in terms of scouring the forums for optimal builds or cheesing for gold to get the best possible equipment. I don't condemn either, I found it rather refreshing that the satisfaction of combat is as customizable as you want it to be depending on how one chooses to engage in a situation. Do you use environmental barrels? Reposition before engaging the situation? Run in and make do? Some of these will work, others will not, but what is interesting is that the solutions to these situations are many and are at the discretion of the player.  The companions you can choose all have excellent backgrounds, some more interesting than others, but all of them were noteworthy. What is also interesting about it is that they are not just there for you, like in most RPGs, they have their own ambitions, goals, and desires and often time going at odds with them could cost you a slot on your roster.   The quests and the world itself are amazing, especially the latter. It's not perfect, and you can clearly see some additional attention was given to certain areas of the game over others, but the different areas, the choices made, and consequences really strengthen the overall story and your journey from a prisoner in Fort Joy to its aftermath.   The quests, in typical Larian fashion, run the gamut. They vary from discovering a serial killer to the occasional rescue to providing an item or eliminating a threat. They are pretty standard fare, but what is interesting is how many different ways you can handle them and the consequences of handling them in the way that you do. There have been bugs with journal entries, and sometimes quests can seem rather baffling, but I didn't really let that upset me. I have no doubt that in the coming months they will be fixed and tightened up. But yeah, to some, and to me at times, it was frustrating.  All in all, this was an excellent game. Perhaps that isn't the right word, it was better than excellent. It was not without its faults, but I really got a lot out of it, from the story, to the challenging combat, the voice acting, the perks and quirks of communing with animals, the different ways to tackle each situation and even the soundtrack. It's a tightly knit rich and rewarding game that you savor long after it ends and even into the beginning of the next playthrough.    If you like CRPGs, you will most likely really see this as a worthy successor to the Fallout 2 style of CRPGs. People have been comparing it to Baldur's Gate 2, and, in terms of the story, companions, and the epic nature of the experience, you can definitely draw comparisons, but the combat is firmly rooted in the Fallout 2 or Temple of Elemental Evil tradition.  So, yeah, Larian does it again, even better than before. I expected a good game, even a great game, but I was not expecting this. It will be penned into the great book of RPG goodness that it deserves. Larian firmly deserves every bit of success they get from this title.   They have stolen the divinity from the former greats and it is perhaps only contested for the crown, in my opinion, by CDPR. Obsidian is also up there, but POE, even in all of its greatness, failed to evoke the same feelings that I had for this. It really filled the void left for me by the Witcher 3, and for those of you that know what I'm talking about and perhaps for those of you reading these reviews to see if it's a worthwhile purchase...it is.  Good luck in your future endeavors Larian, I, for one, will be there to continue to back your projects henceforth, bien fait."

There is pure choice in this game and how you progress through the story, while most only give you the illusion of choice(fallout4).

I hate how amazingly detailed the story is, I hate how This whoel game takes you on an emotional roller coaster of wonder, tragedy, and awe.I hate how complex and interesting the fighting system is, how beautiful the graphics are, and how you can customize your character to give them whatever backstory interests you. I hate how rewarding the game is when you complete a quest; Overthrow and assassinate a corrupt world leader? Fight a giant purple worm? Slay an evil witch to free and befriend a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing DRAGON?! ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. YES. THAT IS AWESOME. This is not even end game stuff, I've only gotten to the 2nd area.   I hate this game because it is ruining my life by being so addictive I'd rather retrace my 2.5 hours of gameplay due to not saving than to get off my‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•and do homework. AND this is only the single player experience. Buy this game NOW if you've ever liked a game even remotely similar to this one. D&D, WoW (or any MMORPG), any action RPG like Diablo or Path of Exile, or just fastasy games in general. Solid 9/10 discounting their ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• save system. So just REMEMBER TO SAVE AFTER EVERY FIGHT, THEY WON'T SAVE YOUR GAME FOR YOU, SERIOUSLY THIS IS THE ONLY BAD THING IN THE GAME.   Ok, I'm done. The rest is for the Devs. I love your game, just make it so I can live my life and play your game too. 9/10.   Dear Larian Studios,  You've got to get your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•together. I have lost and retraced at least 10-12 hours of my 50 hours of gameplay due to forgetting that this game only quicksaves every blue moon. I understand that there are settings and sliders to determine when saves happen, but either I'm a complete dunce or that system is confusing. ALSO, QUICKSAVE BEFORE FIGHTS HAPPEN. I don't care if they spoil the surprise, just... At the beginning of a hostile area, or whenever you're about to talk to someone who's supposed to kill you, please help a bro out so they don't have to redo their search for source, resurrection scrolls AND two long‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•fight scenes.   Your game is a work of art and I haven't even got out of the hollow marshes yet. Would be a 10/10 if the saves didn't ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me over so often."

Even just looking around will have you waste hours thanks to breathtaking environment.   Where there is good there must be bad. The bad thing about this game is the closer you get to the ending the more you want to start over. Nobody wants this game to end.

Darkhollow,264,3,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,146.3,"I would like to preface some things before I start my review: I have been a fan of Larian and their Divine Divinity games since the first game in the series that came out in 2002.  It has taken me 145 hours to complete Divinity Original Sin 2 and I just want to say that it was one of the best CRPG experiences that I have had since I finished Planescape Torment (for the first time) back in 2013.   Now onto the  Pro and Cons followed by my final thoughts.  Pro:   - Interesting story & interesting party members with choice & consequences - Amazing soundtrack - Great replayability (multiple endings, different classes & origins to pursue) - All dialogue is fully voiced (major props to Larian for taking the huge undertaking on fully voicing every line of dialogue in the game) - Robust crafting system - Interactive open world gameplay (picking up objects and moving them around to your advantage or to plan strategies) - Robust character & class customization with the option of respeccing  Cons:  - Optimization issues mainly in the second half of the game/later acts (solved via patches) - Some bugged quests that don't complete properly or don't trigger (solved via patches) - No search item bar option in the inventory for specific items (quality of life improvement)   Conclusion: The sheer amount of content and replayability that you get from this game is staggering and I cannot fathom how Larian have managed to create such an amazing game in such a short span of time (2 years).   I would like to thank Larian and everyone involved including the Kickstarter backers help create this masterpiece. The praise it has received from numerous gaming outlets is well deserved.  Now...do I recommend this game? This is one of those games that shouldn't be missed, because it's one of the best CRPG's ever created and if you have any incling of trying a turn based RPG then I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this game is worth your money."

In the same spirit of games like Baldur's Gate, this game stands out as one of the best RPG's I've played since Witcher 3. I'd easily rank this one right behind Witcher 3 as one of the two best RPG's I've played.  Good: Story with immersive choices, influenced by character, class and background choices ontop of gameplay choices. Rich world with a huge amount of things to do. Meaningful choices, where perks, traits and so on actually have an impact on how you play and even how the story goes. Very high replayability, thanks to all the above. Very pretty to look at and runs excellently.  Bad: Very slow pace, but it's due to the fact that there is so much to do, so much to take in and consider as you progress. Combat can take a long time. Boss fights especially can take a very long time.   Even on the supposed Explorer difficulty mode, I had characters die horribly in combat. I feel that even though this difficulty is meant to be very easy, that it isn't and is still a bit of a challenge. So I can't imagine what the normal difficulty is like.  Some minor spelling errors, but this is EA version so those might be corrected in the full version.  Could be bad, but also good:  Combat can be difficult. You may often need to reload to try a different approach to a fight or to avoid it entirely until you're better prepared. You may progress too quickly into new areas of the game.  There is a TON of dialogue, so if you're the type of person who is impatient and doesn't like reading you might struggle with this game as it's important to read the dialogue.  The deep combat system that involves combining different conditions, applying them correctly, countering them and so on takes a bit of learning but can also make fights drag on.

Combat makes great use of abilities and environment. It can be tough but that's part of the fun for me. I think also that it might have a lot of replayability because you can choose a number of different Origin characters who seem to get slightly different story arcs.  Story ... for my taste way better than Original Sin 1 (same goes for most quests). Can't wait to learn more.  Voice acting (Larian originally did not plan to do it) is a great addition and adds a lot to the game. I backed this game on Kickstarter, it was a no-brainer because Larian did great work with Original Sin 1 and is simply a great company, very much in touch with their fans and customers.

MarthaMyDear,47,3,0,"May 25, 2017",Recommended,760.5,"It's still in Alpha, but I have to say Divinity: Original Sin2 is one of the best games I've ever played.  Sorry, I'm a terrible writer, so this isn't much of a review.  If you love RPG games, you'll love this one!  I like it so much, I bought the original Divinity just to give me something to play pending complete game release in September.  Thanks so much Larian Studios.  This is one of the very best Steam purchases I've ever made.   HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  :)  Update 9/17/2017:  Now that game has been officially released, let me add that the voice acting on finished game is great.  Narration and characters voices add a lot and make the game more of a long 'story'.  It's slowing me down because I love listening to every..single..line...which is good because I tend to run through most rpg games too quickly."
Fawlcon,57,3,0,"November 21, 2017",Recommended,"1,427.7","The good:  A very polished game, stunning graphics, voice acting, drop in-out co-op, multiple paths, re-play off the chain.  Game Master is a legitimate contender for Roll20 and like web sites for RPGs. They should try and copy what this game has done, but with more of a D&D rule system.    The bad:  If you like the PC doing the random save versus spells, you will not like the Magic and Physical armor combat.  This is not D&D rules.  Combat will always come down to keeping your armor up while trying to strip the enemies and using a bundle of crowd control to keep them from attacking you. I wish enemies scaled to your level. Example, if you fight hard enemies of superior level early, you will have a great challenge and might have to do multiple re-loads to win‚Ä¶BUT later you go to areas you missed or should have hit earlier and completely walk over the enemies who are of lower level.  The mix:  Once you understand the game mechanics and accept them, you begin to understand how to win battles against superior AI opponents through solid strategy.   The meh: The PC AI is hit or miss.  While there are times the AI does smart counters to your efforts, often it is the AI‚Äôs lack of intelligence that allows you to overcome those odds and cheapens the victory.   I can boast that I finished the game and will likely do multiple runs. Second, I have completed a lavish GM campaign that I will post in the workshop, so I have a complete understanding of the game.  Lastly, I‚Äôve been gaming since pong‚Ä¶need I say more?  Final thought:  If you want to experience everything this game has to offer, it would take multiple play throughs‚Ä¶some might see this as good, while others will see it as just too much an investment.

Absolutely nothing I've very played can top this game in its gravitas. The story is clever and riveting from the beginning to the end, and keeps the player rabidly invested in the development of both the characters and the state of the world. The story is supported masterfully by the (fully voice acted) dialogue, ambient music, and gorgeous art.   The combat in this game just... makes sense. Veterans of RPG games will have no trouble understanding the system, but even newcomers to the genre can pick it up in the space of a few battles. The game's combat continues to throw you curveballs in terms of player and enemy abilities, but they all fit snugly within the bounds of the overarching system. You'll feel like a strategist, unconsciously planning out the best ways to apply your characters' different abilities to best slay enemies with different armour types and quantities.  Divinity is an apt title for this franchise. The gameplay, story, and aesthetics are all worthy of that mantle. I could honestly see this game as a contender for best RPG of all time."

Huge amount of customization and deep combat system.  Keep in mind this game is 1) quite long 2) requires you to read, think, and sometimes retry things a different way, 3) takes a bit to warm up.

I'd definitely recommend hard difficulty for experienced tactical players. On the other hand, the story pulls you in. There are a lot of side quests, puzzles, and mysteries as well.    At the beginning were the predefined characters not that interesting to me, but with time they grew to my heart. And seriously, every single NPC dubbed? With branching conversations? That's every rpg player's dream come true. So be prepared to read a lot too. Or not, that's up to you.    Combat? Feels very fluent and very similar to a combat from the first game. But now some skills can be better combined and create a potential for your cunning. For example: with Hydrosophist and Necromancer you can make Raining Blood - which creates blood surfaces, sets bleeding on enemies and douses fire surfaces - and those blood surfaces you can further electrify or freeze, or simply walk on it with blood sucker for some healing.   Music? Masterpiece by Borislav Slavov.  TL;DR: Like fantasy RPG and tactics? Get your best friends/partners and get it right now! "

Tucan,668,3,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,69.4," Scroll to bottom for summary    To start off, I just want to say that I am really enjoying this game quite a bit. I never played the first one and I decided to take a risk for myself by purchasing this because I have not played many turn-based strategy games that I truly enjoyed/got addicted to in the past.  However  this game has me hooked and at the moment I can't think of hardly any reasons as to why I would stop playing it any time soon.    Ok, but why?    Admittedly this game is definitely not for everyone but hopefully this next part will be helpful to someone who is on the fence about it.    You will likely enjoy this game if you...	  (note: These lists are ordered from the most to least impactful on the experience of the game in each category)   Typically enjoy...     ...combat  	  Turn-Based     Strategy     Co-Op     Party-Based     Tactical  Typically enjoy...     ...Genres	  RPG     Adventure     Fantasy     Open-World  Typically enjoy...     ...Styles/Design Choices	  Story Rich     Character Customization     Atmospheric     Great Soundtrack     Click-to-Move     Isometric/Top-Down (Toggleable by player) If you don't fit into any of the items above then this game probably isn't for you but I would still reccomend that you consider purchasing because as I said earlier, I very rarely enjoy Turn-based strategy games but currently I am enjoying this game a lot.  If based on the things mentioned above you think that you  will  like this game, then below is a list of pros & cons.     Pros  (not in any particular order)     In-Depth Character Customization	 (can be re-customized fairly simply without restarting from the beginging of the game)   Very well polished/detailed level design   Engaging and detailed story	  Vibrant atmospheric environments that each have unique characteristics and/or interesting areas to explore	  Great soundtrack that fits the environments very well	  Multiple ways to solve problems/complete quests	  Rarely uses HUD elements to display your objective (immersive)	  (instead of showing your current objective(s) with the HUD, your quests and assignments are told directly to your character by someone you must find and interact with then your objective is writen down in the journal)   Great NPC character voice acting	  Combat system has a very enjoyable amount of depth and skill required to fully master	  Ability to interact with nearly every item/NPC in the game	  It's very easy to just start playing a co-op game and have fun	  Good veriety of enemies, none of the enemies get overused to the point that they feel repetitive	  High resolution textures and shadows to compliment the beautiful variety of environments	  Cons  (likely that some of these are bugs that will be patched later)     Movement is not as elegant and simple as it could be	 (holding mouse1 or panning to the desired location and clicking)   Using the mouse to pan or rotate the camera is jittery and hard to look at even at very high frame rates	  Friendly AI in combat is poor and can make rescuing a friendly NPC in order to complete a quest feel more like a fight against the game and less like a combat scenario   	  Since there are sometimes very few hints as to where you need to go or who you need to talk to in order to complete a quest it can be frustrating to search an area for an extended period of time simply to complete one objective	  Occasional frame drops or inconsistency of frame times / frame rate in certain areas	  Party members sometimes do not move when the leader is moving until you select a different party member to lead, most commonly when changing elevation via a ladder or vine that leads to a part of the level that is currently on-screen	  Summary:	Divinity: Original Sin 2 can provide countless hours of questing, exploring, adventuring, and monster hunting in it's beautifully designed and expansive open-world with countless areas and secrets to find throughout the entire experience which is glued together by a phenomenal soundtrack and wrapped in a cozy blanket of extrodinary storytelling.   Story     10/10   Graphics     9/10   Gameplay     8/10   Sountrack     10/10   OVERALL 92/100  An absolutely amazing game but I had to take a few points off points for the bothersome movement controls and the friendly AI that tries to kill itself when you are trying to save it."

cowcrusher,173,3,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,162.1,"At 16 hours I had had enough: I HATED this game and logged in to write a scathing review. And yet, 160+ hours later, I‚Äôm on my second playthrough, purchased the previous DOS, and am writing a positive review while listening to the OST. What happened?! This whole misunderstanding started with an impulse purchase and a single, overlooked, very tiny, yet crucial word: tactical.  I had finished a turn based RPG and was in the mood for another, when I saw that DOS2 had just been released. I almost never buy a game at launch, but the trailer looked great, Metacritic boasted a ludicrously high score along with dozens of tasty blurbs, and the whole game had that tantalizing sheen that anything new has. The only negative thing I found at the time was a single review that ranted about rage-quitting the game. Who rage-quits a RPG, I thought at the time?  I took a risk, and was immediately entranced: the character creation was complex and intriguing, the opening story and fight sequences were engaging, everything seemed so promising that I hardly noticed the dreaded word I had overlooked earlier. After a while, however, things took a dark turn for the worse. I kept getting beaten, and beaten badly; my frustration mounted; the world was turning against me; nothing was helping; I felt completely powerless‚Ä¶and then‚Ä¶rage quit.  Amidst the guilt, confusion and shame, I decided to sit down and actually read through all those glowing reviews; what was I missing here? And then I finally noticed it, that dreaded word: tactical. I do not play tactical RPG‚Äôs, never have, assumed I never would, and was unprepared for what I was experiencing here. It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt play tactical games, but I like to keep my genres separate, and was clearly not expecting this.  I play games for different reasons. Some for immersion, others for adrenaline, mental stimulation, relaxation, storytelling, etc. For me, RPG‚Äôs equal immersion; that‚Äôs what I expect, why I play them. The acts of becoming a character, building them up, leading them through decisions and adventures, customizing them, engaging in their world, these are creative acts. Tactics, on the other hand, are left-brained; strategy; detached, clinical, chess-like, requiring a different mindset. When I crave that, I‚Äôll play a strategy game. But to combine the two is counter to what I want from a role playing experience.  So, after hours of trying really hard to like this game, only to die repeatedly in the process, I had officially given up. This simply wasn‚Äôt for me. Just as I was about to uninstall, though, something happened, and to this day I still don‚Äôt know what it was. For some mysterious reason, I decided to launch DOS2 one last time. I began to play, I mean really play. By the time I finally escaped Fort Joy, I realized something: this game is getting better; a LOT better. And my negative review? Well, suddenly it was becoming a positive one.  It was still no cake-walk, but my feelings began to change when I altered my play style. Up to then I had been approaching it as any other RPG; and it finally sunk in that I simply can‚Äôt do that. I couldn‚Äôt run blindly into battles, dash wildly about the landscape, race through dialogue; instead I had to slow down, take nothing for granted, become obsessed with details. I also had to redefine what it meant to lose. I had to go into each fight knowing my characters wouldn‚Äôt survive, instead using the chance to study the enemies, how they play, how I react, and how it all unfolds, so when I reload, I can play the fight ‚Äúfor real‚Äù and have a plan in mind. This meant that I had to play most battles upwards of half a dozen times before I got it right; but when things did click into place, it was a beautiful feeling.  Still, I do have a few remaining criticisms, the biggest being the quest and map design. Confusing, unforgiving, unhelpful, oblique, unfair‚Ä¶are but a few of the words I‚Äôd use to describe them. Simply put, it‚Äôs just way too easy to stumble into things you‚Äôre not ready for. As for the quests, dialogues and journal entries are misleading, key information is frequently given out of order, or omitted altogether, way too may red-herrings, and the supposed freedom to tackle a quest multiple ways doesn‚Äôt work if you dare to do things out of order. If you‚Äôre looking for guidance, look to Google, for you will find none in-game. People might tout this as a feature: it doesn‚Äôt hold your hand, they cheer. Indeed. There is no hand-holding, which would be fine if the quest design didn‚Äôt keep tripping over its own two feet.  The map layout is so cluttered and dense that basically each and every pixel is trying to kill you. At first I felt this was infuriatingly random; after a while I did start to pick up on the clues, and was able to avoid such missteps, but it was a lesson learned the hard way. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with this, but I‚Äôm used to other games which balance the levels with your current abilities; you can freely wander where you‚Äôre likely to survive, and prevented from getting in over your head. But DOS2 is more than happy to let you get in over your head. The key is to recognize your own limits, knowing the game won‚Äôt do it for you.  As far as audio/visual design, this is single-handedly some of the best art-direction I‚Äôve seen in a game. The detail given to the environments is so rich that the world feels alive in ways that other games could only dream of. Rivellon is LIVED IN; it exists, it‚Äôs lush, and rich in the most unexpected ways. By comparison, all other RPG worlds feel dead, like stage sets populated by mere mannequins. Every square inch of DOS2 is simply bursting with life. The audio is top notch too. I just love the soundtrack. Works brilliantly in game, and is great outside as well. The voices are an absolute treat, too. I don‚Äôt know where they found these actors, but their delivery is infectious. The dialogue is already good, but you can tell how much they really dug their characters, the way they rolled the words around and added such flavor to the lines, making each and every one, from the biggest hero down to the lowest fish monger, feel 100% unique. Seriously, is there an award for best video game ensemble performance?  Regarding immersion, even after coming to terms with a tactical RPG, I was never able to feel that I was part of the world of Rivellon, or that the character I was playing was really me, or that the decisions I made mattered. The story didn‚Äôt haunt me between gaming sessions, I can barely remember most of it now, to be honest. And yet, I‚Äôve had so many individual experiences, so many moments that feel were hand-crafted just for me, so many surprises (both by what I could get away with, and just how flexible the game mechanics really are), that I do feel an emotional, as well as intellectual, connection. This game has given me memories of frustration, true, but also memories of joy, surprise, amazement, wonderment, suspense, excitement, and mischievousness. In spite of the many miraculous accomplishments of this game, it is for these memories that I thank Larian the most.  So now we‚Äôve arrived. That‚Äôs how a sternly negative review, over the course of a few hundred unexpected hours of play, morphed into a shout of praise for what very well might be one of the best RPG‚Äôs ever‚Ä¶even if it is tactical.  But one question remains: what on earth possessed me to keep playing, after I had given up for what I thought was the final time? Was it that I felt goaded into continuing by reading all the other glowing reviews? Perhaps. Was it guilt, that somehow I was missing out on something great? Maybe. Was it stubbornness, since I paid full price, I might as well force myself to enjoy the darn thing? Possibly. All of these things could be true, and could be what drew me back in to the world of Rivellon. It could be. But really‚Ä¶really, I think I did it for the cat."

Kite,43,3,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,208.0,"Very addicting game. There are a lot of freedom in the game, the actions of the player will affect how other npcs act towards the player. Voiced dialogues with decriptive narration as if you are reading a book!   The combat is absolutely amazing especially for those of you that love using magic.  Whenever the player use a spell ie. Rain which will cause the area the leave puddles of water. The player can cast various spell on the water affected area for different status effect.  Casting aerotheurge skills on the water will cause electrocutions, casting poison will turn the water into pools of poison then use fire spells on the poison to release explosions!   There are so many ways of playing inside combat.  At first classic mode may be difficult for players that haven't got use to the game mechanics. One big tip is breaking enemies respective armor (physical/magic armor)  different enemies have different amount, some with lower physical and some with lower magical. Now then you'll have to carefully choose the right character to unleash damage on the enemy with physical or magical damage. Once the armor is broken you are free to put status effects on them to make them more vulnerable or simply crowd control them. Split your party before going in combat! And make uses of line of sight, make the enemy use ap on moving,   This game requires you to plan your strategy ahead, laying a spell and think of what that spell will affect for next few turn.   The world is stopping you from using your most powerful magic! But you hunger to unleash your full strength on to the world. Then this game is for you!"

Oblivion#2427,107,3,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,498.3,"8.5/10  A friend of mine told me about this game and said that I should check it out cause I would probably like it. I didn't check for a week but after some more time I took a look. 10 minutes after first checking out the game I bought it and here I am, almost 100 hours in the game.  The game is huge, we played the first act for 20+ hours, and there are 4 acts! The gameplay is very interactive and feels great, you can, for example, create a puddle of acid and set it ablaze!  EVERYTHING is voice acted and the graphics look beautiful. Also the combat system is great for players that like tactical games. Your positioning and skill usage matter a lot, 1 wrong move might cause the end of you.  There's also a ton of replay value due to all the different classes, origin stories and decisions that you make. On top of that there's the Game Master mode where you can create your own campaign or play the ones from others aswell as the workshop which already has a ton of stuff on it.  The only 2 things that I dislike so far is the fact that a few quests have a tendency to bug out making you unable to complete the quest. Also the mages in this game are kinda underwhelming. Physical characters are much more potent. Im hoping they'll take a look into that.  All in all a great game and possibly one of the best rpgs ive played so far. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes to play rpgs and being able to play this game for months to come."
"Ob Nixilis, The Fallen",42,3,0,August 23,Recommended,44.7,"Amazing game. I was turned off my this game at first because it was a top down game with turn-based combat, which I was never previusly a fan of, but Divinity: Original Sin 2 made me fall in love with it. The story is great and it changes so much depending on what choices you make. The RPG elements in this game are awesome, there are so many different types of roles you can do with so many different elements within each role. This game is a must buy for anyone who loves top down RTS game or even for the people who don't like me."

This game is a must, it is plain wonderful on all aspects. I cannot possibly imagine the amount of hours it took to fully design and develop this masterpiece. It is one of those games on Steam that put the others to shame. Can be enjoyed immensely alone and with friends. The music is out of this world."
DoogsHere,105,3,0,January 19,Recommended,96.0,"I. Can't. Stop.  Divinity: Original Sin II is a wonderful game. It pulls you into a great world. The combat system is challenging and rewarding. The game is difficult, and as other reviews mention, the game doesn't hold your hand. I've found myself trying to work through problems, and being unable to do so, having to go to a wiki to find answers, only to curse myself afterwards for not seeing the solution.   Everything is delicately crafted. Above all else, everything is connected. An example of this is  at one point in the campaign you find a red ball. Might as well sell it for a couple of gold, right? I decided to hold onto the ball. A few hours later, I came upon a group of dogs that were looking to fight me. One of the options, that wouldn't have been there otherwise, was to toss the ball to the dogs. I did so and avoided combat. You never know where the connections are, and what you can find to help you with different quests. It makes you want to explore every inch of the game, and to come back later to try things differently after you have more insight and experience.  The replay value is tremendous, and I would say mostly attributed to the classes. There are so many different combinations that you can try, as the game lets you build your character how you want to. I have a solo game with 4 playable characters, and I want to try again with trees that I haven't touched and combinations I haven't thought of.  If you are on the fence, and are at least remotely interested in RPGs, buy this game. I'd also note that the first few hours are the hardest, and most discouraging. I imagine this is where those people that quit, or gave this game negative reviews, gave up. People aren't used to this level of freedom, and lack of hand holding from the developers. Learn about the game, and don't be afraid to start a new game after you've grasped the basics."
Nurse,648,3,0,January 15,Recommended,125.0,"My personal Review to Divinity: Original Sin 2 So, lets get this straight, this game is a master-piece.   It's a game like XCOM: Enemy Unkown its a game like The Witcher its a game like Dragon Age and many more...  Divinity is not for everyone, but it is for everyone who loves MMO/RPG/TBG Turn based game I try to be spoiler free, but i will include stuff in this review that is obvious.  Character Editor There are a few thing's that i want to talk about, mostly good. You can create your own char in this game, and it's not only for the look, it changes the gameplay for the entire game. There are a few races, Human's, Lizard's, Drawf's, Skeleton's, Elf's... Every Race has a unique talent, example: Elf's can eat body Part's and know what happened to them or what they thought about while they died, sound strange? Yes it is. But it help's you in-game to find hidden treasures or hidden quest's. Even the NPC's are reacting to your Gender/Race/Behavior.  You can choose your own Style, i dont mean hair, face, etc. i mean... how your char is reacting to things... example: I mad a Noble Lizard, that talk's like it has a stick up her‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I role-play her like she is a Annoying know-it-all.  This way, your story takes different out comes. So watch out what you pick.  The only thing that bugs me is, that i cant change how tall my char is, how the body looks... Also, some gear looks weird on the body of the chars, they look more fat in some of these, and some are way to skimpy.  There are also many trait's and Skills you can pick but thats too much to go in to... You just need to know one think... there is everything from the normal knight to cleric.  This might be a spoiler for an enemy in the game: Some races has permanent side effects.. like skeletons heal when they get poison damage, same with enemys Martin Looter King What can i say? There is a‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•tone of loot... i dont know how much and how different they are, but what i saw so far... simply -amazing-  I just noticed, here and there, some clothing and loot looks the same... different item stats, but what will you do with a such big game?  The Trading is very simple to use, easy to access, quick to understand.   Enemy's you face NPC's Sadly, this is the only point i am slighty disappointed, its not bad for me, but i think some people might notice very quickly, that there are not that many different enemy types. Yes there are plenty, but for the length of this game, it might get boring. I dont mean the fights, i mean the types, i go to the fights after this section...  Oh boy... the NPC's... Where do i start? Simply put, they all are very good written, +1 to the writer's. They never get boring, it feels like every NPC has a story... also, they all are voiced, but sometimes here and there, they dont speak, mostly for stuff like ""YOU THERE! You violated the law! Return your goods or serve your sentence!""  But still, its amazing how much time they put in to the voice acting... and the Narrator... gosh, very good job... you mostly hear his voice, he is describing EVERYTHING you see, smell, feel, do. Its truly amazing.  Sometimes you hear the same voice actor from another person... but this is not a biggy. They did the same in Oblivion, but i dont mind, some people do but not me, a simple little thing.   Multiplayer / Co-op / D&D Mode Alright, lets make this one short, There  is the PvP in alpha/beta, quite fun, then you are able to play the WHOLE Story with 3 others... other player. It's super fun, but i recommend to play with someone you know or to scream at... if you play with randoms... they attack the guard... many... times... its a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Sometimes people dont do that, but many do...  So now to the D&D section, Thats one of the best features the game can offer right next to the single-player. I recommend not to access the Game Master Mode, many spoilers there, enemy types, loot etc.  It's hard to describe, but all you need to know, its like a level editor, or like that one thing from Arma 3 Zeus mode. You can role Dice, you can possess NPC's you can do all kind of‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• But... you need to do all by your self. That means, no NPC's walking around, only you, moving people from A to b. Would be cool if they would add something like a Waypoint/patrol mode so people are walking around citys, taverns etc.   Battles, Fight's, What can you do SO, the main thing in divinity: Original Sin 2 is the battles, fights, etc.  I tried something harder then easy mode - died. You need some training in the beginning but you will find a way to deal with different enemy types and 'areas'.  By Area, i mean... You surrounding. There are some different types of 'things' laying around... Let's talk about the basic of the basic, Fire we all know it, we all hate it. You can ignite Oil with fire, you can throw oil at enemy's, you can burn an enemy and lead him in to a puddle of oil so they explode in a cool way. There are some other thinks like Water and wetness, combined with electricity... just try stuff... its super fun to combine these elements... you can also use magic to make it cursed ;)  My RatingAre there Physic's / Ragdoll in the game? - Yas How big is the map?                                   - Very big, much to explore How are the graphic's?                               - Very nice, smooth pleasent to watch people burn or acid away Fighting?                                                     - Very good, sometimes its too easy, sometimes its too hard, or just ged gud.

A lot... you are not getting bored in this game... Replay potential?                                       - I think you could play this game like 30 times and you still wouldnt find everything in                                                this game, many secrets, many options, combine race/trait's and you will have a different out come Is it buy worthy? Yes! 100% but ONLY when you are a fan of TBG/MMO/RPG's video games. A few games as example:  XCOM: Enemy unknown Dragon Age The Witcher Mass EffectThere are just a hand full of good MMORPG's out there, and if you like turn based combat, then its the perfect game for you, you can waste so many hours in this game, finding the best way to solve problems without fighting. You coudl play this game for a long time just to find out what else is hidden in this game. Gather some friends, play D&D online master the dungeons together. When you search a game with 100% on Metacritics or 10/10 IGN- Would Burn again then... you found it. It cost a lot of money, but its worth it. I think this game was on Kickstarter once too, but just look at it... so much time and effort. If there is a game that's worth the money, it's this one."

Loden DarkStar,312,3,0,September 5,Recommended,119.3,"Divinity has always been a great fantasy IP from the first through the Dragon Knight saga and now in Original Sin.   I am not usually a big fan of turn based combat and that might give people cause to pause when considering this game, it did with me anyway .... dont let that stop you though.   This is a true role playing game something we see so very rarely these days, the turn based mechanic of the combat wont get in your way. In my experance any way the game's turn based mechancis wont adversly impact your enjoyment in any way, if anything you may find you like it if only in this specific case. As to the story, world and characters they are all master strokes through and through, the massive array of options and granular details to game give it huge replayability just in terms of the main campaign and the community have added a lot more via mods and scenarios. Put simply you will get your monies worth out of this game just from the stock content then on top of that you have a great community giving you even more via Workshop and Nexus.  Cons? Nothing really, while the game isn't perfect ... simply because nothing is ... there is nothing I would see changed about it that isn't a matter of personal taste and for thouse aspects of taste the community has that covered in mods e.g. difficulty rebalance, spell effects, rate of progression, etc."

I have never been interested in them, but with all the praise this game has been receiving, I figured I would buy it to try it out. I have been thoroughly impressed with the quality and quantity of the game thus far, especially for the cheaper price tag. The level of complexity with the combat system and crafting is unmatched, I feel like I discover new ways to play the game every few minutes. It can be a difficult game, though that makes it so satisfying when you win a battle. The game doesn't hold your hand, and my friend started out feeling overwhelmed by what we could or couldn't do. The tactical decision making sort of reminds me of Dragon Age: Origins, though more in-depth by far.   Performance is pretty good, there isn't SLI support, though you probably won't need it. The game dropped frames significantly once when surrounded by fire, smoke, gas, and electricity in a high foliage area.   I fully recommend this game if you're even remotely on the fence about it, and I look forward to spending hundreds of hours mastering different classes. The savior of the RPG genre!"

A lot... you are not getting bored in this game... Replay potential?                                       - I think you could play this game like 30 times and you still wouldnt find everything in                                                this game, many secrets, many options, combine race/trait's and you will have a different out come Is it buy worthy? Yes! 100% but ONLY when you are a fan of TBG/MMO/RPG's video games. A few games as example:  XCOM: Enemy unknown Dragon Age The Witcher Mass EffectThere are just a hand full of good MMORPG's out there, and if you like turn based combat, then its the perfect game for you, you can waste so many hours in this game, finding the best way to solve problems without fighting. You coudl play this game for a long time just to find out what else is hidden in this game. Gather some friends, play D&D online master the dungeons together. When you search a game with 100% on Metacritics or 10/10 IGN- Would Burn again then... you found it. It cost a lot of money, but its worth it. I think this game was on Kickstarter once too, but just look at it... so much time and effort. If there is a game that's worth the money, it's this one."

This is THE spritual successor to the Baulder's Gate games that have made their homes in our hearts, some long time ago. Here are reasons I believe this game DESERVES your money:   NO Micro-transactions. Likely, NEVER.    NO Anti-Consumer ""Monetization"" schemes.             NO Bullsh*t.             This game is everything you could want from a game - Epic, honest, and continually nurtured by the devs (Larian Studios).           DEFINITIVE EDITION - An ACTUAL Definitive-level update, FREE for those who already bought it. Worth it for those that haven't yet bought it..   Divine Ascension DLC. It's a high-quality purchase because:    The Original Soundtrack & Score - Contains all 36 (+1 Bonus Song). For you audiophiles: Each song is recorded in a WHOPPING ~1411kbps Bit Rate~ (320kbps is High Quality, so imagine...) Also INCLUDES All 36 songs in FLAC Format as well.            Complete CONCEPT ART of the production of DOS:2 - (Architecture, Artwork, Banners, Characters, Creatures, Cutscenes, Design, Environment, Factions, FX, Items, Map, Nature, Tiles, and Unique)            Complete and Designed ARTBOOKS (Containing obviously the Art of DOS:2) & LOREBOOKS (Containing the knowledge of ALL content and the underlying Storylines - in both: [High Resolution] & [Low Resolution] to meet the need of either enthusiast-grade or budget devices.

An Organic, Living, Breathing Novel.--This game shall walk you through the beauty that is Rivellon - the world of Divinity. I have become attached to the characters that I play, and those whom I've met in passing and in temporary scenarios. I'm even attached to some of the prominent enemies that rival your own character. There are personalities to be had, and so many things that just resonate with me as a human being. I cannot attest to things that would resonate with lizards or other races though, since I'm only a human at the moment. Perhaps later I shall enjoy the proclivites of Lizardry or Gnomery, or Dwarvery, when I have retired my organic life as a human and returned as one of these races. Gosh I have an active imagination... Moving forward.         Mods - Active Modding Community.--There are mods out for the game, so you can make it yours. I use like 10 different mods already, because I do that sort of crap.

Voss,247,3,0,August 23,Recommended,180.7,"If you're a fan of D&D, tremendous attention to detail, an excellent and strategic combat system, the ability to be and do whatever you want (seriously - this can't be exaggerated enough) at your own pace and disgression, and a superb multiplayer/co-op experience (playing with your significant other is recommended)... then you will enjoy this game.    I spent over 100 hours on the starting island of Fort Joy completely f*$#ing around and having a blast.  At one point, I collected/stole basically everything I could and just laughed or nodded in respect at the wordplay/detail in the descriptions of each item.  The people at Larian studios clearly put their heart and soul into this game.  I found such absurd ways to circumvent certain situations that I felt sure I'd broken the game... nope that's just Divinity 2, and it's beautiful how it all works together."

I found some unfinished level / dungeon, sometimes the quests journal are confusing, very minimal hint and sometimes misleading (or is this part of the game?), e.g. the journal says to speak to person A, when I talk to person A, there's no dialogue concerning the matter.  70 hours in, I think the replayability of this game is sooo great, definitely will replay.

seanhogge,93,3,0,January 19,Recommended,97.6,"So you already know the game is good. Very positive reviews overall and recently. The devs are responsive and sensitive to the players, and it's one of the few Kickstarter projects that didn't seem to fall apart or leave everyone underwhelmed.  What I'd like to do is help you figure out what will leave you perfectly whelmed with this game.  TL;DR? It's tough to get into. I failed the first time. Experiment and mod, and you'll have a blast. The game won't keep you from fights way too tough for you. Just learn caution.  I started it maybe 18 months ago, got to the first town and quit in sort-of frustration. I had approached it all wrong. Maybe I can help others avoid the mistake. Here's what you'll need to know, I think.  This is a game of thought. The action is visceral and fun and frequent (unless you prefer it not to be), but even then you'll be most successful when you are deliberate and creative. Don't expect Dragon Age, this is more complex. Battles aren't about the amount of damage, they're about doing the right damage at the right time. You can see the action order, you can see weaknesses, you can chain things together.  The game is a challenge. Levels are significant. 4 level 10s vs 3 level 11s can be a genuinely tough fight when you're still learning mechanics and combos. Quicksave a lot. Just. Like, constantly. Trust me. It's exhilarating that any encounter can go either way, but you can easily get caught with your skivvies in the static cloud.  Don't be afraid to mod, even on your first play through. I came back after a few mods eased some annoyances and made the game slightly easier, but still a challenge. Just do whatever you need to experience the game, and don't listen to the magisters purists. The strength here is in the play, not the mechanical experience.  You can completely respec at any time, starting in Act 2. No mods needed, total freedom to move all your points. The only thing downside is that you'll have to spend money on skills if you go in a new direction. But even in Act 1, don't fret about getting every level-up right. Try wacky things.  Crafting isn't a chore. Once you know a recipe, you can just make it if you have the stuff. You can experiment like a graveyard debtor without penalty. You can ignore crafting altogether.  Leveling up, getting new equipment, and getting new skills all make an impact. All of them happen often enough that I feel like I'm more powerful in almost every fight. A single level opens up many new options. A new weapon is usually around the corner. A new skill is about to be revealed. Relish it, rookie.  Choices make a difference, not in a superficial way. But there's always a way around. Almost. If there isn't, then that's why you and I will have to play through again. I'm only in Act 2, but I already have a half-dozen things I'd like to see go a different way.  You can make mistakes. I killed a guy I needed because he got‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•that I kept asking the same question. So then I had to work around it. It was great. The devs have you, you can't get yourself into an unbeatable state, but ain't no one gonna slay the voidwoken in the closet for you. Also, if you have an undead, always check their coverings or disguise. Just sayin'. Poor townspersons.  Do you like ""gaming the game?"" Figuring out what's overpowered and exploiting it? Go for it! Me, I think that's as boring as a turtle's unrequited love laments, so if you're like me don't read a thing about min-maxing or party makeup. Just pick what you like and you can make it work and the work to do so won't be so bad because it's fun.  If you expect Diablo or Dragon Age, a one-best-way game or mindless distraction, this isn't it. I dig all of those, but this game isn't what I play to scratch those itches.  Oh, and teleport is a crazy useful skill. Make sure at least 1 person has it. FIN."

RedZane,188,3,0,"November 7, 2017",Recommended,503.8,Never done a review but this game has rightfully earned a lot of praise.   I have played through the game entirely on tactian mode and can say this game has earned every bit of praise that people have put. I have spent (probably too many) hours on building a brand new character and running through a good portion on Fort Joy. The whole storyline is a amazing and the interactions between party members is on point.   The only complaint I have is that NPC's treat Fane as human until combat where the begin raining healing spells to his face as if they knew he was undead. Not a huge gripe and something you can generally ignore.

This feels very much like a choose your own adventure game and that you are apart of a living world in a way that most ""open world"" games currently fail to capture.  Here your actions have real game changing consequenses good or bad.  You would probably love this game if you enjoyed any of the following:  D&D,  Mage Knight,  Neverwinter Nights (not the mmo),  X-COM,  Wizardy 1-8.

Darkhollow,264,3,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,146.3,"I would like to preface some things before I start my review: I have been a fan of Larian and their Divine Divinity games since the first game in the series that came out in 2002.  It has taken me 145 hours to complete Divinity Original Sin 2 and I just want to say that it was one of the best CRPG experiences that I have had since I finished Planescape Torment (for the first time) back in 2013.   Now onto the  Pro and Cons followed by my final thoughts.  Pro:   - Interesting story & interesting party members with choice & consequences - Amazing soundtrack - Great replayability (multiple endings, different classes & origins to pursue) - All dialogue is fully voiced (major props to Larian for taking the huge undertaking on fully voicing every line of dialogue in the game) - Robust crafting system - Interactive open world gameplay (picking up objects and moving them around to your advantage or to plan strategies) - Robust character & class customization with the option of respeccing  Cons:  - Optimization issues mainly in the second half of the game/later acts (solved via patches) - Some bugged quests that don't complete properly or don't trigger (solved via patches) - No search item bar option in the inventory for specific items (quality of life improvement)   Conclusion: The sheer amount of content and replayability that you get from this game is staggering and I cannot fathom how Larian have managed to create such an amazing game in such a short span of time (2 years).   I would like to thank Larian and everyone involved including the Kickstarter backers help create this masterpiece. The praise it has received from numerous gaming outlets is well deserved.  Now...do I recommend this game? This is one of those games that shouldn't be missed, because it's one of the best CRPG's ever created and if you have any incling of trying a turn based RPG then I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this game is worth your money."

Skankinpig,59,3,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,36.7,"I'll start by saying i've not played all that far through the story - I've had multiple starts due to purchasing just prior to release and a Co-op partner who seems to enjoy playing several classes before sticking to one.   Interestingly enough, this has had the positive of showing me just how different the game can be with different class combinations. We've played combos where it seems that no matter how careful we are, the battlefield inevitably becomes a blanket of different elemental affects indiscriminately maiming everybody on it and we've had more tactical groups that have more control over such affects, without the volatile power behind their attacks.   We've settled on a slightly more understated group, methodically using status affects to control the flow of battle and tip it into our favour.   The game is beautiful looking, it's as deep as you wish it to be and the sheer amount of detail in the world is amazing. The UI is simple without being restrictive, the game will guide you without holding your hand and through that allows you to make your mistakes, or genius discoveries and whichever it be, you're left with under no illusion: That was your doing, for better or worse.   I always want to like games like this but often find the world doesn't feel alive enough, is to linear or awkwardly open to its own detriment - the balance is never quite right, but here, for me at least it has been struck and i've really enjoyed exploring and experimenting.   tldr:   The game is generally well polished, fun and of good depth. Looks beautiful, with an interesting story and the world feels richer for it. Worth a buy from any RPG fan, especially if like me, an rpg feeling like an MMO with no players in it just feels like an empty experience to you - you wont find that here."

I like it so much, I bought the original Divinity just to give me something to play pending complete game release in September.  Thanks so much Larian Studios.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  :)  Update 9/17/2017:  Now that game has been officially released, let me add that the voice acting on finished game is great.

Divinity is not for everyone, but it is for everyone who loves MMO/RPG/TBG Turn based game I try to be spoiler free, but i will include stuff in this review that is obvious.  Character Editor There are a few thing's that i want to talk about, mostly good. You can create your own char in this game, and it's not only for the look, it changes the gameplay for the entire game. There are a few races, Human's, Lizard's, Drawf's, Skeleton's, Elf's... Every Race has a unique talent, example: Elf's can eat body Part's and know what happened to them or what they thought about while they died, sound strange? Yes it is. But it help's you in-game to find hidden treasures or hidden quest's. Even the NPC's are reacting to your Gender/Race/Behavior.  You can choose your own Style, i dont mean hair, face, etc. i mean... how your char is reacting to things... example: I mad a Noble Lizard, that talk's like it has a stick up her‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I role-play her like she is a Annoying know-it-all.  This way, your story takes different out comes. So watch out what you pick.  The only thing that bugs me is, that i cant change how tall my char is, how the body looks... Also, some gear looks weird on the body of the chars, they look more fat in some of these, and some are way to skimpy.  There are also many trait's and Skills you can pick but thats too much to go in to... You just need to know one think... there is everything from the normal knight to cleric.  This might be a spoiler for an enemy in the game: Some races has permanent side effects.. like skeletons heal when they get poison damage, same with enemys Martin Looter King What can i say? There is a‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•tone of loot... i dont know how much and how different they are, but what i saw so far... simply -amazing-  I just noticed, here and there, some clothing and loot looks the same... different item stats, but what will you do with a such big game?  The Trading is very simple to use, easy to access, quick to understand.   Enemy's you face NPC's Sadly, this is the only point i am slighty disappointed, its not bad for me, but i think some people might notice very quickly, that there are not that many different enemy types. Yes there are plenty, but for the length of this game, it might get boring. I dont mean the fights, i mean the types, i go to the fights after this section...  Oh boy... the NPC's... Where do i start? Simply put, they all are very good written, +1 to the writer's. They never get boring, it feels like every NPC has a story... also, they all are voiced, but sometimes here and there, they dont speak, mostly for stuff like ""YOU THERE! You violated the law! Return your goods or serve your sentence!""  But still, its amazing how much time they put in to the voice acting... and the Narrator... gosh, very good job... you mostly hear his voice, he is describing EVERYTHING you see, smell, feel, do. Its truly amazing.  Sometimes you hear the same voice actor from another person... but this is not a biggy. They did the same in Oblivion, but i dont mind, some people do but not me, a simple little thing.   Multiplayer / Co-op / D&D Mode Alright, lets make this one short, There  is the PvP in alpha/beta, quite fun, then you are able to play the WHOLE Story with 3 others... other player. It's super fun, but i recommend to play with someone you know or to scream at... if you play with randoms... they attack the guard... many... times... its a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Sometimes people dont do that, but many do...  So now to the D&D section, Thats one of the best features the game can offer right next to the single-player. I recommend not to access the Game Master Mode, many spoilers there, enemy types, loot etc.  It's hard to describe, but all you need to know, its like a level editor, or like that one thing from Arma 3 Zeus mode. You can role Dice, you can possess NPC's you can do all kind of‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• But... you need to do all by your self. That means, no NPC's walking around, only you, moving people from A to b. Would be cool if they would add something like a Waypoint/patrol mode so people are walking around citys, taverns etc.   Battles, Fight's, What can you do SO, the main thing in divinity: Original Sin 2 is the battles, fights, etc.  I tried something harder then easy mode - died. You need some training in the beginning but you will find a way to deal with different enemy types and 'areas'.  By Area, i mean... You surrounding. There are some different types of 'things' laying around... Let's talk about the basic of the basic, Fire we all know it, we all hate it. You can ignite Oil with fire, you can throw oil at enemy's, you can burn an enemy and lead him in to a puddle of oil so they explode in a cool way. There are some other thinks like Water and wetness, combined with electricity... just try stuff... its super fun to combine these elements... you can also use magic to make it cursed ;)  My RatingAre there Physic's / Ragdoll in the game? - Yas How big is the map?                                   - Very big, much to explore How are the graphic's?                               - Very nice, smooth pleasent to watch people burn or acid away Fighting?                                                     - Very good, sometimes its too easy, sometimes its too hard, or just ged gud. Multiplayer?                                                - Everything works good, no disconnect stuff or lagging. Plenty of people are                                                                         playing this game Stuff to do?                                                 - Yas... A lot... you are not getting bored in this game... Replay potential?                                       - I think you could play this game like 30 times and you still wouldnt find everything in                                                this game, many secrets, many options, combine race/trait's and you will have a different out come Is it buy worthy? Yes! 100% but ONLY when you are a fan of TBG/MMO/RPG's video games. A few games as example:  XCOM: Enemy unknown Dragon Age The Witcher Mass EffectThere are just a hand full of good MMORPG's out there, and if you like turn based combat, then its the perfect game for you, you can waste so many hours in this game, finding the best way to solve problems without fighting. You coudl play this game for a long time just to find out what else is hidden in this game. Gather some friends, play D&D online master the dungeons together. When you search a game with 100% on Metacritics or 10/10 IGN- Would Burn again then... you found it. It cost a lot of money, but its worth it. I think this game was on Kickstarter once too, but just look at it... so much time and effort. If there is a game that's worth the money, it's this one."
DeedWalker,591,3,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,127.2,"Definitely must play if you love RPG genre, it even have GM mode for your digital DnD experience"
JimDaddy,56,3,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,72.4,"Just bought this a couple days ago after alot of hesitation (I haven't played an Iso RPG since Diablo 1 like 18 years ago, thus the hesitation). Love it. Been playing it non-stop and I can't wait to start over on the 14th with all I've learned!"
Ponto,178,3,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,115.0,an excellent game and a worthy successor of the previous Divinity Original Sin game. well worth the price if you are into turnbased strategies / RPGs
J.C Staff is G.o.a.t,60,3,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,157.5,"As expected from larian, another very well done RPG game. Although the ending is slightly underwhelming and i kinda disappointed that D:OS 2 doesn't have free roam mode after you finished the story.  9/10 for me"
DARKSIGNAL,48,3,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,77.4,"Pure RPG Perfection.  This is an RPG in the truest form. Let me be clear, this game doesn't do any hand holding. From the character creation to party selection, you are really writing your own story. The combat is the most entertaining turn based system I have ever played. Your enemies will be very tough encounters but every encounter teaches you how to use your parties skills and the terrain to your advantage and you eventually start to win. Winning a fight in this game feels very very rewarding. If you loved the RPG's of old but want to experience them in a modern, compelling way in 2017, there is simply no better experience than Divinity: Original Sin 2  9.5/10"
Tatterwing,182,3,0,"October 28, 2017",Recommended,187.4,"I am positively enthralled by the rich and vibrant lore that the dev team has created for this continuation of the Divinity series!  The mechanics and class creation have created an absolute eden of possibilities, while the world surrounding you ~ dark and treacherous ~ has such a wonderful and vast open canvas of opportunity."

Hydra Bite,205,3,0,"October 1, 2017",Recommended,73.6,"Great game, but still dumb mechanics in combat that cause it to be broken.  Anyways, amazing game, Long story, kinda one time play through, but is the best virtual game to duplicate a TableTop RPG.  They designed it perfectly for how players want to play. With dual co-op locally, and 4 player coop online, and any mixture of the two.  Along with Dungeon master capablilty, and steam  ----needs to be fixed in these areas. If you want to play lonewolf, you will without a doubt lose and have a disadvantage later in the game from fighting events that are designed for losing turns..... THATS the problem needing to be addressed... WHY are there so many freaking lost turns in this game. Stunned makes sense, Feared, is okay. Why is knocked down the same as stunned. That destroys LoneWolfs chance and bonus, you need more members to counter lost turn CC. Why isnt it 2AP to stand up from knockdown?  And p.s.( summons is the op thing right now)"

Krystallias,20,3,0,March 25,Recommended,39.2,"I absolutely love this game. I am impressed by the graphics, the storyline and the vast choice of characters you get to choose from. Playing as an Elf character and choosing your own unique abilities etc, really make my character stand out in Divinity. The music is just awesome too and it really ties in along the way. The gameplay is absolutely perfect, both as solo and multiplayer."
Gerre,272,3,0,"November 19, 2017",Recommended,124.5,"Great RPG with outstanding writing, tactical turn-based combat and a nice soundtrack. During combat the terrain can be altered by creating various elemental surfaces. It's also possible to combine different elements (e.g. water can be electrified or frozen, oil can be burned)."
RB,239,3,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,259.3,"A wild ride that, like some of the best books I've read, I could not put down. The world is detailed both in environment and lore, the characters are deep and nuanced, often troubled and frequently broken, yet richer for their vast flaws. The combat is pure turn based strategy, and while cheesable, can be quite difficult while rewarding smart tactics.  The story is enthralling, as are each of the dozens of side stories. I'm hesitant to label them quests, as I feel that would demean their stature in some way.  Finally, the sound track is amazing. So good in fact, that it won't stop playing on loop in my head, even when I wish it would because I've been up for 46 hours and please let me sleep.  10/10, will play again once I can convince a friend to get the game for a co-op playthrough."

Spent 17 hours murdering the entire city, clearing out the magisters, and at the end I got to kill some void worm. However it is a little bit buggy, as at the end I got my friend to talk to the final boss while I positioned myself, teleported the ranger and initiated combat on everyone except the guy my friend was talking to. Would be great to see this fixed once they introduce more monsters to kill so you can gain a higher level before fighting this boss, otherwise it is extremely hard, unless I missed something. Other than that, it is a great game for what it currently is. I look forward to seeing it progress further."
Loden DarkStar,312,3,0,September 5,Recommended,119.3,"Divinity has always been a great fantasy IP from the first through the Dragon Knight saga and now in Original Sin.   I am not usually a big fan of turn based combat and that might give people cause to pause when considering this game, it did with me anyway .... dont let that stop you though.   This is a true role playing game something we see so very rarely these days, the turn based mechanic of the combat wont get in your way. In my experance any way the game's turn based mechancis wont adversly impact your enjoyment in any way, if anything you may find you like it if only in this specific case. As to the story, world and characters they are all master strokes through and through, the massive array of options and granular details to game give it huge replayability just in terms of the main campaign and the community have added a lot more via mods and scenarios. Put simply you will get your monies worth out of this game just from the stock content then on top of that you have a great community giving you even more via Workshop and Nexus.  Cons? Nothing really, while the game isn't perfect ... simply because nothing is ... there is nothing I would see changed about it that isn't a matter of personal taste and for thouse aspects of taste the community has that covered in mods e.g. difficulty rebalance, spell effects, rate of progression, etc."

It has near endless replayability. Great music and gameplay. Although it was overwhelming for me I had to start in explorer mode(easiest diffculty) if your new i suggest you try it to get a feel for the game, after that I'm trying tactican.  It has great companions and memorable enemies and npcs(You can even romance certain people/companions), the game gives you so much player choice its a breath of fresh air, But its always more fun when you have someone else to play it with so feel free to add me :D"

Effigy,346,3,0,"October 11, 2017",Recommended,150.5,"I've played all the games in the Divinity series several times over, I'm a fan of their work so, it's possible that my review is not entirely objective. Because Original Sin was such an amazing game, I've followed the progress of its successor's development and watched how Larian, with the help of the community, turned Original Sin 2 into an even better game.  The freedom you have in Original Sin 2 while exploring and the way you're progressing through the game is some of the best I've seen. It gave me mixed feelings of excitement and nostalgia which, at times, made me forget that I'm in the year 2017, and feel the same way that I did while playing Torment or Fallout. It felt new and enticing, the areas are varied and the content is hidden behind actually talking with people or having to read stuff to know what to do. You can mess up and miss out on quests if you kill people and your actions have consequences, I know, I killed everyone in a playtrough. NPC's are not immortal just because they have a generic quest attached to them.  If you're unsure on whether to purchase the game or not, I'll try to help.  PROS: - Varied, visual detailed and beautiful areas. No recycled content (like Generic caves 1 to 40 in Dragon Age 2); - Detailed origin stories that have an effect over multiple encounters in the game; - Fully and adequately voice acted(Apart from 1-2 encounters); - Lots of class combinations and spell interactions; - Extremely satisfying combat; - Level-dependent loot system; - Loads of exploration; - Puzzles; - A plethora of quests, fun ones; - Excellent writing; - Interesting and useful crafting system; - Actions/Consequences; - You can follow your own path and still achieve the endgame; - It does not have the price of an AAA title, it's only 45 euros and offers far more content than its competitors.  CONS:  - In the first few days the game seemed a bit rushed, there's still room for improvements/optimizations; - Using more resources than Mass Effect: Andromeda/ The Witcher 3 on Ultra seems a bit of an overkill; - Found a few placeholder items and unfinished areas; - Difficulties do not make enemies smarter or, at least, they don't appear to be doing it. It's just hp/armor/damage multiplier; - Entire difficult fights can be won instantly; - Sending items to party members is not proximity based; - Pruned talent trees compared to Original Sin;  Few of Today's companies have the dedication and experience to release a polished and entertaining product that offers huge amounts of content at such a low cost. Well, Larian did it. They released decent content in the past but their latest games have shown a huge level of interest in their users, the feedback they provide and they genuinely seemed to care about their work. I can't wait for your next game, keep up the good work guys!  "

Several years later and Larian Studios have done just what I hoped they would, making a sequel that retains the strengths of previous game while addressing just about every issue I had with it, and then going even further with additions like full voice acting, something not generally found in the recent wave of cRPG games. Due to the relatively high difficulty and patience required it may still not be for everybody, but Divinity: Original Sin 2 is very much at the pinnacle of the sub-genre and will no doubt prove intoxicating for those who get trapped in its spell.   continue reading [www.newgamenetwork.com] "

Almost perfect in every aspect and way better than its already amazing prequel (except that I feel I prefer the voice and atmosphere of the female narrator in DOS:EE than that of this male narrator.)  Special reference must be made to the music for it is so astoundingly composed that I feel I can just sit there listening to the main theme for hours. Last time a game‚Äôs BGM would give me such immersion and pleasure should be playing Skyrim.  Larian Studios now officially tops my favorite developer list and this honor should only be shared by CD Projekt Red. These two great studios earn their greatness not only because they make great games, but because the enthusiasm and true love they showed to their works: they try wholeheartedly to polish and perfect their games in every possible way and they always take the players seriously.   I sincerely hope DOS2 will be a great success and cement Larian Studios‚Äô ascension to an AAA studio (if it is not already in that list). For this reason I feel real sad for some recklessly given negative ratings: it‚Äôs a shame not to show your respect and kindness to such a devoted developer that does not care only about profit maximization as many others do.

I wouldn't expect skyrim level modding, but there's a ton of potential for gameplay overhauls and new content, never mind a possibly revolutionary game master mode, if that sort of thing compells you to buy a game. Many of the criticisms regarding balance and difficulty could be solved by modders in the first couple months. Heck, many aspects of the game are already moddable, though obviously it'd be a bit silly to mod an alpha.  Barring a large drop in quality in the later acts (extremely unlikely), this will probably be an instant classic with amazing RPG gameplay that far surpasses its predecessor in narrative quality.  I will say Larian could be a bit more generous with more skills for us to play with in the alpha, but let me tell you, from what I've seen, there are going to be a LOT more cool skills in the final release. ;) "

Invest in this game and let the times pass, it will be next year before you know it. Before I forget it, this game can even be played in co-op (up to 4 players), what else do you need (maybe some beer, chips and a girlfriend, but that's not important now) For d&d fans they even implemented a game master mode (with one d&d campaign already worked out for your party!) to make sure you will never ever have to play the same story.

@Neiffarious,236,4,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,57.6,"So my brother and I played through most of the first act. I'm not saying that we got through most of the content because I'm sure there is stuff we missed out on for whatever reason. Playing through the first act was very exciting. Although I must admit it started out a little bit slowly, but i feel like a lot of games in this genre can have kind of a slow start, in part because there is so much to do you might feel overwhelmed.  I'm not going to get into great detail about any of this, i'm not professional reviewer, but I'm going to adress some things that are pretty important to me when deciding whether or not to buy a game:  Is it worth getting this game in early access? - In my opinion, as a big fan of this genre, yes There is probably 10-13 hours of content if you try to do EVERYTHING. More content to be added such as New playable undead race, more origin stories, new areas to explore etc. There is so much content coming and so much that I missed out on as well. there are a few bugs. keep that in mind.   How is it mechanically to the first Original Sin? - A drastically better inventory system, skill system seems to be much deeper, and there is a bit more variety in ways to play as each skill point provides some kind of bonus besides just allowing you to use higher level skills IE: Necromancy gives you lifesteal, or Hunstman reduces the penalty for firing from low ground gives a bonus for attacking from high ground etc. etc.  Bugs?  - Yes, a few that really stuck out: Blank Conversation boxes that require a reload to escape from, quests unable to be complete even with all the items in your inventory, and smaller ones like ressurecting a character but instead of standing up they slide around the ground. These kinds of things are 100% expected in early access so avoid this game if you aren't willing to try to squash them.  How is the Story?  - Personally I find it much more engaging this time around. As a Sourceror there is a lot more room to be the bad guy if you would prefer it. In the first one it didn't make much sense to be an Evil Source hunter. I don't want to spoil anything at all but there were a lot of moments, even in side quests, that I thought were really cool. Some kinda sad stuff too with the Pet Pal Talent (Which lets you talk to animals).  Overall, I found it to be very worthwhile. I am excited to see new content added and bugs fixed as time goes by. So far, Larian is really knocking it out of the park.   TL;DR: I really enjoyed it. It is not yet complete. IF you're a fan of isometric or old-school RPGs this game is for you. Co-Op is fun. Skill system is neato. If you want a super complete experience this is not the game for you. Hope this helped someone!"

Dimmie,192,4,0,"September 5, 2017",Recommended,136.2,"28.8 Hours on Record, and that's how long it took me to complete the full Fort Joy & Swamp areas.  I know the early access is missing a lot, which only makes me want this game more, and more with every passing minute- especially after watching the developer video speaking about the playable undead (Undead being my favorite race in most any game I've played).  28.8 Hours on Record, and there are STILL things I haven't fully figured out, still quests I feel like I left incomplete. Still things I think I might be able to do, yet I couldn't figure out the answer.  For the early access content (Which I assume is not even close to what they've gotten completed right now), I was more then satisfied. I was seeking a create your own character game with an in-depth story, with some lovable and quirky companions, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 has scratched that itch.  I cannot wait for the full release and will likely try other actions and combonations on the side. And the fact that I can just get Lohse & Ifen as my companions and I'm not shoehorned into accepting anyone else pleases me beyond belief- It allows for some fun immersive experiences.  I want this game to be out so very badly, like the full release. I yearn for it and I'm giddy with anticipation- Couldn't recommend it more, especially for someone who has been craving a create your own character and a LOT of story driven content.  --------  I've decided to put a bit of an edit into my review.  Mostly to make a comparison of the Alpha version of Divinity Original Sin 2 and the Enhanced version of Divinity Original Sin- albeit I've only gotten 14 hours down on the first game.  First off the Character Creator:  (Divinity Original Sin, Enhanced Edition/The First Game) The main difference for me in regards to the character creator is the characters pasts. I'm someone who likes to feel immersed as the 'average jane' sort of character. A nobody, so needless to say in the original Divinity Original Sin game, I wasn't exactly fond of the backstories the customizable characters were given. The Source Hunters were established ""Bad Asses"" so to speak, no matter what class you picked there was a backstory explaining exactly how skilled they were.  There was no build up to your characters esteemed position. You were a Source Hunter, you're both well respected and somewhat hated/envied. You could be this rogue who was caught doing a job, a knight who was the last survivor of some kind of knightly house, a Witch that actually faced off against the Source Hunters until the 'Leader' asked for your assistance. Although each little back story was beautifully tailored, it left me with a feeling of: ""These characters are woven, personalities set.""  Which in turn, made me feel like if I replayed the game.. Although there are differing dialogue choices, decisions, and options.. The past of the Customized PC's makes it feel as if I'm just replaying the same people. (Mind you this is from my perspective)  (Divinity Original Sin 2, The Alpha Release) The Alpha Release is not the final product, so this portion of the review may change. However, from the most recent streams Larian's shown the public, it seems that the customized character is far more 'Pastless'. For people like me this is a fun immersive/roleplay aspect. I can, as an example, play a character who semi-leans towards the Magister's methods and refuses to use Source, and believes that locking away Source is the best course ofa ction. Although I doubt it's possible to keep the collar on the entire game (Something I will try to do on full release), it is still something I can mold as a 'past'.   I could throw them a background as a Soldier and a Scholar, I could go with the idea that they lost a loved one to the voidwaken when my character had first used their source abilities and that is why they refuse to use Source any longer. Not only that but each dialogue option doesn't make my character out to be a bonafied badass. As a simple example, if I choose the Soldier background and meet a certain NPC with a soldier background, there is an option to salute them- the salute feels like it implies that my character was beneath the other characters Rank. Whereas they once commanded, my character was merely a grunt.  There is a lot more growth from an immersive self-RP perspective, a lot more variety I feel. Though once again this is a personal opinion!  Companions:  (Divinity Original Sin, Enhanced Edition/The First Game) I've only met three companions in the first game, the man in the library, the locked up wild woman, the veteran source hunter, and the thief. Now I haven't really dealt with the library man but the Source Hunter & Thief are the ones I run with constantly. They do have the occassional smidgen of dialogue (perhaps this branches out later in the game, this is just me talking from a 14 hour period, which is half of what I played in Divinity Original Sin 2 to complete the alpha areas). However I don't feel.. Very connected to them, NPCs refuse to talk to them and would prefer ""Talking to the leader."" sure they may be fleshed out but as I see them they're.. Just nice things that punch stuff. With the occassional quip here and there. I'll likely play more Divinity Original Sin enhanced edition and change this opinion but for now I'm not too interested in the companions.  (Divinity Original Sin 2, The Alpha Release) The amount of love and care that went into these companions astounds me. They feel alive, and that's in the ALPHA of all things. Each is distinct, if someone offhandedly mentioned ""That one character that talks about boats."" I'd know it was Beast, and he isn't even a companion in the alpha!   Another example is Ifen, he is labeled with a tag called ""Villain"" in the alpha, I'm not sure if that will be there on release, but there are dialogue choices he can sue with that tag. It's implied that he's a horrible individual, but if you look at his personality, he is much more the  just a ""Villain"". He stood up for an elf when humans were rabbling her, he does not approve of killing an animal in an area that can be killed because it is disgusting. He's only a villain, because the world has ousted him as one- he's a mercenary, he's infamous, he's feared. But he's also someone who loves animals, someone that doesn't really enjoy bullying others that are 'lower on the food chain', he isn't a fan of senseless killing but kills only because it's his ""Job"". For an alpha, there was so much insane depth to him.  I didn't use Sibble or Prince much, but every interraction with them that I had, made them out to be people. Not a piece of the scenary or a meat wall that was needed to throw in front of swords.  ----  I'm sure there are things the original does better then the second- albeit I've yet to find that out. Some may say the combat, but the combat in #2 feels much more strategetic. I can't just strong arm my way through the combat like I do in 1, quite frequently at that. Perhaps I am just naturally biased, but, I think that #2 beats #1 in all categories. I enjoy both the alpha of dinivty original sin 2, and the enhanced edition of the original Divinity Original Sin.

Add in controller solid controller support as well as split screen Co-op (up to 2 people for one PC) and 4 player online Co-op AND competitive questing (yes there are multiple, conflicting paths to take in completeing a quest and two or more players can take directly opposing routes in those quests therefore competeing against each other) I do not see how you can not at least respect this game and its developers.

Several characters each with their own stories, custom characters with their own story. I have 60ish hours and still find new things each time I play through it. So many different interactions with various elements. New spells, magic schools, and more. If you like cRPGS, or the last game  and don't wanna wait, then I'd buy this game for sure.

TheDuke,313,4,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,96.8,"I know larian for a long time now, maybe because their headquarters are in my hometown, maybe because they just make awesome games. Or both. So when they announced they would start a kickstarter campaign for this game (the sequel to divinity orginal sin, suprise I guess when there is the number 2 involved in a title, I immediately signed up for it. I saw the game grow from within the kickstartes, I saw Swens comments on the changes, it all looked and felt so good. For backers they had some polls on what we wanted them to focus on. And, by Jove, did they pull our requests off. This game is awesome, storywise, gameplaywise, sound&musicwise,... (image a ton of more wises ;-) )If you are into RPG's, play this game! Take your time to explore it all, take your time for several replays of the game because the world is so open yo have so many opportunities you do not get all quests, storylines, characterdevelopments in one playthrough! Invest in this game and let the times pass, it will be next year before you know it. Before I forget it, this game can even be played in co-op (up to 4 players), what else do you need (maybe some beer, chips and a girlfriend, but that's not important now) For d&d fans they even implemented a game master mode (with one d&d campaign already worked out for your party!) to make sure you will never ever have to play the same story. Find yourself a good dungeom master and prepare to have some amazing adventures. Must buy! 13/10 for the Bronts among you."

Playing the premade characters is a must on your first play through, their backgrounds and personal quests give a lot of insight into world of Rivellon. And unlike the first game the difficulty scaled well with level and gear, many boss fights were difficult even at the end of the game.  All in all this may be the best PC game I have ever played. "

calibrojosh10,392,4,0,January 27,Recommended,100.9,"What I liked:   Improves almost every aspect from the first game     The best combat system thus far     Voice acting (I didn‚Äôt play the updated original)     Story at some parts is amazing     Game designed with co-op and solo in a CRPG???!!?! What You Need to Know:   I played this game solo (#FOREVERALONE), even though having two copies from Kickstarting the game. I would love to play the game co-op to see the game how a great game is even better with a friend competing for how the game plays.      With that out of the way, I want to start with the story. It‚Äôs all over the place. I don‚Äôt remember the story from the first one and I‚Äôll probably forget most of this game too. The first 2 acts which is about 60 hours of the game and feels at times lackluster in terms of the pacing, with only the ending of each act being amazing mostly in terms of what it makes you fight. The last 3 acts each get more focused on the main quest and side quests that branch from it. The huge time sink in the game is how many side quests you get or prevent from completing if you kill everyone.      The game does favor heavily playing the good side as after watching the ending you get 30 seconds if choosing anything other than the good option with no details on anything other than world is screwed. You choose to be good; you get over 10 minutes of details about every character you helped, companions, and the entire world in way more detail. I usually play the hero and help anyone I can and accidently picked the wrong option as it I thought it was the good choice. The whole tone at the end, is based on this final pick regardless of what you do in the rest of the game. So no matter how you play pick the good ending so you can hear your story.  The players you create can be just random dude that is standard with most RPG‚Äôs. I decided to play as the undead guy because I got the collector‚Äôs edition and he‚Äôs the statue you get, so why not. I‚Äôve never played as an undead which heals from poison, hurt from normal healing, as well as agro npc if you get naked, lol. With these premade characters of 6, they allow you get a quest for yourself and for each companion you bring along. You can also play as undead of any race too. So you get options bro.      The combat improves from the first one with two armors that while up prevents the major status effects that previously was percentage and more chanced based. I like this move to prevent save scumming for effects. You have battles taking place in areas that have verticality that can extend or block skills as well as increase or decrease damage based on the height. You have everything from the first one that I love with over one hundred skills that each have a purpose since you have elements playing a role. You get curse and blessed variants on each element. What I‚Äôm trying to say is the combat is by far my favorite so far. I‚Äôm loving turned based combat more and more with each game I play.      The game scales loot you find in the world but not quests as they are static, this saddens completing quests that are levels below you as the reward sucks. The AI you fight feels at times cheating as they never attacked my undead character with poison ever and always knew what elements are my weakness and feel like they know everything regardless of level or enemy type. This does make the game more difficult but actually plays like a real person would. I never got the feeling of laughing once at a stupid enemy messing up and healing my dude. Also when my characters are charmed they always do the dumbest stuff and use all my potions and scrolls, this was actually funny to watch and always had more than they could use. I do know the AI being too smart can be modded to feel more artificial if you don‚Äôt like that feature.       My biggest gripe is the interface to shift items around characters and when crafting no search option. This is so freaking stupid, with efforts put into teleporting items to relevant characters when needed for actions to save tedious shifting items; they forgot that when you pick up everything, I have a lot of crap sort to which player to give to. This is tedious when doing by item. Let us set items to go to certain players that use those items like arrows, grenades, and armor. So much time is wasted sorting and finding out who needs what item. Also crafting when you have hundreds of materials is hard to find the one you need. Dear god this was annoying at times. Not enough to‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•me off, but enough to annoy me.      Crafting is no longer a skill to put points into; you learn recipes and anyone can craft them. This sounds nice but I never really crafted until the end to prepare for the last fight. So that feature felt lackluster compared to the first game.       Overall the game is another instant classic just like the original. You don‚Äôt have to play the first one to understand this one. The combat has so much depth in it and was the main draw for me and did not disappoint. The story overall only felt epic at ends of each act with some fun side quests, especially the animal ones. I love the pet pal talent. All the major side quests had satisfying endings and I can‚Äôt wait for a 3rd game. These devs have made me to understand why old school RPG‚Äôs are the best and can‚Äôt go back to shallow ones anymore. Thanks Larian Studios for showing me da wae of CRPG‚Äôs as I‚Äôm still new to the genre, as to why I don‚Äôt have much recommendations.    My Score: A+ Paid: $135 Completed in: 90 hours  Games similar I recommend:   Magicka  ( pure magic combat)     UnderRail ( has some flaws)    Pillars of Eternity 2  (Haven‚Äôt played either game yet. Looking forward to them) "

The combat seems more enjoyable, especially if you make a super tank class.  In DOS1 being a straight tank would require you to use your whole first turn just to walk over to the enemy since you were so weighed down with armor.  With there being fewer action points, it almost seems like you can do more.  Some things in game are still locked off, like the ability to change starting skills, but its still fun.    If you are unsure whether to get this game or not, since you have not played the first game, BUY THE FIRST GAME and try that out since it is only $20 now.

Heredom,30,7,0,September 15,Recommended,721.9,"I blind-bought DOS2 for the only reason of his private multiplay lan/network options (real great thanks to devs for this) with campaing creating and mastering mode to custom-play with friends. I must admit I was disapointed after few playing hours to realize RPG content isnt as deeply as classic aD&D games and Builder very different of what I hoped with a just succession of very small maps.   If you got in your group someone who speaks with animals, have good persuasion and wits scores, with only DamageDealers you're sure you'll miss nothing and progress easely : quests are interesting but dont need any analysis or long searchs, no mortal traps anywhere, no oneshots (maybe with Alice or missing in making Hannag one of your friends), no wipes (except being too optimistic with Adrahmalihk), quite nothing to detect, quite nothing to miss anywhere (Braccus legs ?) and finaly a hardest difficulty mode ""too soft"" for most of players.  So... how explain our actual 600hours on DOS2 HM with many diff√©rent groups and choices (magical, physical, distants, ranges, with  tank, with only DD, 2 lonewolves, wipe maps in genocides, or pacifist ""just alone"") ? For me the biggest quality of this game isnt RPG at all but by-turn-combat options and strategies, with many different builds choices and mix for each member. Every tactical/HM combat is a +/- complex arena where you must analyze options and ways to success. Concerning GameMastering Leaks are finaly forces : this part of game must be seen as a way to play exactly the way you RPG-play around a table, and not to create a big scripted world like with Aurora (NeverwinterNights).

SOPMOD Musket,463,4,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,195.5,"Pretty good so far.  Its only in early access but I am impressed from what I see so far.  The combat seems more enjoyable, especially if you make a super tank class.  In DOS1 being a straight tank would require you to use your whole first turn just to walk over to the enemy since you were so weighed down with armor.  With there being fewer action points, it almost seems like you can do more.  Some things in game are still locked off, like the ability to change starting skills, but its still fun.    If you are unsure whether to get this game or not, since you have not played the first game, BUY THE FIRST GAME and try that out since it is only $20 now.  If you dont enjoy how that games mechanics are, you probablt will not enjoy this one."

This game is a throwback to the glory days of crpgs like Baldurs Gate, Fallout and many more. Decisions matter, your party matters, everything you do matters. Not only that, but it also offers a rich world, where things happen around you wether you intervene or not. To top it off, the game looks great and has the best soundtrack and sound design I have ever heard.  On the other hand you have some minor continuity issues that can prop up if you take the open invitation of the game to play your own way to the extreme and some clunkyness with the UI. Nothing too major, those are things I can tolerate in a game that comes along fully voiced.  Comparing this title to other so called RPG's of modern times bar the Witcher series reveals a lot about the state of the industry. Larian gives the big names like Bethesda or Bioware a run for their money with this masterpiece.  In closing: My characters girlfriend, a demon-posessed bard that turned into a demon hunter once I helped her purge the demon from her soul played a heartfelt song (Yes, they recorded it) in front of the throne of the last living god.

Mr. ZAion,111,5,0,"July 10, 2017",Recommended,219.6,"il gioco √® altamente consigliabile, anche se ha vari punti che lo rendono meno appetibile del suo predecessore.  Una volta abbandonato fort joy col tuo party, quel party ti rimane. gli altri personaggi non scelti vengono eliminati o comunque non sono recrutabili. Male a mio avviso, nel capitolo precedente potevo completare le storie di tutti i personaggi , qui no. Questo limita anche il volere creare un personaggio del tutto nuovo nuovo. se i personaggi principali della storia sono 6, e il party contiene al max 4 pg, se creo un personaggio ex novo non potr√≤ vedere la storia di ben 3 personaggi principali. vale la pena quindi usare i personaggi ""prefabbricati"". grave mancanza a mio parere, se lo fanno per farmelo giocare pi√π volte , per me non ha comunque senso.  La trama PRINCIPALE non √® all altezza del gioco. √® piuttosto banale anzi, anche questa mancanza grave, che sposta gli equilibri da ""capolavoro"" a ""ottimo gioco"". poca roba direte voi, ottimo √® ottimo. NO, perch√® capolavoro √® capolavoro.  L'inglese utilzzato con alcuni termini ""arcaici"" e la mole mastodontica di dialoghi con cui ci si scontra rendono il gioco faticoso anche per chi conosce l'inglese, si rischia di perdere parte della storia , se gioco per 3/4 ore e devo mettermi a leggere e tradurre tutto quello che c'√® scritto, di quelle 3/4 ore ne perdo almeno una, una e mezza. Ovvio che alla lunga viene da saltare alcuni di questi dialoghi, e rischi di trovarti a non capire il proseguimento della trama.  Il gioco √® comunque molto consigliabile, ma  gli autori si sono un po fatti prendere la mano, hanno aggiunto tanta carne al fuoco, troppa, per me, rendendo il gioco faticoso da finire, un po come se tu fossi a una grigliata di carne buonissima, ma ce n'√® talmente tanta che ti costringi a finirla, non per fame ma perch√® non vuoi sprecarne, ma alla fine ti senti un p√≤ stomacato e forzato."

SopiChan,87,2,0,"October 6, 2017",Recommended,108.8,"I have nothing but respect for Larian studios, they are truly an amazing game developer. I poured countless hours into the first D:OS and fell in love with the game. I was truly blown away by that game. When D:OS 2 became available as early access I immediately bought it to support Larian even though I waited til full release to play it. So far I've put 45 hours into the D:OS 2 and I'm playing on tactitian mode and I'm far from beating it but from everything I've seen so far this game further enhances and polishes the experience from the first game. I have zero complaints, this game is basically perfection. I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in the genre. It's a mechanicaly deep rpg with a great cast of characters, lore and combat. The game doesn't hold your hand and the story and quests unfold naturally. This isn't a game to rush through, you'll find the most joy out of it if you take your time and explore the world it has to offer.

I highly suggest you play coop because the dimension it adds to the game is so much fun as you and friend(s) just run into all the quirks and silliness. Every fight can be one if you just switch it up and try out new tactics.. or just get lucky! The amount of details and love put into this game makes AAA companies look like indie developers.  The game is not without its flaws, the crafting is shallower than it can be, some armors/weapons never would have a use in someone who wants to win, misclicking on things in battle can really mess up a long fight and turn the tide negatively and the rest is mainly just nit-picky stuff.   Overall this game is a solid product, it looks nice, it plays nice and its completely mastered the art of an rpg in a sandboxm, meaning you have rules and tools, but you can often abuse or mess around and accomplish things in interesting ways. This game is worth the cover charge and should be a no-brainer if you are on the fence and it is on sale!"
Sir Bartholomew,168,2,0,"October 2, 2017",Recommended,63.8,"What can I say that hasn't been said over 8,000 times? This game gives you complete control over what your character does and says. And I don't mean in the sense of ""Oh, I can walk over here and I have dialogue options."" I mean that if you don't like one of those Main Quest essential NPCs, you can attack and kill them. Few games take this risk, but Divinity: Original Sin 2 does and does it beautifully. It gives you options upon options on ways to accomplish your goals and completing quests. I have 25 hours in the game, all of them spent inside Fort Joy, re-loading, restarting and trying to make sure I didn't screw quests up. One quest has you find a dog's lost mate (if you have Pet Pal that is) and you eventually find her in the dungeons. Little did I know, if you escape the fort and then come back, every Magister and Source Hound will attack you on site. So I loaded back to make sure I could talk to the dog and complete the quest without killing his ex-mate.The game feels like a true virtualization of a DnD campaign. Where you choose your actions, the narrator narrates what happens and the world and people react. I've never played a game like this because I was always turned off to turn based combat in video games. But this game does it beautifully, incorporating strategy into the placement of every character and making the environment interactable with different elements and being able to use the landscape your advantage. The enemies can also do this, and will do it more as you turn up the difficulty. I had an enemy cast rain and, before my next turn, one of her cronies shocked my entire party. The rain and standing water caused by it allowing the spell to travel through the party. It's unbelievable what they were able to achieve with this game and I honestly can't wait to see what happens next"
ninjannuity,253,2,0,"September 25, 2017",Recommended,97.1,"Did you ever love playing a tabletop RPG (DnD, DCC, MCC, etc) but the logistics of getting one together was hard? Look no further adventurer, for Divinity: Original Sin 2 creates a tabletop experience right from your 'battlestation'.   Naturally, the game is challenging and open, there are many options of how to play and what to do in any given scenario. Kill everybody! What the hell right, they're in  your  way after all right? Or, befriend as many people (monsters, creatures, and animals as well) as is possible! What the hell right, they're part of  your  adventure after all right? Dialogue is so well done in this game, so profoundly voice acted that most characters have a unique feel and attitude as well as conversation choices (often per Origin character, meaning the five Origin characters have unique interactions with the world).  Character creation is fluid, meaning, at a certain point in the game you have an opportunity to re-spec each character in your campaign into a better presentation of what you wanted in the game. For example, didn't like the summoner healer and instead wanted a summoner ranger? Well, why not! Or perhaps a jack of all trades? That is probably one of the more enriching experiences of the game, feeling as though one did not ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up in terms of how they allotted skill points.  One of my favorite elements is the use of surface elements (blood & water, or either electrified, ice, fire, poison, oil, and cursed ground -- you'll see that for the first time and it is an intense experience especially on harder difficulties).  But beyond that, the playing with friends experience is open and ongoing. Say a friend can only hop in for a few hours on the weekend, while you've played 34 hours in 3 days? Well, they can jump into one of the characters you have, re-spec them to their liking, finish a couple quests and get out all while continuing along your level base and campaign. (and you can do the same to their campaign, should they ever make one)  PROS: - Great character development and voice acting - Awesome fluidity in how to build characters - Satisfying and intense turn-based combat (on Tactician it is hard, but not impossible) - Rewarding unique playstyles without catering too much to cheese (without giving it away, the game will sometimes know if you cheese certain puzzles) - Ongoing joining/leaving process for party play with friends - Brings visualization to the tabletop experience (imo, but still) - An absolutely enormous amount of content - Challenging and fun (or frustrating and befuddling) puzzles! - Connecting the dots on quests can be sometimes misleading, meaning the player needs to actually put in the work to logically figure out what the questbook/discovered dialogue related to the quest means in order to complete it -- this is not always straightforward and direct.  CONS: - There actually are some bugs, believe it or not, and because of that remember (REMEMBER!) to save OFTEN - Somewhat slow-paced (not a personal con, as tabletops are slow-paced, but I have heard this be a turn off so I include it) - Some quests are easy to miss or hard to figure out due to the last point on PROS, (not a personal con, but it is something that may frustrate people who aren't used to having the game hold their hand through exploration/decision making related to important quests)   tl;dr: great open RPG with turn-based combat akin to tabletop gaming, think outside the box and be rewarded, discover more about the characters and races and be rewarded (or disgusted). Combat is wonderful, albeit tricky, and full of dazzling experiences. Great for picking up and leaving off with friends who have busy or demanding schedules.  If you're a fan of turn-based RPGs then give this one a go on sale, or if you're a die-hard tabletop RPG person pick it up when you can. If you have friends you can convince to play this with you, do that, probably one of the best buddy-gaming experiences I have had in a great while."
TheGWD,240,2,0,January 5,Recommended,61.9,"I've been against Turn Based RPG's for a long time, cause most of them seem to follow suit with the same fights over and over and lack any real challenge.  This however brings so much strategy to the table where you actually feel guilty when you lose, as if it is your fault, because mostly it is.  This is how games are supposed to be, challenge and reward, not grind grind grind reward.  Its interactive and makes me pine for KotoR clone in this style.  You can literally cast invisibility on a patch of ice, and the enemy will run across it and slip, thats how complex this is.  Prepare to make lots of mistakes and ingenius decisions."

akashvercetti,708,2,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,134.1,"I funded this on Kickstarter, albeit for someone else. I bought this on release, having played the previous installment.   Personally, as good as Witcher 3 (200+ hours) was, this one is probably the best RPG of the decade, maybe ever.  Pros:  The loot system  The levelling mechanism  Dialogue choices which actually matter  The motherf*cking soundtrack (I have it on in the background even at work!)  Awesome pricing for a game with content as big as a ""AAA"" RPG game.  Side quests which actually matter and reward you.  No ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t grinding/exp farming.  Character development as the story goes on.  No dumbass enemy AI. The combat will make u strategize.  Developers who actually give a damn about the players in 2017!  A compelling storyline.  Cons:  Extremelly rare glitches/lags. Nothing to speak of.   Overall: a solid 10/10."

Darkstar,78,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,190.8,"I'm not good at writing reviews, but I feel like I have to give this game one, given how much fun it was. I just finished on Tactician difficulty the first time after having put in around 120 hours of work and I just have to recommend it for anyone who is interested in RPGs and the likes. The amount of content put into this game is astonishing, which in itself is, in my opinion, pretty damn good.  You can select from a lot of different classes and races, which have their own unique strengths and playstyles. And here's basically where one could write a novel about team composition, what's strong and what has better synergy with one another. And so on. Larian did a good job adding this much depth to the already nice combat system of the predecessor.   About the story, I won't spoil anything, but suffice to say: It's amazing. Your companions are interesting. The places you travel to are as well. The NPCs you meet along your journey are fun to interact with and almost always useful, be it in terms of selling you equipment/spells or giving you information about things you might wanna know.  The mechanics of the game are pretty nice to play and experiment around with. The variety by which you can approach battles is quite high in number as long as you're creative. This in turn, again, depends on your group composition, so selecting your option wisely has to be a given, especially on the highest difficulties.  About difficulties, I did struggle quite a bit on Tactician difficulty, since it was the first time I was playing the game. It might seem a little crazy what kind of bonuses the enemies get in terms of armour and HP, but I found them beatable by indeed exploring every little place on the map there was, speaking to almost everybody to get that little extra bit of experience and equipment which might just be enough to beat the next tough battle. As such, it would probably be best to play the game on Classic beforehand, to get an idea of the mechanics and so on.  And that's pretty much it. I enjoyed it a lot and probably will, still, in the future when trying out different compositions and what not. About the Arena mode and Game Master mode, I don't know, since I haven't tried them yet.  tl;dr: If you're a fan of RPGs and got the money, buy this game. I'm sure you won't regret it. :D"

Character development is personal and you really feel the pain and suffering written into the narrative. Combat is challenging and fun. A late early game element of being able to respec at any time takes away the fear of getting it wrong. All text is voiced by first class voice actors. This is the closest i have come to pen and paper gaming in years (always a GM, never a player!)  I heartily recommend this game to anyone. This is the best RPG PC gaming has to offer.   10/10 will be playing again.  Played as Lohse, final level 21 and very satisfied by my end story. Buy this game.

The feels and sense of pride and accomplishment you get at the end is like no other. The campaign was arguably the best 70 hours of my life and I enjoyed every second of discovery, storytelling, and loading saves. It is so rich and detailed and I would recommend this as Game of the Year, as you are getting a campaign, single player or co-op and arena mode as well as the gamemaster mode, which is Dungeons and Dragons, for $45. Easily over 250 hours of gameplay, and it just keeps getting better. Every triple A developer should take note- this is what the industry needs. I haven't been so enticed and enchanted by a video game in many, many, many years. I can say, after much consideration and time spent thinking about this game, it is my favorite game of all-time.

You dont need to have played D:OS1 to enjoy this game. Players of D:OS1 will have some easter eggs. Lighthearted and dark at the same time.  Voiced narrator and characters (every RPG needs one, once you go voiced you cant go back to reading blocks of texts)  Con: Some bugs and performance issues. some sadness at the end (the kind that you get after finishing a really good book with no immediate sequels)  This is one of those games that by the time the credits roll, you want to give the devs a standing ovation.  P.S: if you want front row seats to the main story use Fane as your main character.  If you want an amazing/rich and personal story, pick Lohse. If you want a revenge/redemption tale, pick Ifan/Sebille/Beast If you want to experience a disgraced noble's rise to power pick The red prince.   "

Deshark22,143,2,0,April 25,Recommended,119.3,"I mean you can transform even the strongest enemy into a chicken!Do i have to say more?If you like D&D this is a game for you,especially for the pen&paper D&D fans.The freedom and the mechanics of this game is the closest thing to D&D.Do you like to have half of your party fighting monsters and the other half trying to steal every single trader in a town or have them fool around like getting drunk in a pub,you can do that!Do you want to make your tank character into the most dangerous necromancer that would make even the Lich King proud?you can do that.You can even distract a rich trader with one character by talking to them and the rest of the crew can steal everything from them,im talking about the heist of your life here.But be aware,if you are new to this game like me,you gonna reload many times in most of the battles.Cause even in normal mode the enemies would give you hard time if you just rush in,in every battle without thinking of a strategy.And also remember every quest can go smooth without even breaking a sweat if you thinking smart or you gonna have a hell of time trying to survive the battle.And as a player with 50+ hours some tips for new players 1.Dont forget to get the bedroll at the start of the game,there is a bedroll somewhere inside the ship take,it and use it after battles if you need replenish health it has inifinite uses.2 dont waste gold on resurrection scrolls,you gonna find plenty in Act 2 or you gonna have enough gold to buy more.And last but not least tip,if you wanna keep all your party members after act 1,make sure you have them chainlinked and fight together in the last part of Act 1.(i found out this in the hard way).Enjoy!"

Lazuli,158,2,0,"September 25, 2017",Recommended,141.2,Game of the Year 2017 hands down. Immersive and beautiful surroundings to match the most wonderful of stories. The voice acting is some of the best done and the conversation options are unique with each person or thing you come to meet. Combat is fluid and fun with reactive environments and many skills and character builds to choose from. The multiplayer experience is even more entertaining because of the environmental effects that can take place on a battlefield. Freeze your friends and enemies for that extra adrenaline rush. 10/10 would recommend to any RPG fan.

Imagine D&D with one of the best story-telling and smart dungeon masters, and that is the feel of this game. Combat is incredibly in depth and tactical, hard modes require grinding and ingenuity. Sound design, voice work, character designs, class systems are all next level. If you're looking for constant action this might not be the game for you, but if you want to be absorbed into a world, experience an incredibly rewarding feeling when finally beating a fight, and spend hours exploring and shooting off on side quests this is the game for you.

My only complaint is that the GM mode is not as good as it should be. I wish it had been setup as a campaign editor, allowing you to set dialogue, even if its text only.

Like crafting nails with boots to make shoes that are slip proof (ice), I had no idea it would even work like that but the novelty of figuring that one out was fantastic!  This game gives you the flexibility to kill anyone, and I mean anyone. You might pay for it if you aren't high enough level to attack them but you still have the chance to ink out a victory from dire straits.   The conversations are rich and your dialogue can actually have a meaningful impact on your game.   I would highly encourage to play coop with your friends, its a load of fun!

Avascar,117,2,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,209.2,"What's makes an RPG? This game exceeds almost all of my expecations, and wipes away all of my fears. Engrossing writing, lovable characters, engaging combat, challenging choices, great soundtrack, and CO-OP. It's hard for me to not love this game in every aspect. And surely, it's a game that's difficult to top. Do note I will mostly talk about the main campaign, because it's what I put the most hours into.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a video game designed to look into your very soul, and asks a very direct question, 'Who are you?'. You can make a custom character, or one of the six origin characters (with specific dialogue, unique quests, and a generally different experience), and take part in an adventure alone, with NPC companions (with their own personality and relationship with you), or actual players. It goes back to the roots of RPG's, and gives you ultimate freedom to do and be whoever you want to be. To be whatever or whoever you want. And your choices matter, for every kill and every choice changes the world in some way. The world is real. You're in an adventure.  From the voice acted merchants, to the bustling cities and towns, you'll manage to find every nook and cranny as this game is filled with secrets only meant for the die-hard explorers. Different dialogue choices, hidden quests, OP loot, completely different outcomes; the world reacts to how you behave and what you know. Whether you decide to become the traditionalist hero, to the megalomaniac villian. The choice is ultimately up to you, and the game respects that. No choice nor fight is as black and white as they seem, as everyone in the story is both good and bad in their own rights (probably with the exception of the source king). It's a game you can't really have a ""perfect run"" on, choices will grant many different and branching choices based on what you do.  It goes back to the roots of RPGs from the days of Dungeons & Dragons, takes the modernism of current RPGs, and dosed with the whimsical love from Larian into a game that twists you as a whole, showing your true colors. In Co-op, it tests your relationships with your friends, as you must know only one out of the four adventurers can be Divine. It's a game that's both cooperative and yet slightly competitive, and it adds great storytelling to the entire experience.  Not only does the game contain loads of different dialogue, secrets, choices, and outcomes, it has some of the most revolutionary turn-based combat I've seen. Environmental effects from fire, rain, poison, and water. You can spend hours strategizing with your friends setting up the battlefields, as almost every enemy have their own weaknesses and strengths you must overcome. Each fight is interesting to their core, making you adapt to each situation in geography, location, environment, skills, and enemy types.  I only recently completed this game, and I realize it's one of those few games I'll have really fond moments of. It's a game where as soon as you beat it, you'll immediately start another run. I wouldn't mind paying for expansions, because the level of quality that Larian provides is amazingly superb. I don't want to give many spoilers to the game, it is full of many surprises that you must experience yourself. It's unforgettable, I tell you!  Of course, this game isn't perfect. Bugs are rather prevalent, as you literally can't get some achievements. Aside from bugs, I do wish there was more character development between my companions. This isn't an issue when all of your characters are actual people. But when they're NPC companions they don't talk very often, only during specific and important story scenes. If you play solo, there will be times when you don't notice their presence because they never have any dialogue to say, which is a shame in my opinion. I won't dabble on it much, but Act 4 is a bit lame as there isn't as much depth to it compared to Act 1 and 2. This entry of the series also messes up the timeline of the games, which puzzles many previous players like me. And the final boss isn't as magnificant as I wanted it to be (no multiple boss phases!?!).  There's also the Arena mode, which is an online PvP game mode. It's pretty dead, and it seems to be the most rushed out of the 3 (Campaign, Arena, and Game Master). You can only select a few presets of characters (no character nor skill customization), and in my experience I had trouble finding a match to play. I wouldn't play this for the Arena mode because it's pretty awful. The idea is great, but the execution just isn't there.  I also haven't managed to play much of the Game Master mode. A game mode that's quite literally Dungeons and Dragons. There's a rather small following for it, and there are custom campaigns out you can play right now. And from the looks of it, seems very fun. The combat is very streamlined, and the numbers are very easy to manage. I find it better than the use of spreadsheets, very long text documents, or literally piles of papers in my experience. But ultimately, it's personal preference.  But aside from that, everything about this game is fantastic. OST (Main theme, Rivellon, all the character theme songs), aesthetics (perhaps the humans and dwarves are a bit ugly looking), storytelling, dialogue, choices, secrets, combat, mod support, and so much more. Don't think my critiques give you the impression that they ruin the entire experience, because they don't. In the end, you'll feel like you finished an adventure. You mold the game, and yet the game molds you. The world of Rivellon reacts to your moves, with its inner gears shifting and moving. You will tell countless stories of it, I assure you.  So, what makes an RPG? The storytelling experience. And a storytelling experience that allows you to be in the eyes of a child, becoming whoever or whatever you want and having your choices matter in a significant way is an astonishing feat all on its own.  And that, is why I would easily give this game a 10/10. Simply revolutionary."

Scooty,51,2,0,September 5,Recommended,56.6,"Not a title for 100%ers or the very tactical.  This is fun on it's own AND there is a Dungeon Master mode I havnt used yet. Downside is sort of strange fiction where clerics heal by sucking blood off the ground? Very detailed but still odd to me. Fun game.  I'm having an issue where I get jumped by badguys near the edge of town. I run into town and stand next to a town guard.  I stay in combat because exiting teleports you like fast travel. He is still out there watching me get beaten down in front of him while never ever attacking the guy burning EVERYTHING. (the fire does nothing to the guards and townsfolk not in combat yet hugging)  So there is that. Still a good game.  This is quickly turning into a feces title.  In sneak as a barrel tucked in a corner behind a tent BUT the guard detect vision goes through that type of object.   So much saving and loading because of lack of polish.  For instance just now; a fading mine that cloaks when your near.  -I saw it and manuver my man to a point where straight line in a safe corridor was the direct path. -I click the destination and my digidal dynamo heads off straight as an arrow like planned, only to vear 45* left straight into the mine blowing it and dodging a terrifying patch of THIN AIR!

This game is packed full of content, deep combat, infinite replayablility, and good old tender loving care by a studio that clearly cares about their game just as much as we, the players, do.

I've never played Original Sin 1, but it is truly a nice RPG game. It's a turn-based game, u'd better know that before buying it. But don't just say, ""I don't like turn-based games."" U'd better watch videos about this game, then u'll find it much different from that u imagined before. When out of fights, u'll control your team like in the game Dungeon Siege, only when fighting the enemy will u control your team in a turn-based way. Also, I really enjoyed the beautiful views a lot, u'll know what I mean when u truly play the game. This game is fantastic for me. Looking forward to play all chapters of it. But there are also some bad things to tell u. There r no marks on the map which show u where u can finish your mission. And u cant see the characters from about 2 screen's distence. That means u have to go to every corner and use your mouse to see NPCs' names. This will truly take players a lot of time unless they remember where the NPC is on receiving the mission. This game is very expensive, I know that, but it's worth buying for those who r interested in turn-based games. I really don't want to see red comments like"" why is this game turn-based? I spent fu*** over 40 dollars for this rubbish?"" That's your problem! Why don't u look at the introduction before buying it? I love this game, but also hope that after this beta, they'll add some more languages. we all hope to enjoy the game in a much easier way. Many Chinese players bought this game.

Darth Jar Jar,9,2,2,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,120.2,"I'm a big fan of looting. This game is the ultimate loot-game. I always loot everything.  I'm also a very impatient person. This leads to me often skipping conversations, and suddenly I'm declared a hero, and have 10 people attacking me. This could be catastrophic, but as I said, I always loot. Turns out drinking tea and spend half the match eating random items is a very good strategy.   My co-op partner in crime is not a looter, but actually reads the dialogue. Working together is thus a very good way of playing. He gets all the story + depth of the game while I get to spend more time around looting.   A tip tho: Distribute the loot, quite impractical when the team member with all the healing + scrolls manages to set herself on fire and die... 3 attempts in a row.   Just waiting for the loot from the kickstarter now.  The lizard design is absolutely gorgeous, and I spent quite some time choosing the best lizard style to match my true self, only to keep running around with a bucket or blanket over my head inside the game.  10/10  "

I'm enchanted. Despite the odd bug or insane difficulty spike between battles here and there, it's close to perfection. Highly recommended"
Nezumi,154,2,0,"September 21, 2016",Recommended,262.1,Probably gonna be the best game of the year.
Owning Duck,73,2,0,"November 2, 2017",Recommended,364.0,"This game is now my most favorite game, I played DOS twice, one playthrough by myself (150 hours) and one with my friend (60 hours). I can say that I really enjoyed the first game and was really looking forward to DOS 2. I'm almost 200 hours into it and I am not even done with the campaign. But being nearly done I think I can give a proper review.  Combat: So most people criticize the game for being turn-based rather than a real-time with pause function. But it feels right in place as the combat still feels so engaging. The combat is tougher since a lot of skills that you have, the enemies have as well. This makes the combat harder but also more rewarding once you get past it. The game is hard yet fair. There are fights that seem impossible but the game provides us with the tools to win or hides the tools within the world. A lot of the skills feel strong and useful. But towards the end game, I find that magic damage started to be more obsolete as it is much faster and easier to physical as that it the most reliable way to damage. Though that might be because my team consisted of 3 physical dealers and one wizard.  Story: This is by far my favorite part of the game. The story is rather simple yet done in a way that makes it compelling. And as someone who played the other Divinity games, there are a lot of surprising plot twists that I was surprised by. But where the game shines the most is the origin stories. You can either create your own character or choose one of 6 pre-made origin characters that have their own backgrounds. And and these stories are very well-written with equally well made characters. It is so interesting to see how much the game changes because of who you are. If you didn't pick an origin character, you can still recruit them but after a certain point, they will become unavaible. It is a rather intersting thing of being a side character to the origin character's stories though. And each origin chracter will have a personal quest which will result in some drastic endings. But some advice, do not play as Lohse. Not because she is bad, she is a great character with a one of my favorite stories. But Lohse is best when played as a companion and her personal ending yields the best reward a video game has ever given.  UI: I will be blunt about it, it's bad. Inventory management is a nightmare. Sadly it is also required in powering up your weapons in the end game. You will spend a long time in your inventory looking through it to find a single item. Crafting can be done through a seperate menu but most of the time you will be combing random stuff together and that is horrible. In the end game, you will have so much clutter mostly involving books and paper with no swift and reliable way to dispose of them.   Other Notes: The game has quite alot of bugs as well. The first area will be rather polished because it was in early access for a long time. But the game is large and some parts are even broken at times. But I would like to say that I have not faced a bug bad enough to take away from my enjoyment. The game is best played (in my opinion) with a roll with it attitude. Just accept mistakes that happen. It is really fun to see all my mistakes bite me in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•later down the line. And before I forget, the soundtrack. It is a masterpiece. DOS 2 has a different composer from the past Divinity games (RIP Kirill) but the new composer has truly put his heart and soul into it and it is an absolute joy to listen to.   Just buy the game. Larian deserves all of the praise and hopefully they will make a console version so we all can share in the masterpiece that is Divinity Original Sin."

Well in reality publishers do have their uses since they have deep fat pockets, but at least Larian is showing others that you don't need a business guy looking over you shoulder to make great games.  The RPG game type does not really fit all tastes I mind you, this game is best for a RPG lover or a few friends enjoying some relaxing fun time. Not really going to give you intense gun fights or stuff, it's not the right game type."

I_Rock_Fiction,23,2,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,214.9,"Student Game Designer : Focus in UI/UX (Overall) 10/10     This is Hands down the best Turn based RPG i have ever played. Numerous improvements have been made since the last game (Divinity Original Sin). The Textures and animations are amazing. Also There seems to be a much more deep combo system compared to the last game which will make for some fantastic experamentation. Combat is still very interesting with most encounters resulting in different choices by the Enemy AI which ""spices"" up engagments.   Pros   The Characters and Dialoge are of course very good, with all of the origin characters having interesting backgrounds. your choices are questioned by your party memebers and many of them have different veiws, as they should.  The Skills and combos are fantastic and really fun to use although you will need to remember that your combos can be exploited or even used agaisnt you by the enemy Ai.  Armor and weapons look great and there seems to be a wide variety of different skins for each type of weapon.  While i did not explore the crafting system as much as i should have its pretty much the same as the last game. Although there are supposed to be way more (items etc) that we can craft.  The sound affects and the soundtrack are just as catchy and cool as last time. (GIVE ME THE SOUNDTRACK)  Cons.   Some enemy types have almost unfair adavantages against a party of any compsition, namley the undead and or necromancers/witches. Undead/ dark magic users, can both heal from poison and blood, as well as regular healing spells, which really just makes the battle alot longer than it needs to be. Ive never been a fan of undead being able to use the Hydro Healing spells. They should benfit from blood/poison fields/ spells only.  The Ui Still needs a bit of improvement as the item management system is still not that great. But is ok. It is very simplistic/minimalistic which is fine but we will need access to a universal chest of some sort to store our materials and such in. Or multiple backpacks will need to be equipped to carry most of your loot /items. Rather than turning one character into a pack mule or having lots of items spread out around multiple characters.      "

Morr-gan,334,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,116.6,"The game's start is an extremely, extreeeemely steep learning curve.  you essentially start off with no armour, and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• weapons, and will be placed against enemies that could 1v1 you and win without breaking a sweat.   Even Dark Souls gives you an easier time starting off than this, trust me.  I recommend playing an Origin character before playing as custom, to get your first experience with a unique character, as the different characters have their own personal questlines and dialogue, which is interesting.  Combat is amazing as ever, however the initiative system has changed from the first one, instead whoever simply has the highest will start (or if it's a scripted boss/enemy to go first), then it will alternate between friend/foe/friend/foe.  Magic Armour and Physical Armour are interesting and basically grants you guranteed immuntie to certain status effects, like Stunned, Knocked down and bleeding unless said armour is reduced to 0. has it's drawback as it means if you dont have the perserverence attribute levelled some you'll get stunlocked in unfortunate positions by mages.  Lots of gametime for the story, with even double if you don't skip all the dialogue and pay attention to side quests (which I didn't).  overall 9/10 some bugs, but overall game is fantastic with a great story."

Score : 9/10   The story is very well written set in a fascinating world where CHOICES MATTER. The sidequests are very diverse unlike most games that are filled with fetch quests.   The turn-based combat is very engaging as it rewards you for controlling the battlefield and keeping everyone alive (very important). Patience is key here to prepare setups and counter some status effects (magic and physical).  The early game is VERY tough, much like Xcom 2 where your gears are underleveled so killing enemies at this point is frustatingly difficult even at Classic Mode. Also, once you're done with 1 major area, you'll have to move to a different region so you can't return back to finish any incompleted tasks. So take your time and LEVEL UP!"

And instead of going on a trip IRL I just binged almost 140 hours within 2 weeks on this gem of a game.  Best combat System I have seen in recent years. Great Story. Awesome characters. Modding Tools that are quite similar to what we have in Skyrim which has me expecting a similar long term success as Sykrim had. Gamemaster mode, which scratches my Pen & Paper itch, can't wait to try that with some friends.  And it only is 44,99.  Recommending this game is a no brainer.  Don't wait for a sale on this one. Larian deserve to be supported as they delivered a real masterpiece."

As far as RPG's go, it has it all, ""classes"" that give you a background feeling, wich you can then add to the background choice. Then as another thing they do well is that a class is not set in stone, so you can become what ever you want after the start or mid game etc.  The story is excellent, well written and immersive. I've yet to finnish the the game and still i am enthralled by it. As for the character you encounter, same there realy, well written and exciting characters with agendas that realy breathes life in to them.  The combat aspect is as expected, i played the first game and so far its basicly the same but enhanced if you ask me. A turn based combat system with Action points and enviromental controll that has to be taken in to account.  I rate 4.9/5 or for the less understanding of that scale i give it a 9/10. Will update this once im finnished with my first playthrough!  Post Scriptum: If you isn't in to turn based combat that i would describe as DnD digitalized i would not reckommend this game to you, even if the storytelling and interactions are great, you would not enjoy it. But if you are, PLAY IT!!!"

badesumofu,143,2,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,16.6,"If this is the sort of game you like, or you think you might be interested in this game: buy it. It's amazing. This is an old-school top down RPG like we played in the late 90s but rather than being a game that feels like it could have been released in 2000 and then teleported to 2017 (like Pillars of Eternity), it feels like what these games would be if the genre didn't just vanish but rather continued to evolve over the last 15 years.   The turn-based combat is fantastic. It actually feels tacitcal and when you figure out a clever way to approach a battle and then win, it is very satisfying. If you play for tactical combat, you'll love it. If you play RPGs for an engaging story and world, you'll love it. If you love tinkering with builds and different class comps, you'll love it. If you love reactivity, freedom, and choice and consequence - you will love it.  If you think you might possibly enjoy this game - buy it, you will not regret it.

They are continuing to update the game even now after full release to patch out some of the missed bugs which is reassuring.  Unlimited replayability, I've restarted at least 10-15 times now without finishing the game just because I figure something out, or I want to try something else.  Not because what I'm doing is getting stale, but rather that I'm just so curious about different outcomes that I'm compelled to go look at the alternative.   The multiplayer hop in/hop out style is super easy to learn, and I've already started working with the game master mode.  As a DnD GM, I can see the potential of divinity's game master mode, but I can tell it will take some learning and getting use to.

wally,143,2,0,January 17,Recommended,147.0,"This game is a veritable masterpiece, and I would wager the best game I have ever played. The sheer freedom you are offered and the extreme creative solutions you can use to figure out any and every puzzle, battle or even little distractions, is alone enough to make this purchase well worth it. But Larian Studios went above and beyond fully voice acting all 75k lines of dialogue. The game offers a unique take on combat, heavily focusing on the environment around you and how to use it to your advantage in combat, constantly fighting for highground, throwing barrels, or laying down sheets of slippery ice in order to barely claw through the fight. The combat offers insane depth and even offers an arena mode in which you can duel other players with custom parties. The story experience also offers a full drop in/drop out 4-player experience. Every player is free to do what they want and at times this can lead to conflicting goals and fighting between what the party will do.   Even with all of this to offer, Larian went even further and added a GM mode, which allows users to create custom campaigns and a game master to guide the groups adventure. This also comes with full steam workshop support, allowing you to mod the game as you wish.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is, I think, the best game ever created and I suggest that you purchase this work of art as soon as you are able."

The combat is tactical and exciting, so much can go wrong so fast, or everything can go right and its the best feeling ever. Also this is the first game where I've actually been able to kill a child. such a small thing that almost no other game has been able to accomplish.

Nethys/BlackViking,335,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,80.9,"The Co-op is pretty fantastic, with split screen and online gameplay available. 4-player Co-op is huge, especially when each character has their own backstories, motives, and alignments. Some quests mean you gotta talk to someone, someone else may want that person dead. Sometimes you even gotta fight your friends in a fun arena-style system. Combat is amazing, especially when you have the turn-based gameplay to help stage brutal combos to dispatch multiple enemies. From exploiting elements, to staging ambushes for the enemy you just turned into a chicken, the options are vast. Story so far is pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing good. As I stated initially, everyone has their own upbringings and goals that sometimes conflict or align at various parts of the plot. While the beginning of the game seems very linear (""We gotta get out of this place!"") The variety of methods and questlines to accomplish that is guaranteed to bring in a second playthrough. I recommend this game to people who enjoy co-op gameplay, intricate stories, or just solid fantasy RPGs; this game has been a hit on all fronts for me and it feels good to play a sequel that just comes out better than the previous game.

Divinity: Original Sin 2 is on a level of quality and brilliance that only very few game studios have achieved so far.

Allanon,58,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,305.7,"I spent 99% of the time dicking around exploring the map.  In many other games I wouldn't have had a great time doing that because the map would end or there wouldn't be anything particularly interesting to find.  In say, Skyrim, there would probably be a cave with generic enemies to kill and that would be all.  In this game though, there was always something utterly magical to find.  I helped a rat and a turtle living in a cellar find love.  I talked to and killed evil scarecrows and helped a succubus escape a twisted hellscape with her lover.  I broke into the cellar of a kindly old woman who offered me a loan after her cat told me there were suspicious types down there and found debt collectors who turned into demons when approached.  Yet the most magical thing of all is how natural and meaningful it felt.  As a I naturally progressed through the game's story, I ran into so many bits that rewarded this idle and almost obsessive exploration.  Indeed, the story is so wonderfully open ended at times giving such simple yet broad goals that the only correct thing you can do at times is explore and lose yourself in this magical world that Larian has made.    Despite the broad nature of most of your goals the story still manages to remain present and intelligent.  Oftentimes it will surprise you by popping up at the most unexpected moments with new twists and turns in the most natural of fashions leading up to a conclusion that is both epic and satisfying.  At the beginning, your goal is simple: escape Fort Joy.  The game gives you little to no guidance on how you might do that yet you'll never feel at a lost since you'll discover so many possible ways to escape just by naturally exploring your environment.    This is easily the best game I have ever played.  There is so much magic, so much attention to detail, and a utterly brilliant and punishing battle system to boot.  It will be a long, long time before a game ever comes close to how good this game is."

Combat is deep and cinematic, both punishing and rewarding. Your party has their own fascinating stories and personalities, and the world your playing in feels chaotic and on the brink of complete anarchy. Its shaping up to be an excellent game, Im already finding myself both wanting more, and eagerly awaiting the September 14th release.

Over the last year I have peaked in and out to see what Larian Studios added and/or removed. To my surprise, every time I took a peak the world, characters, game mechanics, and story were all better than the last time I played.   Now that we are at release, I can say with the utmost certainty that Larian Studios has done a masterful job. Though I am only in Fort Joy, the level of polish and player choice is unlike anything I have played in recent memory. This is a studio that deserves recognition as not only did they keep all of the promises they made during their kickstarter campaign, but they also added so much more (Voice Acting, All Undead Races, Controller Support).  Congratulations, Larian Studios. You were amongst my top developers before this, and based on what I have played, you may have caught up to CD Projekt Red. Well done!"
Doughychan,473,2,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,202.5,"It was an early access game that did not feel like an early access game at all. I kept trying to stop myself from playing so I could enjoy the game as a whole on its full release, but damn it was tough and I ended up putting 11 hours into it.   I will eventually update the review once the full game comes out. I just can't wait to spend hours on this, and I am also very excited for the Game Master mode.  Edit: The voice acting is god damn good. I can't imagine playing this without the VA now.   The combat is very interesting and very rewarding. You have to play smart and position yourself well. The fights are very difficult at the very beginning but as time goes on the game gets easier as you start to know how what you are doing. Utilising every members of the party and creating big combos never felt more satisfying.  The story so far is great. The pacing is good and the story itself is quite dark. Helps when you have interesting party members (who are also quite insane).   I haven't even gotten my hand on Game Master mode yet (my main reason for buying this game) or the Arena. There are just so much you can do in this game. If you are a fan of RPG game, this game is a must buy."
`discoBiscuit,111,2,0,"September 10, 2017",Recommended,202.7,"Just finished the Alpha Release - all the way up to the boat point, and you cannot progress any further and get kicked out to the menu. I am seriously considering getting the first Divinity, but with only a few days left to wait for the release of 2 (I hope) I may just wait it out.   Really great mechanics, the dialogue is my favorite. Characters have dimension in this game, even ones that are first-time interaction. I'm sure there will be lapses in some of the characters in the full release, but I am hopeful. Combat is really fantastic, the amount of spells available is quite a lot, and apparently at release we'll have more. It can be an alchemical process, like you could light yourself on fire, then bless that fire and it will apply health regeneration. Things like that.   The only thing I didn't like, since I didn't start with a few pals that already have the game, I cannot play on their multiplayer save, and they can only play on my singleplayer save, as in, the only can choose my character. Although, I could give them control of one or two, three characters.   --Will update upon release--"

Score : 9/10   The story is very well written set in a fascinating world where CHOICES MATTER. The sidequests are very diverse unlike most games that are filled with fetch quests.   The turn-based combat is very engaging as it rewards you for controlling the battlefield and keeping everyone alive (very important). Patience is key here to prepare setups and counter some status effects (magic and physical).  The early game is VERY tough, much like Xcom 2 where your gears are underleveled so killing enemies at this point is frustatingly difficult even at Classic Mode. Also, once you're done with 1 major area, you'll have to move to a different region so you can't return back to finish any incompleted tasks. So take your time and LEVEL UP!"

Pros: + Amazing gameplay; well improved over Original Sin 1 with quite a few extra mechanics + Delicious graphics; well suited for the genre  + Story is improved compared to the previous game + Interesting characters; especially your companions (rolled with Fane, Sebille and The Red Prince) + Content-heavy; can find quests and interesting things in every corner of the map + Great co-op (up to 4 players); loads of fun when playing with friends, works very well + Good price/hours ratio, especially if you include replayability and multiplayer  Cons: - Very weird difficulty curve; had a tougher time with battles in Act 2 than the final boss. - Some battles are totally not fun; [VERY MILD SPOILERS] who ever designed the Scarecrow battle should be whipped in the public square - Game is sometimes very cheesy; prepare to cheese it from time to time in order to compensate - Some side-quests seem to be cut short; development seemed rushed in some areas - Minor bugs and balance issues (some have been patched at the time of writing the review)  Overall, a solid sequel to the original Original Sin (heh).

You are somewhat free how you overcome certain challenges (sneaking, plain combat, hidden entry, talking, persuasion.........) +Consequences of your choices +FULL VOICE ACTING. Everything is voice acted, from the narrator to every little npc you see. It gives a great sense of immersion.   -very difficult for new players to the genre, no handholding (which is a good thing imo) -the inventory is a clusterf**k. If you arent somewhat patient, you will hate it -quirky dialogue sometimes, this can be seen as positive or negative, Id appreciate a more serious tone, though, it keeps a good balance -colors too bright imo  Thats just the things on top of my head. For every rpg fan, especially oldschool pnp or crpgs fans or just people with a little bit of patience, you re in for a GREAT time. Getting back the feeling of playing nonstop without getting bored.

jenn_geoffroy,182,2,0,October 2,Recommended,245.1,"I play RPGs for the story. I play strategy games for the tactical puzzles. In RPGs, the combat is (at best) an okay distraction between story points, and if there's a role-playing way to avoid a fight, I'll usually take it. In strategy games, the story is a thin trope-ridden veneer I mostly ignore.  Then along comes the DOS games. The only RPGs with a story I really really WANT to finish, alongside fights I will make a detour to take on. I'll still avoid fights with persuasion and roleplaying when I can, because I like the immersion and playing a clever character, but in DOS2, I'll loop back after obtaining my objective, plant as many barrels of oil and ooze I can find next to the enemy I conned into letting me run around, and then light them up like a roman candle before taking them down.  There's some good funny moments. Some gory creepy moments. Some really really hard moments (yikes, the crucial reveal in Lohse's story GUTTED me - it even gutted the hard-case who was guiding me on that quest, that's saying something as to how heartwrenching a choice needs to be made). And there's moments when you finally kill someone who's been irritating you for awhile by turning him into a chicken before giving him a final whack and shouting IN YOUR FACE as he explodes or something. Ahhh, good times, good times....  (Edited to remove potential light spoiler from Lohse's quest, never know...)"

Baulders Gate, Diablo, D&D, etc.) then this will be your salvation from the lack of major titles in the genre. It stays true to its table top roots while also giving a stylish spin to everything we've had to use our imagination for over the years. The combat is fast paced and tactical. Everything is a weapon, including the environment. It really comes down to what you have available to you and what you can think up with each situation. The story is well written and engaging. It keeps you hooked to see how your particular play through pans out in the grand scheme of the world. Plus the mulitplayer support adds a lot of fun and interesting ideas to the mix. Such as your companions (either real people or a.i.) will each view the quests differently and have different motives and reasoning for every action. Sometimes things work out, other times you end in a bloody brawl after a quest choice turns sour. Each adventure breathes a wealth of choices and possibilities. Don't forget the game master mode either! Being able to create your own adventures for your friends, or anyone for that matter, to battle through is worth the price in itself. There will always be new content to play or create to keep this game going for ages. PVP is also included to add that pinch of competition outside of your main campaign that turns into a explosive game of wits before you know it. All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone seeking adventure or a little more ""choice"" out of their game. Have fun solo or with friends as you fight to replace the divine that the world has lost. May your blades and mind be sharp!"
ItsThePappy,69,2,0,"March 25, 2017",Recommended,5.6,"Even for a game that is in ""Alpha"" for the time being, it is several times more polished and enjoyable then some other games out currently.  The difficulty of battle and the thought that goes into strategy of it all is incredible, although i am biased since i am a huge fan of turn based fights. Can be a bit infuriating at first since most fights you'll get into at first will pretty much destroy you until you get a handle on how it all works.  All in all its a lot to take in at first and that can be discouraging, but pushing through and spending time playing the game and before you know it you'll be enjoying this game more then you thought you would."

It even beats the fantastic Dragon Age.  Very nice voice acting, challenging and tactical battles, nice graphics - the full package.  I agree with some reviews, that the combat is not easy, but honestly this is exactly what makes it fun... the combination of different elements, height differences, physics and the fact that even the simplest enemies have special skills etc. make each combat interesting.  No more grinding through simple skeletons with the same tactics each time! Heroes will die and you will have a hard time to ressurect them.

A disembodied lizard leg appears and my prince is given two options, ""Pick up"" and ""Eat."" Naturally I choose ""Eat."" A spirit appears and says ""You Savage! I hope you choke on me!"" giving my lizard prince a curse. I couldn't stop laughing...  There is a lot of humor in this game that is on purpose and a ton that is seemingly accidental. The writing is great and the stories are enthralling. I find myself wanting to complete side quests to find out what happens rather than simply squeezing that last bit of XP. Half the time I walk around after a quest is already completed just to see if there are any additional clues as to why somebody did something.  So far I am really enjoying this game.  =============== Downsides: - There are a lot of bugs. I have found a lot of situations where I have to reload the game. For example; a battle where I can't loot a corpse (the arachnid in the graveyard).  - More bugs. I discovered that the reason I couldn't target enemies in the Driftwood arena was because I wan't zoomed in enough. After I realized this I was able to beat the competition.  - Even more bugs (getting access to a waypoint early because I was on a cliff overlooking it, which allowed me to fast-travel to the waypoint and expedite my storyline). In the end it wasn't a big deal but my quest progress leap-frogged past the initial quest giver ( I met the quest giver long after I defeated the boss)."

Co-op works flawlessly and it is great to jump in and out of your friend's games.  The main campaign has plenty of content and this is one of those rare games where I feel it is worth the full price tag.    If you are on the fence about this game, I'd say 100% purchase it.

Dais Spires,41,2,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,51.8,"I love this game. I played the first one for a long time so I was already a fan, but this one is better then the first by far. I love the new class skills, the new races, and simplified crafting system. The game is appropriately difficult, and you will most likely have to do some battles more then once to figure it out. So save often. Build craft is so much fun in the game, and the replay value is very clear from the start. I keep wanting to make new characters just to try things differently. I love Love LOVE playing a Rouge. Teleporting, sneaking, stealing and back-stabbing. It's just the best.   The multiplayer in this game is a lot of fun too. I play with my husband for hours on our days off. We yell at eachother from other rooms to try and figure out a strategy, or when one of use screws up and kills the other. I feel like you wanna play this with someone you really like though, because the first time they accidentally stun you, and ruin your big attack you've been setting up, you'll wanna kill them. I am very glad this game is Co-op though. We need more games like this in the world.   So, get this game. You already want to, or else you wouldn't be here. Just do it. You won't regret it, and if you do, then there is something wrong with you. This game is amazing."

Chris,273,2,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,131.8,"Bang up ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing game. Seriously, best RPG in many, MANY years. I haven't ever really reviewed a game before, so I'm going to give it my best shot. This game is about as close to DND on a digital medium that you can get while still being its own game. Fully interactive environment, (tons of fire, electricuting water, exploding oil and poison) and the developers really played with it.  Just a small spoiler alert, but to just put it in perspective how the environment comes into play. There's one fight pretty far into the game on top of a mountain of wreckage. Out of absolutely nowhere, tons of oily blobs come to kill you. Every time you damage them, and they move, they spread oil. So the whole time, you're trying to batter them down as you move up the mountain to get away from them. The dev's then have it to where when the oily guys finally go down, TONS of fire guys show up and ignite all the oil. I know its kinda hard to get it across, but fighting ontop of this giant mound with fire everywhere trying to batter down the fiery slimes, seriously felt cool.   Character creation wise, I mean it's pretty good. Not a ton of customization, just standard face 1, 2, 3, etc. But honestly not a big deal. As you develop what your character is good at, you grow to love em.  Classes are pointless, you build your character the way YOU want to, so they can literally become anything. I've got a few characters going, and all feel super unique and diverse. A dwarven rogue shapeshifter who can grow a tentacle arm and smack people around as well as shed all enemies magical resistances to support, I've got a fire slinging geomancer who uses oil‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to explode just about everyone, and I've got a necromancer archer who summons tons of undead corpses to explode all over people. It all feels super unique and fun to play. There's times where I miss my other characters, hop on them to play, and then miss the one I was just playing. Kinda neat.  If you want my advice, 100+ hours advice, PLAY WITH FRIENDS. Preferrably in person. Hit up an old school lan party feel, bring cpu's over, build a SUPER diverse cast of characters, and hunker down. Pizza and beer obviously. Plan for an all nighter, because I literally PROMISE you you'll be playing til 6am EASY. I haven't personally had a game grab me like that in many years, and god damn its a good feeling to have back. Go larian, you guys are the men and women making games great again.  10/10."
Daxwred|Meliconi,352,2,0,February 7,Recommended,68.9,A beautiful game with a delightfully intracate combat system. I played this game with 3 other friends for the main campain and we keep coming back instead of playing some thing else.
Ghouleh,354,2,1,February 18,Recommended,318.0,"A beautiful cluster****.   Full disclosure - the only other game in the Divinity series I've ever played to completion is Dragon Commander, which couldn't be more different than this one.  I didn't enjoy Original Sin 1. I didn't get it. It was so strange to me - because it was a mechanics-focused RPG. Everything interacted with everything else, and the possibilities seemed endless. The story didn't grab me, and such things are important in a cRPG, and so I eventually abandoned it.  Initially, I was afraid I would feel the same about Original Sin 2. The first act isn't particularly strong, but thankfully, I endured for enough time for the story to sink its hooks into me. Ironically enough, it was only then that I realized all of Original Sin 2's virtues, which have little to nothing to do with its plot.   The Mechanics Original Sin 2, like its predecessor, is about the absolutely ludicrous shenanigans you can pull off both in and out of combat. Environmental hazards are everywhere, from water to blood to poison to ice to fire- and they interact in often explosive ways to different skills, items and spells. The game gives you access to the game-changing Teleport skill very early on, and this is what blows the whole thing wide open. With it, you can teleport any character or item, anywhere within sight. The sheer amount of battlefield and exploration applications were enough for me to force all my party members to learn it. Teleport party members across chasms, onto vantage points. Teleport distant enemies to kill zones, environmental hazards, or on top of one another.   Another beautiful example is the dialogue system. Namely - dialogue only freezes the characters that are actively engaged in said dialogue. Whilst your main character is speaking to a soon-to-be-hostile NPC, the rest of your party can get into position, set up traps and hazards, pickpocket the distracted NPC, or even teleport them around the map, all before combat even starts.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is very exploitable by nature. The amount of cheese strategies available to creative players is utterly disgusting - and this is clearly intentional, and I love Larian for it. I watched a video that involved the almost useless Telekinesis skill, which is used solely for moving and picking up objects at the distance - used to instagib monsters and NPCs by way of shoving an ultra-heavy crate filled with other, ultra-heavy crates.  You can customize your characters to a laudable degree, even with the option of making them Undead, which of course brings all sorts of wacky interactions, such as having to steal faces not to be attacked on sight, being damaged by healing  but healed by poison. You can create your characters if you wish, or you can use pre-built characters the game already has. In truth, there is no downside to this. The advantage of pre-built characters is that they have their own voice actors, personalities and, critically, personal quests which they progress through along with the game's main quest. You can customize everything else about them during character creation - class, attributes, even appearance. There are very few upsides to playing a non-pre-built character.  You can have a party of up to 4 characters (there are 6 pre-built characters), or up to two Lone Wolves(a talent which makes characters stronger, but limits them to a party of two). You must choose a -main- character, though you can choose any among your party to partake in dialogue. You will largely see the world through the eyes of your chosen main character.   tl;dr - A blast. I was foolish not to have realized it before.    The Story and Characters Larian has always had a distinct style that blends fantasy and humor. In that, they remain entertaining as ever. The story, as I've said before, took a while before showing what it is truly about, but once it did, it remained engaging throughout. The plot itself isn't as good as an Obsidian would make it, and the characters are more threadbare than Bioware would craft them - but they're good, make no mistake.  I've heard some confusion from longtime fans of the Divinity series about if this game is a prequel or a sequel to some earlier games in the franchise. There doesn't seem to be much consensus, as it could be either, with radically different implications for each possibility. As a person who hasn't played the games that more directly tie into this one, such as Divine Divinity and the Dragon Knight games, things can sometimes seem disjointed and barely explained. Lucian, the Black Ring, Deathfog and the fall of the elven kingdoms, Source and Sourcerers(and how it is different from ordinary magic), Godwoken - It all took a while to fit into place.   And Malady? I was profoundly confused. I like the character, but she seems to drop from the sky at the end of Act I and takes the reins of the entire plot with little to no explanation about the whos, whys and whats. And- heck, Windego, the game's intro narrator. Why she narrates the plot, and seems to take such an important role in narrating the ending - is a mystery.  The game's characters are mostly serviceable. The pre-built party members are a cut above the rest. Well, all except Beast. I remain disappointed how dwarves are depressingly similar in all of fantasy. Putting on a pirate hat doesn't make one different enough. They even have elves in Divinity be gangly cannibalistic weirdos - but dwarves remain dwarves.  The endings are also a disjointed mess, full of moving parts and stuffed at the end of a final battle that ends rather abruptly(and lets not forget the blatantly defective or just badly designed Anathema questline, which pays off about as much as the Mutated Toe in Fallout 2). Still, there's no denying that they're a better payoff than, let's say, Tyranny's endings.  The cRPG genre has fierce competition in story and writing, and I believe that Larian found a handy way to go about things: The interveawing between the main plot and the individual (pre-built)character stories. The grandiose story runs the risk of making a protagonist feel like a nameless, faceless nobody that murderhobos his way to the end - but each character's personal quest is craftily sewn into the world's larger story, which gives precious context and a feeling of being connected to the game's events. This shouldn't be overlooked.   Finally, Original Sin's Pet Pal talent returns triumphantly, allowing you to speak to each and every animal in the game, which not only grants you access to tons of new quests and content, but also up the comedic factor by several orders of magnitude. I will never forget the amazing bringing the sole survivor chick Peeper on an epic journey to find his Sourcerer father, the epic rooster Magicockarel.   In Conclusion It's pretty good! A mechanics-focused cRPG that teleports you‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•first into a barrel of fun."
Moogie,171,2,0,"September 25, 2017",Recommended,97.9,"Loved the first game, despite its flaws. I feel like this game fixes every issue the first game had and across the board improves on it - my hat off to Larian Studios for listening to feedback.   While the story and setting is darker, there is so much humor sprinkled into this game. With the addition of voice acting, I find myself listening to everything. I didn't know how to feel about the narration at first, but it has grown on me and I feel like it's a great addition to the game. The Origin stories are a neat touch, I am doing my first playthrough as Lohse and I feel like mine is the most interesting of the group. Definitely want to try Fane next.  Overall, its a beautiful game with great little details hidden everywhere. (Also the music is great)  I have a hard time coming up with any real criticisms of the game, but I will try. I wish there was a better loot system - i play ranged and I just never get to loot anything, which isn't very fun. Some of the quests I've run into were bugged, so that's a bummer but I'm sure they'll be fixed in the near future and I can do them on my Tactician playthrough. I feel like playing with 4 people pulls the game into too many directions, I miss stuff that other people are doing and everyone wants to have the feeling of exploration - that's not really a game flaw, I just think it'd be a better experience with 1-2 players."

Divinity: Original Sin 2 is competing very closely with my all-time favorite game, Divinity 2: Ego Draconis/Flames of Vengeance. There are so many avenues for replayability, discovery, and enjoyment in DOS2.   I love and treasure all the interactions, the story, the combat, everything. This is one of the most perfect games ever made to me. I highly suggest waiting for the anticipated Definitive Edition which will be coming out soon."

"Suddenly, Potatoes",87,2,0,"October 15, 2017",Recommended,35.5,"20 ways to accomplish almost all of the tasks.  Some you can eff up and not be able to do and must approach another way.  Hell, maybe you even ruined that ability to DO this task now.  You can't Skyrim it and toss your face into the brick wall over and over, or follow an arrow that coddles you till you win with confetti.   There are loads of combinations for character builds to START with.  Yes, start with.  You can absolutely change things up later on.  Play a sword-and-board warrior with no spells...but realize that raising the dead and slinging lightning is hella boss?  Cool, pump a point or two into those stats so you can use spells.  I haven't even GOTTEN FAR ENOUGH yet, but heard there is a way to respec your characters entirely eventually.  So don't worry about grinding new gameplays to get what you want.  Though...that's not always bad, since there are so many outcomes to every single encounter in this game that you can't see everything in one go.  Loads-a-loot, too.  You'll be literally defending yourself with wooden planks roped into a sheild, and knives on a a stick (that's the actual crafted name) and work your way to legendary and unique weapons to genuinely suck the life from enemies and light them on fire.  PS, seamless multiplayer in a free-roam/turn-based game that has damn near no limitiations I've seen so far.  No rope sticking MP members together at all times.  Travel wherever you want, talk, fight, etc...and don't worry about snagging your buddy away from his task to join you;  they have freedom even when you are a world away fighting.

Avascar,117,2,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,209.2,"What's makes an RPG? This game exceeds almost all of my expecations, and wipes away all of my fears. Engrossing writing, lovable characters, engaging combat, challenging choices, great soundtrack, and CO-OP. It's hard for me to not love this game in every aspect. And surely, it's a game that's difficult to top. Do note I will mostly talk about the main campaign, because it's what I put the most hours into.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a video game designed to look into your very soul, and asks a very direct question, 'Who are you?'. You can make a custom character, or one of the six origin characters (with specific dialogue, unique quests, and a generally different experience), and take part in an adventure alone, with NPC companions (with their own personality and relationship with you), or actual players. It goes back to the roots of RPG's, and gives you ultimate freedom to do and be whoever you want to be. To be whatever or whoever you want. And your choices matter, for every kill and every choice changes the world in some way. The world is real. You're in an adventure.  From the voice acted merchants, to the bustling cities and towns, you'll manage to find every nook and cranny as this game is filled with secrets only meant for the die-hard explorers. Different dialogue choices, hidden quests, OP loot, completely different outcomes; the world reacts to how you behave and what you know. Whether you decide to become the traditionalist hero, to the megalomaniac villian. The choice is ultimately up to you, and the game respects that. No choice nor fight is as black and white as they seem, as everyone in the story is both good and bad in their own rights (probably with the exception of the source king). It's a game you can't really have a ""perfect run"" on, choices will grant many different and branching choices based on what you do.  It goes back to the roots of RPGs from the days of Dungeons & Dragons, takes the modernism of current RPGs, and dosed with the whimsical love from Larian into a game that twists you as a whole, showing your true colors. In Co-op, it tests your relationships with your friends, as you must know only one out of the four adventurers can be Divine. It's a game that's both cooperative and yet slightly competitive, and it adds great storytelling to the entire experience.  Not only does the game contain loads of different dialogue, secrets, choices, and outcomes, it has some of the most revolutionary turn-based combat I've seen. Environmental effects from fire, rain, poison, and water. You can spend hours strategizing with your friends setting up the battlefields, as almost every enemy have their own weaknesses and strengths you must overcome. Each fight is interesting to their core, making you adapt to each situation in geography, location, environment, skills, and enemy types.  I only recently completed this game, and I realize it's one of those few games I'll have really fond moments of. It's a game where as soon as you beat it, you'll immediately start another run. I wouldn't mind paying for expansions, because the level of quality that Larian provides is amazingly superb. I don't want to give many spoilers to the game, it is full of many surprises that you must experience yourself. It's unforgettable, I tell you!  Of course, this game isn't perfect. Bugs are rather prevalent, as you literally can't get some achievements. Aside from bugs, I do wish there was more character development between my companions. This isn't an issue when all of your characters are actual people. But when they're NPC companions they don't talk very often, only during specific and important story scenes. If you play solo, there will be times when you don't notice their presence because they never have any dialogue to say, which is a shame in my opinion. I won't dabble on it much, but Act 4 is a bit lame as there isn't as much depth to it compared to Act 1 and 2. This entry of the series also messes up the timeline of the games, which puzzles many previous players like me. And the final boss isn't as magnificant as I wanted it to be (no multiple boss phases!?!).  There's also the Arena mode, which is an online PvP game mode. It's pretty dead, and it seems to be the most rushed out of the 3 (Campaign, Arena, and Game Master). You can only select a few presets of characters (no character nor skill customization), and in my experience I had trouble finding a match to play. I wouldn't play this for the Arena mode because it's pretty awful. The idea is great, but the execution just isn't there.  I also haven't managed to play much of the Game Master mode. A game mode that's quite literally Dungeons and Dragons. There's a rather small following for it, and there are custom campaigns out you can play right now. And from the looks of it, seems very fun. The combat is very streamlined, and the numbers are very easy to manage. I find it better than the use of spreadsheets, very long text documents, or literally piles of papers in my experience. But ultimately, it's personal preference.  But aside from that, everything about this game is fantastic. OST (Main theme, Rivellon, all the character theme songs), aesthetics (perhaps the humans and dwarves are a bit ugly looking), storytelling, dialogue, choices, secrets, combat, mod support, and so much more. Don't think my critiques give you the impression that they ruin the entire experience, because they don't. In the end, you'll feel like you finished an adventure. You mold the game, and yet the game molds you. The world of Rivellon reacts to your moves, with its inner gears shifting and moving. You will tell countless stories of it, I assure you.  So, what makes an RPG? The storytelling experience. And a storytelling experience that allows you to be in the eyes of a child, becoming whoever or whatever you want and having your choices matter in a significant way is an astonishing feat all on its own.  And that, is why I would easily give this game a 10/10. Simply revolutionary."

It is out of all the games I've purchased recently, the most rewarding for the money I spent in time and enjoyment its given me, and I'm not even finished with the game. Far from it.

This leads to me often skipping conversations, and suddenly I'm declared a hero, and have 10 people attacking me. This could be catastrophic, but as I said, I always loot. Turns out drinking tea and spend half the match eating random items is a very good strategy.   My co-op partner in crime is not a looter, but actually reads the dialogue. Working together is thus a very good way of playing. He gets all the story + depth of the game while I get to spend more time around looting.   A tip tho: Distribute the loot, quite impractical when the team member with all the healing + scrolls manages to set herself on fire and die... 3 attempts in a row.

As an example of the freedom provided, here is an example quest you would encounter: There is an <enemy> you were sent to kill because he stole the <quest giver's> <item> and you are to return said item to the quest giver:  - receive objective and start quest - straight up complete quest the way it was asked of you - OR talk to someone the ""right"" way and learn info that complicates things - OR find evidence through explorations that complicates/benefits/hinders things - OR depending on what character you chose in the beginning, <quest giver> or <enemy> might have history with you and attack/help/trust/not trust/give additional quest/etc - OR you had already stumbled upon that <enemy> and killed him already so you get the reward - OR you had already stumbled upon that <enemy> and he gave you a quest to kill the <quest giver> before the <quest giver> could talk to you - OR you decide to lie to <quest giver> and say you killed <enemy> but he didn't have the item just to get a half reward - OR persuade <enemy> to just give you the item back and leave town/apologize/fake his death/etc - OR you kill <enemy> and tell <quest giver> that <enemy> didn't have the item on him and you keep the item for yourself - OR you sneak up and pickpocket <enemy> and take <item> without killing him and return the <quest giver> and return <item> (and/or lie about killing <enemy>) - OR you kill/steal from <enemy>, return <item> to <quest giver>, recieve reward, THEN pickpocket <quest giver> and take the item back for yourself - OR tell the guards that <enemy> stole and the guards will kill him for you  - OR lure <enemy> near the guards, get <enemy> to attack you, and have the guards finish him - OR teleport <enemy> to <quest giver> with a power you learned and get them to fight it out themselves - etc etc etc  That's just the options with this one scenario. There are many more diverse quests that you can use your imagination + character skills + game mechanics to solve in a way that seems natural, inventive, beneficial, or just fun. This is expounded when you add in the Game Master mode that essentially lets you control every aspect of the game (map, story, dialogue, enemies, items, encounters, hidden secrets, etc etc) and even dnd aspects like die rolls for choices/actions to allow literally whatever solution you can imagine.  I haven't even touched the diversity of combat or skills or items or interactivity of the world or the many different paths you can take in the game, but there are plenty of other reviews that go in depth on those.

Ridiculous Primate,17,2,0,"October 30, 2017",Recommended,276.4,"This game is one of my favorites of all time now. The world is immersive and beautiful.  The battles are challenging yet rewarding.  I played through it on Tactician mode  out of the gate because I beat the first game on Tactician mode and figured I'd master this in no time too.  The difficulty was surprising at times.  But one thing that I really liked about the difficulty was that it didn't rely on RNG for everything.  There are a few RNG elements, but for the most part the fights are designed to be beaten by strategy and predicting what the enemies would do. The over arching story was pretty classic, but what made me really love it was the companion stories.  They were really interesting and I really loved them.  Some people on here have commented that the companions don't interact much, and while I would have loved for them to interact more than they did, I feel like their stories cross over a lot.  For example Sebille and the Red Prince's stories straight up merge near the end if you are playing with them both in the party. I would suggest taking Lohse in your party too, because her personal quest is one of the best. I know there are still some bugs, and those can be frustrating. I know it uses some classic tropes, but classic tropes are classic for a reason.  Sometimes when you try  to reinvent the wheel you end up making a block of rock. The game also does successfully reinvent the wheel at a few points. I played it all through tactician mode and felt it was a good difficulty considering I took the hardest option.  If you are playing a game on the hardest setting you should expect to have to fight some fights multiple times to master them, and it makes me so happy that I never felt like I was just flipping a coin to win a fight.  Every decision in fights matters a lot. It's not a perfect game, but no game has ever been perfect.  This game is pretty damn good though, and if they fixed the broken quests and bugs I would put it in my top 5 RPGs instantly.  My major complaint about this game is that there isn't more of it.  I can't wait for some DLC."
Atara Mos,174,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,147.3,"I had played the prior game and was encouraged to pick this game up in Beta because of the promise of having more than just one friend join you. In the Beta alone I have over 30 hours of play time, and we barely got out of the first area. That isn't a bad thing at all! That is a testament to the variety of ways that you can do things. We wanted to try all the different classes, the different racial traits, the different talents. The addition of a single talent can entirely change how the story plays out, which dramatically increases replayability. You're presented with multiple ways to resolve your quests, and each are different and can have influence on multiple aspects of your character. Despite the 30+ hours in beta I still found entirely new things in release.  The story is rich and deep because of how so much of your character influences different interactions and what you find along the way. The combat being turn based is a lot more thoughtful than just running up and bashing your strongest skill, you can truly use the environment to your advantage, or accidentally screw yourself over with it if you aren't careful.  It really harkens back to the classic rpgs of the past in such a great way.  My only real critique is that the learning curve is sort of steep to start, camera movement isn't the most intuitive and takes a bit to figure out the finessing of it, as the tutorial is minimal. This can lead to some funny interactions, though, as you figure out that maybe red outlined things aren't the best thing to click on with others around."
No Name Salted Butter,156,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,62.7,"Easily one of the best RPG's ever made.  To me it has a feel similar to the fable titles with the freedom you get (within reason) during a dungeon and dragons session.   The combat is tactical and challenging while also rewarding, the characters are interesting, the world is beautiful and fleshed out, and overall the game once it was fully released is polished and well worth the wait and money put into it.   The game master mode is also a welcomed addition, only adds to value of the game."

Mahebra,291,2,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,238.5,"Improves on the original in every way.  Original Sin 1 was probably one of the best CRPGs I had ever played to that date, and I could find little to no flaws with it, many of which were improved upon in the Enhanced Edition of the game.   Original Sin 2 somehow manages to take that mastercraft and make it even better, the new systems and mechanics implemented in such a way that I find it almost hard to return to the original. I have spent an absurd amount of time on the Early Access alone, and cannot believe the amount of variety and feasability to the different ways to approach each situation.   I was a bit taken back by the new changes to the armor system -- having physical and/or magical armor protects you (and your enemies) from those CC abilities, which made the first game a bit of a race to CC the enemies before they could do it to you. Original Sin 2 found a interesting way to handle that, and building your team and skillset to tackle this new problem has made the combat far more interesting and more satisfying, while not over complicating things. Instead of a party make-up being almost required, you're now a bit more free to experiment with your set up, and the changes to the skill system allows you to experiment more with being a hybrid build, instead of having to take a strict path in order to maximize gains.  This game seems far more friendly to newer players, while still keeping much of the spice and charm that I've come to expect and love from Larian, and this newest entry has done nothing but please and delight me."

Every aspect is of such high quality: the dialogue, the voice acting, the music, the excellent UI, the art style, the graphics, the amazing combat mechanics, the sense of exploration and adventure, the level design, the encounter design, the pacing... it's all super well done, way above what you normally get in an rpg.   There's such a large amount of things to find, places to explore, animals to talk to (If you have the required talent) and let‚Äôs not forget, towns filled with victims to pickpocket!   There are so many different classes you can have and you're not limited in any way, you could be a rogue necromancer or a tank archer if you wanted.   I'm 60+ hours in and it has not gotten tedious or started to feel formulaic or repetitive, which is something that I've never seen happen in a long single player game either.  The side stories, environments and things you do are varied enough to feel fresh after 60+ hours, the sense of exploration and adventure never goes away.   Every time you level up or progress further in the story you are rewarded with new spells and abilities that keep expanding on the combat and allowing you to experiment and try new builds and tactics, which keeps you from falling into familiar combat patterns/habits and keeps you entertained.   Watch on youtube some gameplay, buy the game. This is one game you won‚Äôt regret buying.  "

I played the first one with my girlfriend and the co-op experience of two Lone Wolves was amazing, the second part is the same but with more content, nothing more.  Pros:  - Split Screen for PC - Very good Graphics - Unique storytelling and situations. - Best combat in a RPG so far (Sorry for the RTWP lovers) - Pet Pal Talent - Wells - Very good customization of characters, the magic mirror is amazing. - Very well optimized, the game runs smooth with a GTX770 in ultra, only few freezes in split screen.  Cons:   - ORIGINS, I don't like premade characters, if you choose lone wolf you skip a very big part of the game. - No Linux support. Seriously Larian? I needed to make a partition only to play the game. - Poor localization. I'm a native spanish speaker (I'm from Spain), for me english is not an issue but it is for my girlfriend...  Anyways, the game is one of the best RPG ever made, for me it's better than BG2 and Vampire: TMB.   Buy it if you can spend a lot of hours in one game, and be prepared for a tragic-humoristic situations, it worths the price."

You have to follow the quest by yourself, with no obvious quest markers or whatsoever. You need to click every NPC here and there to proceed and the NPCs give you other quests along the way, you end up with more quests in your hand, which is awesome. It doesn't feel forced like some games do, the quests comes naturally to you and there are plenty of ways to do them, or not to. It's like playing one of those table-top RPGs.

The first Original Sin was good, but this is something else, something more polished and fun to play.  Unlike many newer RPG's, this game doens't have that much handholding. It lets you explore the world and figure out things by yourself without much obvious spoonfeeding. Also, your actions have some weight on how things play out. Don't save a seemingly unimportant NPC early on and it might come back to bite you later on.  The world itself is quite interactable. Not only are there loads of things lying around for you to rummage through and steal. There are also plenty of environmental effects like puddles of water or blood giving you the chance of electrifiying it and anyone standing in it. Oil can be lit aflame, as does poison. You can let it rain to douse the flames, creating steam. Obviously your characters will also get wet because of the rain. A campfire will then again warm up your characters. All these effects are certainly fun to mix up and don't feel that gimmicky like in the first Original Sin.  Lastly and quite importantly: the inhabitants of the world feel quite alive, the story unfolds nicely, the dialogue is top notch and your party members are delightfully in depth.  Highly recommended for any RPG lover. Otherwise still a rock solid game."

The interface, inventory and crafting are much easier to use now and won't have multiple windows of inventory, which was kind of annoying in the first game. Though, the crafting is not as useful as the first game due to the fact that this iteration throws money and items at you like there's no tommorow.  The combat system in general I feel is harder to cheese in this game thanks to the addition of physical and magical armor, and will take a bit more effort to crowd control enemies, which makes the game more challenging and balanced than the first one, even though some people may disagree as aoe's, especially late game, are so overpowered. Summons are also not as powerful as the first game, which used to be too good for distracting enemies.  The first 4/5's of the game are really well designed, particularly Fort Joy. You'll be surprised to see just how many ways there are to escape the prison.  My only gripe with this game is its last part, in the city of Arx and the ending as the game loses its excellent momentum and pace. There, you may encounter some bugs and performance issues, as well as the story getting too messy and somewhat of a lackluster final boss battle in comparison with the first game.  Also, not that the game is smaller or shorter than the first one, quite the contrary, but the world just ""feels"" smaller. It feels as if you were playing in your backyarden for a really long stretch of the game, particularly in act II. DOS 1 had so much variety in its areas and enemies and it really felt like you were travelling all of Rivellon throughout the game, DOS 2 is a little lacking in this area. Kind of a shame you dont get to fight more interesting voidwoken and those fights are really scarce.  But all in all, definetely worth the asking price, which is not much and will net you at least 100 hours if you complete it. This studio needs more support, and they might make this game even better with the free definitive edition, maybe even surpass DOS 1 enhanced edition."

Sure one might actually have to read a few things, but if you like some elements of old RPG games with todays world of graphics, this is an awesome game.  The choices are well thought through, with many options available based on who is simply talking.  It is not a click anywhere type of choice, as you don't get to go back and chose the right path after failing the 3 bad choices.  In that regard the game pace is slowed down. Battles take time to rethink and strategize.   Sometimes you just are not ready, and you need to find better equipment.  The combat systems is pretty much about putting out more damage than the other team can heal and deliver back.  If you ventured into a higher level, there is a good chance you will simly die.  That challange makes it hard to figure out, if you have not found the right strategy or if you need to wait.  Great game.  Well done.

I'm a huge fan of Dungeons and Dragons, I have a group that plays every week, and for the days when I'm not playing, this is the game that will scratch that itch.  There is so much to say about the game even in the small amount I've played, but the long and the short of it is that the sheer amount of choice it gives you is incredible. Already between my two campaigns I've seen large changes between interactions with characters, different quests, and different class combos. I'm very excited to see everything this game has to offer.  And as a final point, I can't believe that this is an Indie game. In my opinion, this is as entertaining as almost any triple A I've played in the last fair while. I believe anyone who enjoys the fantasty/adventure/D&D genre will enjoy this game, absolutely worth the buy!"
Ihnspyre,193,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,23.3,"This is a cRPG done right:  -  awesome graphics -  fantastic combat and background mechanics -  a lot of freedom -  nice voice acting -  very nice soundtrack  The game is a must buy, Larian did almost everything right in the production department, they listened to critics from the first game, they responded positively to suggestions from fans and worked a lot to improve their game.   This game is exactly that, a very WELL MADE cRPG BUT it lacks a few things that some cRPG fans love about the genre.   Firstly, nothing you see in this game is especially interesting from an artistic point of view. The maps are quite big and full of quests and things to do but there aren't too many WAH moments where you can just admire the artistic design of the map. They are mostly FUNCTIONAL and full of content but uninteresting. While games like Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity have awesome dungeon designs, awesome towns (Twin Elms etc.) and fantastic visual landscapes, D:OS 2 has classic maps with meh design and a lot of secrets.   Most of the game has a lighthearted style of writing, classic personalities for characters, kind of boring lore and story. There aren't too many memorable moments throughout the game (I got very close to the end of the game before getting bored of it on another shared account, bought it for Larian deserved support and future updates + multiplayer) and it really does nothing special except for the combat and mechanics (which are great!). The thing is that we are used to cRPGs full of bugs or questionable developer attitude and when an RPG like D:OS 2 comes out, without a lot of bugs, with a lot of content and fantastic gameplay, well, we tend to overrate it.   The humour was okay, not good and not bad. The party dynamics is not as good as Pillars of Eternity and that cRPG is more suitable for my taste (with complex lore and story, a lot of party interaction, fantastic artistic design and soundtrack).   Overall, Larian deserve a lot of support for being awesome hardworking devs but not for imagination, originality or artistic skills."

Best when playing with another player (up to 3 additional players). Tons of lore, story, and ways to deal with most situations. Lots of freedom in how you want to play the game.   Downside is that combat isn't as frequent and leveling does tend to be on the slower side. You'll spend more time gearing up or chatting than doing anything else. Enemies, in general, are on the weaker side, so sometimes combat doesn't feel as rewarding.   Fun moments: -Trying to break into the ship's kitchen ends with the entire ship blowing up. -Battling asssassins in one motel room, while listening to npcs in another room talk about their love life.  -The moment my cousin and I realize the food we've been eating was made of the local law enforcement that continues to go missing.  -The moment my cousin and I realize what the gods were planning leading to a an epic betrayal of all betrayals.  -Failing to save a family from an execution leading to all out war in the oil fields.  -Realizing the badguys at the end had a very reasonable endgame to their scheme that would have led to the best kind of ending you could get in the game.  -Having my cousin backstab me as I attempt to take Divinity for myself (I won't forget this cuz.

YagDridge,191,2,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,32.8,"This game is a true gem. I really enjoyed Divinity: Original Sin but it had many flaws that made my playstyles limited difficulty wise. In this game all those minor/big issues I had with the series is gone.  One of my favorite things about this game is all the dialog options and more are available depending on your race, and tags. The random things you can do and play with your own style to pass are just amazing and leave me with a complete immersive feeling at all times. I'm still in the tutorial zone at nearly 9 hours because im taking it nice and slow while reading all that dialog. A somewhat early review but I've already noticed ALL my nitpicks from the first game have been addressed in this game.  Major improvements that I love from the last game: + More Dialog choices + Recruiting any new member gives you the choice to select their class allowing for a party of your choice as well + Selling an item worth a lot of money gives you quick reputation with traders + Killing someone in town away from everyone doesn't make the entire world hate you in this game + New Classes/Undead! + Very informative tutorial + New armor/movement/combat system that feels perfected for turn based + Inventory enhancements making it really easy to deal with all party members quickly + Co-op + 4 Players + Crafting"
Lobster Dominance Hierarchy,30,2,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,364.3,"Great game! The Larian team has done it again. I'm happy for them, especially considering the studios history when they were taken advantage of in the past. I particularly like the shout outs and throwbacks to the DOS1, and I'm no where near done the game yet. If you are wanting a role playing strategy game where you actually interact with your companions, and who have their own motives/goals then this is the game for you.  Pros: - More skills. Dear God the old game was lacking in skill variety, really noticable late game. Good to see they improved this. - Diologue is great! - Lore is great! - Deatail in game world - Humor, and a at times snarky narrator - Different ways of solving a quest  Pro/Con: - Graphicks are amazing as ever, but lag the heck out of your computer when you are in the forest/city and not in a building - Crafting is more streamlined but waaaay harder when experimenting as it's less straightforward as DOS1. Good/bad I don't know.  Cons: - Still a little bugy/brocken quests. Nothing too serious as there is ushally a work around. But I came accross my first broken quest bug in Act 2, as in no way to start it as item didn't appear in inventory. Also the game sometimes crashes, so be sure to save often, especially if you open up a new window to google something.  So there you have it a great game, and dare I say if the studio waited a month to release the game to fix these bugs the game may have even been called immaculate? Hope it gets some more patches soon!  EDIT: A little deeper into the game and a little saltier at some of the bugs, *cough* tarquin *cough* as I found a few more broken quest bugs. This game is definitely released a month too early. Still a great game... just waiting on some more patches..."

Dragona,215,2,0,January 11,Recommended,231.8,"Overall, I really enjoyed this game. I loved the interaction with my companions and helping them with their personal quests. The main story was enjoyable but felt really rushed towards the end. I felt the final part of the game was a bit rushed in general. For example, I expected more from Arx. It felt small for a city (it didn't even have an inn!) and had a lot of wasted potentials which could have included more quests, storylines and more companion interaction. I loved the romance options in the game too as it felt more immersive but from Arx onwards, it seemed a bit lacklustre and the epilogue at the end was a bit of a let down as it felt as if any romance was dismissed to have a 'one-size fits all ending'. Also, I'm sure I'm not the only one who found Sebille very buggy regarding romance if you had her in your party but were not romancing her. She would seem to force kisses on you even if you were just being nice but still turning down her advances. Other than these grievances, I really enjoyed the game as I found combat to be very fun and at times, challenging. I completed it on classic difficulty so I'm hoping tactician will be challenging to progress. I also loved being able to build my character in any way I choose. My custom character ended up with a support/summoner/caster hybrid which was a lot of fun to play. I've also played some co-op which most ends up being hilarious with friends which usually ends up with us all being on a murder spree around Fort Joy due to one person's inability to steal successfully.  If I were to summarise: +Enjoyable story +Great companion interaction (wish there was more of it towards the end!) +Romance is great for adding a new dynamic to your companions. +Great combat +Great character customisation regarding class builds etc  -A lot of bugs that are immersion breaking or require a reload. -Feels rushed in the final act -No mention of the romance you created in the final epilogue  I would love to see a further expansion to this game, for example, being able to go to the desert areas that Prince or Ifan are originally from but understand that the multiple endings would make this difficult.

Darth Jar Jar,9,2,2,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,120.2,"I'm a big fan of looting. This game is the ultimate loot-game. I always loot everything.  I'm also a very impatient person. This leads to me often skipping conversations, and suddenly I'm declared a hero, and have 10 people attacking me. This could be catastrophic, but as I said, I always loot. Turns out drinking tea and spend half the match eating random items is a very good strategy.   My co-op partner in crime is not a looter, but actually reads the dialogue. Working together is thus a very good way of playing. He gets all the story + depth of the game while I get to spend more time around looting.   A tip tho: Distribute the loot, quite impractical when the team member with all the healing + scrolls manages to set herself on fire and die... 3 attempts in a row.   Just waiting for the loot from the kickstarter now.

Owning Duck,73,2,0,"November 2, 2017",Recommended,364.0,"This game is now my most favorite game, I played DOS twice, one playthrough by myself (150 hours) and one with my friend (60 hours). I can say that I really enjoyed the first game and was really looking forward to DOS 2. I'm almost 200 hours into it and I am not even done with the campaign. But being nearly done I think I can give a proper review.  Combat: So most people criticize the game for being turn-based rather than a real-time with pause function. But it feels right in place as the combat still feels so engaging. The combat is tougher since a lot of skills that you have, the enemies have as well. This makes the combat harder but also more rewarding once you get past it. The game is hard yet fair. There are fights that seem impossible but the game provides us with the tools to win or hides the tools within the world. A lot of the skills feel strong and useful. But towards the end game, I find that magic damage started to be more obsolete as it is much faster and easier to physical as that it the most reliable way to damage. Though that might be because my team consisted of 3 physical dealers and one wizard.  Story: This is by far my favorite part of the game. The story is rather simple yet done in a way that makes it compelling. And as someone who played the other Divinity games, there are a lot of surprising plot twists that I was surprised by. But where the game shines the most is the origin stories. You can either create your own character or choose one of 6 pre-made origin characters that have their own backgrounds. And and these stories are very well-written with equally well made characters. It is so interesting to see how much the game changes because of who you are. If you didn't pick an origin character, you can still recruit them but after a certain point, they will become unavaible. It is a rather intersting thing of being a side character to the origin character's stories though. And each origin chracter will have a personal quest which will result in some drastic endings. But some advice, do not play as Lohse. Not because she is bad, she is a great character with a one of my favorite stories. But Lohse is best when played as a companion and her personal ending yields the best reward a video game has ever given.  UI: I will be blunt about it, it's bad. Inventory management is a nightmare. Sadly it is also required in powering up your weapons in the end game. You will spend a long time in your inventory looking through it to find a single item. Crafting can be done through a seperate menu but most of the time you will be combing random stuff together and that is horrible. In the end game, you will have so much clutter mostly involving books and paper with no swift and reliable way to dispose of them.   Other Notes: The game has quite alot of bugs as well. The first area will be rather polished because it was in early access for a long time. But the game is large and some parts are even broken at times. But I would like to say that I have not faced a bug bad enough to take away from my enjoyment. The game is best played (in my opinion) with a roll with it attitude. Just accept mistakes that happen. It is really fun to see all my mistakes bite me in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•later down the line. And before I forget, the soundtrack. It is a masterpiece. DOS 2 has a different composer from the past Divinity games (RIP Kirill) but the new composer has truly put his heart and soul into it and it is an absolute joy to listen to.   Just buy the game. Larian deserves all of the praise and hopefully they will make a console version so we all can share in the masterpiece that is Divinity Original Sin."

.Milk,57,2,0,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,125.9," Divinity: Original Sin II   Release:  September 14, 2017   Genre:  RPG  Mode:  Single-player, Multiplayer   Gameplay:   > 60 hours   Achievements:   Easy  |  Medium  | Hard   Rating:  10/10     ""Everything you choose and do has its consequences.""   Strategy is the key to complete this game. The game already begins at your character creation screen, where there are options like: Race, Talents, Abilities, Skills, Class etc. given to you. Everything you choose from here on will change the way you interact with the world. This makes this game so unbelievably huge. You can interact with literally everyone, you have the option to kill or spare one's life, there are multiple ways to complete a quest etc. But the most important thing of all: ""eveything you choose to do has its consequenses."" For instance, if you scold a character he will not like you therefore he won't trade with you no more. Or if you kill a character, you won't be able to finish a questline. Or you found a strange animal somewhere across the map which gained your liking and therefore he want to accompany you.   This game is exactly what a RPG should be. Combat, story, freedom, humour and most of all the freedom to interact with everything."
Hawkness,100,2,1,August 31,Recommended,372.8,Divinitively the best RPG ever made and done by a great game studio who really cares about their players. I will surely support their future projects.
pinkpinnn,248,2,0,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,122.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 - 2017 GEM.  Finding a game that mixes RPG, D&D, customizable class/ characters, good story telling, beautiful aesthetics, crafting system, tactical turn based battle, and option to play co-op? This game pretty much offers it all up on a silver plate.  I've played the first Divinity Original Sin, and my impression of that wasn't so strong, however I decided to give this a try, and it definitely floored me.  None too many games I've played have done a swell job in buffing lores, stories, and open ended quests for you to explore. You don't have to be a lore-lover or a rouge type gamer to enjoy this. There's a sweet spot for everyone. I went looking for a plain old adventure-with-consequences game, and spent more time reading up short lores here and there instead of speeding through it.  I can't believe I've spent 80+ hours (solo play) and still haven't completed it yet. Actually for the first chapter, I managed to spend 8-9 hours (and this was just purely exploring and figuring out quests). Halfway through the game, it even conjured up my nostalgia for Dragon Age 1.   CONS/ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  -Sometimes there are NO warnings before huge consequences take place. And when it happens, it's too late to alter (unless you are bothered to load up a game save 1 hour ago+). This happened a few times for me, the most painful one for me being: I couldn't take my companions to the next chapter because I'd missed that one window to convince them. They were absolutely gone. I loaded a previous save, but ever since that happened, I ended up tracking quests on wikia instead in fear of a major slip up -Quest journals are sometimes vague, and you will be left wondering or wiki-ing what the next step should be -Some quests feel un-finished or un-polished, as there may only be ONE, OBSCURE way of completing it -Not a must, but nice to have: Camera angle needs more rotation flexibility -No option to hide the HUD  PROS:  -The battle system constantly makes you look for the best spots to prepare and engage. Whenever you think you've got your ""go-to"" strategies nailed down, the game manages to switch it up just a little to make it challenging (+fun) again -Attention to detail towards the environment and the overall atmosphere. I don't always stop and look at the shadows of leaves and trees in a game. Each chapter is a map with it's own characteristics -Memorable background sound and music <3 Well done Borislav Slavov  -EVERY character has a voice! And voice acting is just ace -Main companions have decent back stories, although 1 or 2 still seem like pompous ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s after 20 hours -HIGH replayability value -Co-op offers extra fun if you want play with you rmates, and most things work smoothly. Just take note of the connectivity menu, and make sure to set your game privacy, as random people can enter your game and hijack your acharacter completely. -Dungeon master mode! For those who are into D&D this might be an interesting mode to check out  TO THINK THIS GAME WAS BACKED BY A KICK STARTER AND DEVELOPED + LAUNCHED UNDER 3 YEARS!  It's not easy balancing and taking in multiple opinions and ideas and delivering on something this decent. I suspect good team work somewhere in Larian Studios. The game is decent enough for me to overlook the annoying flaws (for now). And major game developing companies? You guys better brush up your A game. Top notch graphics aren't the only thing that makes a game immersive and great.  ANYWAYS...JUST...Just ..go play it!"
Sandwich Boy,400,2,0,March 13,Recommended,27.6,"This is one of the most immersive games I've played in years.  The graphics are great for a CRPG, the story is engrossing, and every line of dialogue is fully voiced.  There is so much depth in every aspect of the game.  The character customization, crafting system, and combat are some of the best I've seen in any game, let alone any CRPG.  Combat encounters are difficult without feeling unfair.  Others may feel differently, but as a casual player, I found the ""classic"" difficulty setting to be just about perfect.  Combat is turn-based, but it is sort of a mix between tactical turn-based combat, and the classic RTS-Style combat of games such as Baldur's Gate. Players are definitely rewarded for being creative in combat, so simply running the party headlong into an encounter isn't always the best strategy.  The Divinity world has some interesting twists on the generic fantasy setting.  Each quest and side quest feels unique, and characters (even minor characters), are interesting and realistic.  This game also has some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in an rpg, which is crazy, given how much dialogue there is.  The attention to detail is absolutely amazing, resulting in tons of secrets to uncover in the world, as well as complex interactions between items, characters, etc.  Here's a fun example: When a character is wounded in (or out) of combat, blood can splatter onto the ground.  This blood can be frozen, resulting in a slippery patch of ice on the ground, or struck with a bolt of lightning, shocking anyone who is touching the puddle.  The blood could also be absorbed for health by a necromancer.  Somehow the game doesn't feel like it has a steep learning curve, despite all of this richness and complexity.  There's a lot more to say, but I'll keep this review short.  If you have any interest in CRPGs, or RPGs in general, you should check this game out."

Mokona,31,2,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,22.7,"This review is just based on my first impressions of the game. Its worth getting.  There is an insane amount of skills and combos you can do that a single play through will never allow you to see all the cool stuff you can do so the replay value is high. My favorite thing I've discovered in the game is the way recruiting followers works. First you must convince them to follow you to begin with, they dont just come along because you are the ""chosen one"" or some crap. To boot if you like a character you dont have to worry about him being a mage when you are already a mage because each character asks you what you want them to be. No longer are you forced to not take your favorite npc with you or forced to play a class you dont like just to take it with you. You can finally have a balanced party full of npc you find interesting hurrah.  The only thing I would ""complain"" about is the lack of non human races. You got human, dwarf (small human), elf (vegetarian human), and lizard man (finally its not a human). Skeleton variations of all is nice to throw in but I honestly am just done with every fantacy game haveing there races be the 3 over used races, human, elf, dwarf, and then a final race being there own ""custom"" race that just turn out to be another human but blue or something like that. Glad we got lizard men but wish we had a few more.  This game has a lot of thought put into it and it somehow didn't lauch at the $60 price point, with mod support. I expected this to be as dissapointing as pillars of eternity was but just jumping into the character creation and I was already loving the game."

This will keep you busy for a long time. There are a lot of classes that you can choose from, and I mean A LOT. Nothing is set in stone, so even if you choose a class you can adjust the stats and abilities you want to start with. This alone was enough for me to create a new character a couple of times.  Then there is the story and the way it's told. Almost everything is narrated and voiced. And it's done AMAZINGLY! It's like someone is reading straight from a book that you are writing as you play along. Choices that you make shape the rest of the game for you. Good or Bad. Help or Abandon. Fight or Flee. These are all things that affect your game in a way. And the chances of you experiencing every option in one playthrough is impossible.

Bennyy,108,2,0,"November 8, 2017",Recommended,297.8,"I played through 1 game on the normal difficulty then went straight to Honor Mode. Honor Mode is a difficulty setting which you only have 1 save, and if your whole party dies, the save file is deleted. ""Man, this is pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing hard, but I already have an hour in so I should keep on going."" ""Man, I'm getting pretty far. Ima see if I can do this on my first try :D"" ""Man, this deathfog stuff is OP. Oh great now my save file has been deleted. RIP 40 hours.""  At this point you might be thinking ""Oh man that sucks did you uninstall?"" Hell no, I started another game of honor mode is what I did. This time, however, my whole party got struck with lighting and they all died. Around another 30 hours gone. ""Oh surely you had enough, right?"" OH HELL NAW, IM NOT GETTING THIS CLOSE TO MISS THE ACHIEVEMENT  Finally, I got close to the very end of the game. Anticipation filled my heart as I realized that in just mere moments I would beat the final boss and get this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing achievement.  Then I did.  During the time I spent on my Honor mode saves I had the BEST time of my life. Not only was it challenging as hell, but the story was brilliant each time I went through honor mode. I tried different characters, built them different ways, and went about the story and dialogue differently each time. I found that each playthrough of honor mode gave rich story telling with the risk that if you ""fail"" in your journey then the story still goes on (See what I mean when you get through the story yourself).  I would recommend this game to anyone who liked any D&D game, and would recommend playing like how I did: 1 time on normal difficulty 3 (or more) times on Honor mode.  First time you play the game create your own character, DO NOT choose an Origin character (Origin characters are premade characters you can play as OR just pickup later to be your companions). But I DEFINITLY recommend that the playthrough after your first you should play as the Origin Character Fane. Without spoiling much, playing as this character truly makes one see how much time has been put into the story of this game.  Anyways, this game is the best of it's kind to come out in a long time, and most likely for a while longer. I have spent a lot of time on this game and when I get bored of things like CS or LoL I will most likely comeback to Divinity Original Sin 2."

The game capitalizes on turn-based combat and does it right. The world is vast and there are countless personalities and quests to encounter. I'm only around 12 hours in and I know this game is gonna take up most of my time for the coming months. If you enjoy captivating story-telling and nail-biting action then this title is for you.  Pros: 1. Amazing story-telling that is so good you have to listen to what this person/creature has to say 2. Interesting preset characters to choose from or interact with 3. Complex but understandable progression system 4. Various spells that can change the tide of battle 5. Dozens and dozens of items that all have their purpose 6.

tigran_petrosjan,42,2,0,"August 26, 2017",Recommended,875.2,"This game has the potential to become a masterpiece. It has all the strenghts of the first game`s Enhanced Edition, offers turn-based combat and plenty elemental interactions (make it rain, aoe stun through blitz bolt - create a fire surface, throw poison onto it for a huge explosion etc.). You can play with up to four party members and can either create your own character or take one of the four (after full release six) pre-made characters. While the first game lacked in the story, this 2nd part is much better in this regard. It has a much darker tone and so far the story delivers fully. It is grim, entertaining and really complex. Also the possibility of party dialogue and getting different results when talking with different party members to certain NPCs enlagerns its richness in this regard. But the strogest point of Divinity Origial Sin has always been its combat system. And the second part adds more features to that and makes everything even better. You now have aroumr fore physical and magic damage, which you have to break first in order to inflict status elements like stunned or burning or knocked down. Also there is a height system now, that your ranged characters can use for greater range and more damage.  And last but not least the game has after the full release on the 14th of September a Game Master Mode. There you can basically develop and play your own adventures with the Divinity engine and UI. With this you can create your own D&D - campaign and play it with your friends.  Another small feature is the Arena Mode, where you can explore the combat system with pre-defined characters on several maps. All this features offer easy access to multiplayer, I have atm ver 250 hours into this already great game and multiplayer worked fine every time. I regard Divinity Original Sin 2 in the highest order. This game was highly enjoyable already in its year in Early Access although it missed some of its features.

We can also choose between the races of Human, Lizard, Elves, Dwarfs and, my personal favorite, the Undead; whatever you choose, rest assured that even just your race will have an effect on how you're viewed and treated in the world of D:OS 2.  On top of all of this, Larian has even dared to go completely beyond the conventional by implementing a fully-fledged Game Master Mode -- a feature which to me is extremely interesting, allowing up to five players to enjoy customly created campaigns as a group of up to four adventurers and one Game Master, to create the virtual equivalent of the good old Pen & Paper roleplaying experience.

Combat misadventures to follow, but the story interaction that you can have is fantastic. If one player starts talking to an NPC you can listen to the whole exchange as well, complete with the voice acted NPC dialog. You can see where your friend's cursor is as they debate what dialog choice they want to reply with- we always end up talking about which one fits our ""attitude"" the most, which is fun in and of itself. You are never standing around while someone has an awesome dialog with ""their"" quest NPC while you do nothing; you can always listen in and hear the story.  Now on to the combat. The combat is really well done, especially the environmental variables and conditions. For instance, the classic Divinity situation of use lightning or cold on someone standing in water or wet and they will be stunned or frozen respectively is great for planning out how you are going to take on a group of enemies. Until someone in your group makes it rain on the battlefield and then uses chain lightning. Now, in addition to your foe being stunned, your allies are as well. I am not saying that I have been stunned or frozen a few times, but I have been stunned or frozen a few times.  Lots of quests and side quests and NPCs to do tasks for, and lots of different ways of completing the tasks as well. We are still in our first play-through but already planning out classes for our second. One of the short comings is related to the quests, specifically the quest log. It can be difficult to discern if a quest is active only because you did a part of it out of order, such as visiting an NPC before you should have, or if you have not done the criteria of the quest. It is not game braking but it is a little bit out of place due to how good the rest of the game is, UI included."

Great Race-Class system Fully Voice Acted  Playable Undead Race Great Music Great Combat System (specially if you are into turn based combat)  Downside so far for me is the running around I have to do to get back a party member once I let go of them. I think once they join your party and you ask them to leave they all should wait at a specific location not back to where you found them.

Greendetective,47,2,0,"April 30, 2017",Recommended,127.9,I was very skeptical about this game.  How can a top down SRPG not be boring?  But after some persuasion from a friend i finally decided to buy it and play it with them and lo' and behold i was astounded by how fun this game is.  The puzzles and battles are the most strategic and amazing srpg battles I seen with environmental destruction being an awesome gimmick. The story is simple yet effective with a huge world with plenty to do and graphics are amazingly beutiful.  I was never bored playing it.  It will be amazing to see this game get finished and voice acting added(which is in the orginal Divinity).  But for an early access it does give you a good taste of the game and you can tell the finished product will be great.

Bie,363,2,0,"September 29, 2017",Recommended,37.3,"I'm a simple man, I see my favourite Belgian games developer and I upvote... No really, this game is great.  This game feels and plays like the more classic RPG's of the past. Just look at games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights and Larians own Divine Divinity and you'll know what I'm on about. The first Original Sin was good, but this is something else, something more polished and fun to play.  Unlike many newer RPG's, this game doens't have that much handholding. It lets you explore the world and figure out things by yourself without much obvious spoonfeeding. Also, your actions have some weight on how things play out. Don't save a seemingly unimportant NPC early on and it might come back to bite you later on.  The world itself is quite interactable. Not only are there loads of things lying around for you to rummage through and steal. There are also plenty of environmental effects like puddles of water or blood giving you the chance of electrifiying it and anyone standing in it. Oil can be lit aflame, as does poison. You can let it rain to douse the flames, creating steam. Obviously your characters will also get wet because of the rain. A campfire will then again warm up your characters. All these effects are certainly fun to mix up and don't feel that gimmicky like in the first Original Sin.  Lastly and quite importantly: the inhabitants of the world feel quite alive, the story unfolds nicely, the dialogue is top notch and your party members are delightfully in depth.  Highly recommended for any RPG lover. Otherwise still a rock solid game."

I love the new class skills, the new races, and simplified crafting system. The game is appropriately difficult, and you will most likely have to do some battles more then once to figure it out. So save often. Build craft is so much fun in the game, and the replay value is very clear from the start. I keep wanting to make new characters just to try things differently. I love Love LOVE playing a Rouge. Teleporting, sneaking, stealing and back-stabbing. It's just the best.   The multiplayer in this game is a lot of fun too. I play with my husband for hours on our days off. We yell at eachother from other rooms to try and figure out a strategy, or when one of use screws up and kills the other. I feel like you wanna play this with someone you really like though, because the first time they accidentally stun you, and ruin your big attack you've been setting up, you'll wanna kill them. I am very glad this game is Co-op though. We need more games like this in the world.   So, get this game. You already want to, or else you wouldn't be here. Just do it. You won't regret it, and if you do, then there is something wrong with you. This game is amazing."

Captain K'nuckles,449,2,0,"September 2, 2017",Recommended,68.6,"Every once in a while, I get this unscratchable itch to play an RPG that allows for the freedom to not only get lost in the world and lore set before me, but to also interact and complete quests in a very open ended manner, create really unique characters with their own unique stories and ideals, and even have an actual sense of tabletop-esq role play while playing both solo and multiplayer. I've always wanted to be able to (for example) choose between either fighting a group of guards, stealth and skullduggery to sneak my way in, cause a major distraction and simply walk in, or whatever else possibility is necessary to achieve my goals of breaking into the captian's office to obtain incriminating documents.  Then along comes Divinity: Original Sin 2. A massive step up from D:OS1, (An already legendary CRPG) in just about every single major category. This EA is a very old build of what the final game will be if you've been keeping up with the Larian Dev Vids on YouTube and it still doesn't fail to astound me and scratch that itch.

Snardbuckett,227,2,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,626.6,"At first i was quite apprehensive, i played the game at a friends house in beta and i did not like the direction the game was going at first. The original armor system was akin to mass effect 2 and it felt very rock paper scissors like .... Thanksfully shy of release they made a drastic change in how armor works and he new system is quite refreshing and i like it.  the addition of a band of characters who are not blank slates while still being customizable for how you mechnically want to play the game was freaking brilliant. I love specifically Fane and Lfan the most but all of the characters are this fantastic dichotomy of being terrible people yet relatable people that seem like thier actions are primarily tainted by being on the wrong side of a ""very bad day"".  i think they did  aslightly better job of making it somewhat apparent where and what you needed to do from the get go and the ""tutorial"" section on the ship is great, playing throught the turtorial is drastically better than a pile of exposition to tell you how to play an RPG from the ground up.  Im not 100% sold on the new skill system as better, but it certainly is fluid and doent punish you as harshly for side speccing, i also like that crafting does not require skill investment and that the ""Civil"" skills have been split off so you dont have to try to choose between skewering harder or not sounding like a neanderthal in conversation.  I do however wish crafting seemed more impactful at low levels .... custom crafting your weapons and getting ahead of the curve through exploration theft and smart trading was quite fun in OS1. i find that somewhat removed in OS2 and most crafting early game is primarily for ""consumables"" and the customization of old on your own crafted weapons seems somewhat limited (using essences to add a damage type)  the introduction of more playable character races is a welcome change and the tag system really amps up the replayability to 11. I definitely agree with the sentiment its one of the best game sof the year quite possibly the best yet."

I haven't played the first one or seen any videos about it.  My plan was to complete this game over a longer period of time, and just progress on it slowly - That's impossible. This game is the reason that I have been behind on my challenge, I just couldn't slip it, and the game is HUGE, and everything is so interesting and polished.   The amount of work and passion that is behind this title is insane. Larian Studios did an amazing job. It's one of the best games I've ever played in this genre.   Already when you open the game, and start exploring the character creator, you are drawn into the premade characters stories. It's so hard to choose who you want to travel with on your adventure.  I guess I have to complete it again. haha.   I'm blown away over how polished everything was, especially all the characters you meet - You really feel a connection with everyone. I still feel bad over killing some of them.   If it ain't too obvious, I recommend this game! The game deserves every positive review - and there is a lot! :D"
Der Finger Gabriels,270,2,0,"August 16, 2017",Recommended,195.5,"I read a lot of people complaining about the elemental surfaces and I must say; it's kinda true, but only at the beginning when you don't have magic armor. I like but also hate the idea of these armors. As long as you have physical/magical armor you can't be cc'd or burned etc. same goes for the enemy. So when you fight against alot of enemies you can't cc a single one of them until their armor is gone and they overrun you(they can be slowed though).  So you have to plan your engagement more and better, and I think that's a really good thing in a tactical rpg. If you still lose the battle you can almost always find something else do to or find a better way to do it.  There are secrets everywhere and you can solve quests in multiple ways.  The companions are interesting as well and you can choose their starting class.  Playable undeads, unique co-op mechanics, crafting and there is so much more!  FULL VOICE ACTING and an extremely epic soundtrack for instance! I don't think 10/10 would be enough to rate this game. It deserves FAR more."

Yes the ending is terrible (I literally got an ending scene that i did not pick, yes several plot lines were not finished, yes there are more secret levers in act 4 than believable, yes the last fight is one which it's a totally valid not doing it and just watching the youtube.  That said, i recommend.

Agfct,404,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,117.5,"The Divinity Original Sin games are some of those hidden gems of gaming that you may have never heard of, but they just amaze you ones you start to play them.   Divinity Original sin 2 is like its predecessor focused on strategic gameplay, turn-based combat, and clever conversations. If you loved Divinity Original Sin 1 (or EE) you will love this one, and if you love old school strategic turn-based gameplay with focus on conversations (E.g. actually reading the quest description) then this game is for you.  In addition to being a completely new game, Divinity Original Sin 2 introduces new races like undead, new spells, magic armor (absorbs CC effects) and more.  Pros: -	Deep questlines with choices. -	Lots of different spells, talents, and abilities, that you choose almost freely. -	Turn based tactical combat that forces you to think. -	Voice acting on all conversations.  Cons: -	Can be brutally hard if you make the wrong choices (E.g. wrong set of spells, companions, or kills the wrong person).  Would rate it 9/10. The game has everything, but can be quite a challenge if you make a lot of wrong choices.   My Experience: Personally i have restarted my journey one time, as the first time i played i had to figure out what spells, companions and combinations of melee, ranged, magic i wanted. This game is not plug and play, and i would say it is more difficult in classic mode (normal) from the beginning then Divinity Orginal Sin EE Classic mode. You are very early on forced to look for scraps, craft gear and prepare yourself as mutch as possible in order to progress through combat. Combat is even more brutal this time around as the new magic and physical armor will prevent you from CC your enemies until it is destroyed.   The game rewards you for hard work, but you will have to work hard from very early on. Good Luck!  "
Noobsauce,83,2,0,February 18,Recommended,335.0,"Pros:  Amazing roleplaying/DnD feel. Interesting characters, witty writing, and I haven't played a game that left you this many choices since Fallout New Vegas (almost anyone can be killed at any time). Highly recommend playing one of the ""Origin"" players, or if not, at least having them as your party members, a lot of the great story telling revolves around them.  Combat system is fun and allows for a lot of theory crafting/playstyles, to the point where even people who dont' care about the RP aspect of it at all still enjoy this game. Few gripes with certain aspets but overall it feels interesting/diverse. Fights are HARD, even on normal difficulty, but far from unbeatable.   This game handles multiplayer in what is essentially a single player world better than any other game I've ever seen. The game is coded like an MMO, so you and your friends can travel hafl way across the world in a random pub and your friend can still play their game. Seemlessly allows you to hop in and out of someone's game too.  Cons:  Some weird quirks with combat that could be improved (fighting with characters while others are in dialogue, main attributes feeling uninterseting), but really this is just a tiny complaint.  In the mid part of the game it's easy to lose focus, it's so open world that you can get bogged with side quests and forget what you were supposed to be doing in the first place.  Crafting system/Inventory system feels a little meh. Crafting can honestly be 100% ignored so this  doesn't detract from the game too much, but organizing /sorting through your inventory can feel tedious at times."

Allanon,58,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,305.7,"I spent 99% of the time dicking around exploring the map.  In many other games I wouldn't have had a great time doing that because the map would end or there wouldn't be anything particularly interesting to find.  In say, Skyrim, there would probably be a cave with generic enemies to kill and that would be all.  In this game though, there was always something utterly magical to find.  I helped a rat and a turtle living in a cellar find love.  I talked to and killed evil scarecrows and helped a succubus escape a twisted hellscape with her lover.  I broke into the cellar of a kindly old woman who offered me a loan after her cat told me there were suspicious types down there and found debt collectors who turned into demons when approached.  Yet the most magical thing of all is how natural and meaningful it felt.  As a I naturally progressed through the game's story, I ran into so many bits that rewarded this idle and almost obsessive exploration.  Indeed, the story is so wonderfully open ended at times giving such simple yet broad goals that the only correct thing you can do at times is explore and lose yourself in this magical world that Larian has made.    Despite the broad nature of most of your goals the story still manages to remain present and intelligent.  Oftentimes it will surprise you by popping up at the most unexpected moments with new twists and turns in the most natural of fashions leading up to a conclusion that is both epic and satisfying.  At the beginning, your goal is simple: escape Fort Joy.  The game gives you little to no guidance on how you might do that yet you'll never feel at a lost since you'll discover so many possible ways to escape just by naturally exploring your environment.    This is easily the best game I have ever played.  There is so much magic, so much attention to detail, and a utterly brilliant and punishing battle system to boot.  It will be a long, long time before a game ever comes close to how good this game is."

U'd better watch videos about this game, then u'll find it much different from that u imagined before. When out of fights, u'll control your team like in the game Dungeon Siege, only when fighting the enemy will u control your team in a turn-based way. Also, I really enjoyed the beautiful views a lot, u'll know what I mean when u truly play the game. This game is fantastic for me. Looking forward to play all chapters of it. But there are also some bad things to tell u. There r no marks on the map which show u where u can finish your mission. And u cant see the characters from about 2 screen's distence. That means u have to go to every corner and use your mouse to see NPCs' names. This will truly take players a lot of time unless they remember where the NPC is on receiving the mission. This game is very expensive, I know that, but it's worth buying for those who r interested in turn-based games. I really don't want to see red comments like"" why is this game turn-based? I spent fu*** over 40 dollars for this rubbish?"" That's your problem! Why don't u look at the introduction before buying it? I love this game, but also hope that after this beta, they'll add some more languages. we all hope to enjoy the game in a much easier way. Many Chinese players bought this game.

So few RPGs of any type really manage to make it feel like what skill or spell you're using really matters. In D:OS2 even weak skills and spells can find their place in combat if they can create an advantage. Even the weakest fire spell can turn the tides if the enemy is standing in oil.  Let me share some fun moments with the AI.  I thought I could bamboozle the enemy by giving my main character the Zombie trait. This trait allows them to heal when poisoned but take damage from healing spells/skills/potions. I foolishly assumed that they wouldn't be able to take advantage of that but if anything it made my life harder. So many AI enemies have a basic ranged healing spell/skill, some of which will restore health over several turns. They were all too happy to use them on my character.  At some other point, I was flirting with a woman who was part of a band of thugs. We got along well and promised to meet up in the future. Shortly after that I‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•off her boss by insisting that he free my elven kin. In the ensuing battle the woman I had wooed fought against her compatriots in order to help me. She burned alive in the fray and I vowed to take her diary with me for the rest of my days.  In another encounter I was well positioned to stave off the enemy with my tank. The enemy mage saw this and cast a spell on him that swapped his position with a caged demon. I had to spend precious turns bashing the cage door open to escape while my squishy mages scattered.  The game is packed with these kinds of fun moments and turns and those were all within the first couple hours of play. Larian took what already worked in D:OS, improved it, and then fixed a lot of what didn't work. I have no idea how the co-op is but I imagine it will be excellent."

My biggest Con:  - Substantial UI Changes from Divinity: Original Sin that may take some time to get used to. It doesn't always feel like the most natural or intuitive system.  My biggest Pro:  + The storytelling between different characters/companions is always unique. Dialogue options make a difference in how they interact with you, and how the entire game unfolds.   I also love the new classes and spells they've added since Original Sin I.  This game has come a long way from when I first purchased it in Early Access. Back then it already felt like a full game and a fascinating environment that I would be happy to spend hours in, and yet the development team continues to update and polish their game. It just keeps getting better, and more fleshed out as they reach their release date.

Co-op works flawlessly and it is great to jump in and out of your friend's games.  The main campaign has plenty of content and this is one of those rare games where I feel it is worth the full price tag.    If you are on the fence about this game, I'd say 100% purchase it.

One thing that tends to bug me about these games is the inventory systems with 3,000 different items that all do the same thing, this game suffers from that a bit, but there is a decent sorting UI as well as quick filters to get to what you want.

Uglzorp,"3,153",2,0,February 11,Recommended,203.1,"Top-notch sequel that improves upon the first game in every way. The game is still incredibly open-ended and allows for all sorts of emergent gameplay. The writing is better, with more developed companions and a more layered story. Combat is deeper, with the addition of physical and magic armor that prevent you from immediately CCing enemies at the start of a fight. Now you have to carefully choose who to focus down first while considering your own defenses. On Tactician difficulty, the AI is good at picking targets and countering your moves so you definitely need to think two steps ahead. Elevation is a significant factor in combat as well, with ranged attack damage, range and line of sight being affected. There's also a much wider variety of enemies and spells/abilities, along with an expanded crafting system. Finally, the game is huge. It's about twice as big as the first game and there's no filler. Every quest, combat encounter and dungeon is carefully crafted and rewarding to play.   The only flaw is the UI. Managing your inventory is pretty cumbersome. Part of the problem is that the game is technically playable with a single character and each character in the party is treated as a solo player, so there's no shared inventory. When you're trading with a merchant, you can only access one character's inventory at a time, making it difficult to compare item stats. Trading prices are also affected by character-specific traits, so you'll need to first move the items you want to sell to the character who will get the best prices. Also, the game doesn't do a good job of explaining the many status effects. Some are self-explanatory, like Bleeding or Burning. Others, like Suffocating or Deaf, are not. Basically, the only way to learn what these do is to apply them or have them applied in combat. Larian should learn from Obsidian here and provide tooltip explanations anywhere you see status effects mentioned.  Overall, a fantastic game that would be even better with a few UI improvements."

Of all the RPG's I've played (Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, Witcher, KOTOR, Mass Effect, etc) this is the only game I can say has true and absolute freedom. The diversity and posibilities are endless making replayabilty not only valid but also incredibly unique and fun. The characters are fantastic and I am taken aback at how differently NPC's reacts to each one of your companions and your own created character depending on traits and race. With beautiful graphics, engaging lore, fantastic devs, a perfected co-op, and the ever-interesting world of Rivellon to explore I hope to see this game live on as legendary new standard for role playing games.

You have to follow the quest by yourself, with no obvious quest markers or whatsoever. You need to click every NPC here and there to proceed and the NPCs give you other quests along the way, you end up with more quests in your hand, which is awesome. It doesn't feel forced like some games do, the quests comes naturally to you and there are plenty of ways to do them, or not to. It's like playing one of those table-top RPGs. Speaking of TRPGs, if you have friends to play with, I believe it would be a much better experience.  Personally I have one and only problem though.

pinkpinnn,248,2,0,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,122.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 - 2017 GEM.  Finding a game that mixes RPG, D&D, customizable class/ characters, good story telling, beautiful aesthetics, crafting system, tactical turn based battle, and option to play co-op? This game pretty much offers it all up on a silver plate.  I've played the first Divinity Original Sin, and my impression of that wasn't so strong, however I decided to give this a try, and it definitely floored me.  None too many games I've played have done a swell job in buffing lores, stories, and open ended quests for you to explore. You don't have to be a lore-lover or a rouge type gamer to enjoy this. There's a sweet spot for everyone. I went looking for a plain old adventure-with-consequences game, and spent more time reading up short lores here and there instead of speeding through it.  I can't believe I've spent 80+ hours (solo play) and still haven't completed it yet. Actually for the first chapter, I managed to spend 8-9 hours (and this was just purely exploring and figuring out quests). Halfway through the game, it even conjured up my nostalgia for Dragon Age 1.   CONS/ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  -Sometimes there are NO warnings before huge consequences take place. And when it happens, it's too late to alter (unless you are bothered to load up a game save 1 hour ago+). This happened a few times for me, the most painful one for me being: I couldn't take my companions to the next chapter because I'd missed that one window to convince them. They were absolutely gone. I loaded a previous save, but ever since that happened, I ended up tracking quests on wikia instead in fear of a major slip up -Quest journals are sometimes vague, and you will be left wondering or wiki-ing what the next step should be -Some quests feel un-finished or un-polished, as there may only be ONE, OBSCURE way of completing it -Not a must, but nice to have: Camera angle needs more rotation flexibility -No option to hide the HUD  PROS:  -The battle system constantly makes you look for the best spots to prepare and engage. Whenever you think you've got your ""go-to"" strategies nailed down, the game manages to switch it up just a little to make it challenging (+fun) again -Attention to detail towards the environment and the overall atmosphere. I don't always stop and look at the shadows of leaves and trees in a game. Each chapter is a map with it's own characteristics -Memorable background sound and music <3 Well done Borislav Slavov  -EVERY character has a voice! And voice acting is just ace -Main companions have decent back stories, although 1 or 2 still seem like pompous ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s after 20 hours -HIGH replayability value -Co-op offers extra fun if you want play with you rmates, and most things work smoothly. Just take note of the connectivity menu, and make sure to set your game privacy, as random people can enter your game and hijack your acharacter completely. -Dungeon master mode! For those who are into D&D this might be an interesting mode to check out  TO THINK THIS GAME WAS BACKED BY A KICK STARTER AND DEVELOPED + LAUNCHED UNDER 3 YEARS!  It's not easy balancing and taking in multiple opinions and ideas and delivering on something this decent. I suspect good team work somewhere in Larian Studios. The game is decent enough for me to overlook the annoying flaws (for now). And major game developing companies? You guys better brush up your A game. Top notch graphics aren't the only thing that makes a game immersive and great.  ANYWAYS...JUST...Just ..go play it!"
Avascar,117,2,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,209.2,"What's makes an RPG? This game exceeds almost all of my expecations, and wipes away all of my fears. Engrossing writing, lovable characters, engaging combat, challenging choices, great soundtrack, and CO-OP. It's hard for me to not love this game in every aspect. And surely, it's a game that's difficult to top. Do note I will mostly talk about the main campaign, because it's what I put the most hours into.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a video game designed to look into your very soul, and asks a very direct question, 'Who are you?'. You can make a custom character, or one of the six origin characters (with specific dialogue, unique quests, and a generally different experience), and take part in an adventure alone, with NPC companions (with their own personality and relationship with you), or actual players. It goes back to the roots of RPG's, and gives you ultimate freedom to do and be whoever you want to be. To be whatever or whoever you want. And your choices matter, for every kill and every choice changes the world in some way. The world is real. You're in an adventure.  From the voice acted merchants, to the bustling cities and towns, you'll manage to find every nook and cranny as this game is filled with secrets only meant for the die-hard explorers. Different dialogue choices, hidden quests, OP loot, completely different outcomes; the world reacts to how you behave and what you know. Whether you decide to become the traditionalist hero, to the megalomaniac villian. The choice is ultimately up to you, and the game respects that. No choice nor fight is as black and white as they seem, as everyone in the story is both good and bad in their own rights (probably with the exception of the source king). It's a game you can't really have a ""perfect run"" on, choices will grant many different and branching choices based on what you do.  It goes back to the roots of RPGs from the days of Dungeons & Dragons, takes the modernism of current RPGs, and dosed with the whimsical love from Larian into a game that twists you as a whole, showing your true colors. In Co-op, it tests your relationships with your friends, as you must know only one out of the four adventurers can be Divine. It's a game that's both cooperative and yet slightly competitive, and it adds great storytelling to the entire experience.  Not only does the game contain loads of different dialogue, secrets, choices, and outcomes, it has some of the most revolutionary turn-based combat I've seen. Environmental effects from fire, rain, poison, and water. You can spend hours strategizing with your friends setting up the battlefields, as almost every enemy have their own weaknesses and strengths you must overcome. Each fight is interesting to their core, making you adapt to each situation in geography, location, environment, skills, and enemy types.  I only recently completed this game, and I realize it's one of those few games I'll have really fond moments of. It's a game where as soon as you beat it, you'll immediately start another run. I wouldn't mind paying for expansions, because the level of quality that Larian provides is amazingly superb. I don't want to give many spoilers to the game, it is full of many surprises that you must experience yourself. It's unforgettable, I tell you!  Of course, this game isn't perfect. Bugs are rather prevalent, as you literally can't get some achievements. Aside from bugs, I do wish there was more character development between my companions. This isn't an issue when all of your characters are actual people. But when they're NPC companions they don't talk very often, only during specific and important story scenes. If you play solo, there will be times when you don't notice their presence because they never have any dialogue to say, which is a shame in my opinion. I won't dabble on it much, but Act 4 is a bit lame as there isn't as much depth to it compared to Act 1 and 2. This entry of the series also messes up the timeline of the games, which puzzles many previous players like me. And the final boss isn't as magnificant as I wanted it to be (no multiple boss phases!?!).  There's also the Arena mode, which is an online PvP game mode. It's pretty dead, and it seems to be the most rushed out of the 3 (Campaign, Arena, and Game Master). You can only select a few presets of characters (no character nor skill customization), and in my experience I had trouble finding a match to play. I wouldn't play this for the Arena mode because it's pretty awful. The idea is great, but the execution just isn't there.  I also haven't managed to play much of the Game Master mode. A game mode that's quite literally Dungeons and Dragons. There's a rather small following for it, and there are custom campaigns out you can play right now. And from the looks of it, seems very fun. The combat is very streamlined, and the numbers are very easy to manage. I find it better than the use of spreadsheets, very long text documents, or literally piles of papers in my experience. But ultimately, it's personal preference.  But aside from that, everything about this game is fantastic. OST (Main theme, Rivellon, all the character theme songs), aesthetics (perhaps the humans and dwarves are a bit ugly looking), storytelling, dialogue, choices, secrets, combat, mod support, and so much more. Don't think my critiques give you the impression that they ruin the entire experience, because they don't. In the end, you'll feel like you finished an adventure. You mold the game, and yet the game molds you. The world of Rivellon reacts to your moves, with its inner gears shifting and moving. You will tell countless stories of it, I assure you.  So, what makes an RPG? The storytelling experience. And a storytelling experience that allows you to be in the eyes of a child, becoming whoever or whatever you want and having your choices matter in a significant way is an astonishing feat all on its own.  And that, is why I would easily give this game a 10/10. Simply revolutionary."

I rate it better than my favorites Baldurs Gate and Baldurs Gate 2. While I don't give this better marks than Witcher 3 (I mean... seriously I don't see how you could), this title is supremely worthy of purchase to anyone who calls themselves an RPG fan.  I could go on and on about how interesting the character building is in this game, but its probably one of the more frustrating aspects of the title. Their are so many choices, its difficult to fit all of them in, in a single play through. While I do consider their to be some balancing issues between physical/melee and ranged/magic, I do imagine that player mods will one day solve this.  If players committed to making engrossing campaigns (or the developers continued to add-on to this title) I'd be set in my deeply-rooted RPG needs for years to come.  Kudos to them for actually coming up with a storyline that interested me, and wasn't filled with standard fantasy tropes. I really enjoyed this, despite not having completed it yet.

It is so rich and detailed and I would recommend this as Game of the Year, as you are getting a campaign, single player or co-op and arena mode as well as the gamemaster mode, which is Dungeons and Dragons, for $45. Easily over 250 hours of gameplay, and it just keeps getting better. Every triple A developer should take note- this is what the industry needs. I haven't been so enticed and enchanted by a video game in many, many, many years. I can say, after much consideration and time spent thinking about this game, it is my favorite game of all-time.

Gergg,663,2,0,"September 8, 2017",Recommended,72.3,"An incredible game that promises to be even more amazing when it launches next week.  The combat really stands head-and-shoulders above other classic RPGs like Tyranny and Pillars of Eternity. So few RPGs of any type really manage to make it feel like what skill or spell you're using really matters. In D:OS2 even weak skills and spells can find their place in combat if they can create an advantage. Even the weakest fire spell can turn the tides if the enemy is standing in oil.  Let me share some fun moments with the AI.  I thought I could bamboozle the enemy by giving my main character the Zombie trait. This trait allows them to heal when poisoned but take damage from healing spells/skills/potions. I foolishly assumed that they wouldn't be able to take advantage of that but if anything it made my life harder. So many AI enemies have a basic ranged healing spell/skill, some of which will restore health over several turns. They were all too happy to use them on my character.  At some other point, I was flirting with a woman who was part of a band of thugs. We got along well and promised to meet up in the future. Shortly after that I‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•off her boss by insisting that he free my elven kin. In the ensuing battle the woman I had wooed fought against her compatriots in order to help me. She burned alive in the fray and I vowed to take her diary with me for the rest of my days.  In another encounter I was well positioned to stave off the enemy with my tank. The enemy mage saw this and cast a spell on him that swapped his position with a caged demon. I had to spend precious turns bashing the cage door open to escape while my squishy mages scattered.  The game is packed with these kinds of fun moments and turns and those were all within the first couple hours of play. Larian took what already worked in D:OS, improved it, and then fixed a lot of what didn't work. I have no idea how the co-op is but I imagine it will be excellent."

Larian studio's really out did themselves with this game, if I had completed every single possible side quest/content before the main story finishes we are looking into 150hours plus (on honour mode which I play) or 100 hours plus on any other difficulty whilst reading dialogue etc.. This game is best played with friends as the character interactions/dialogue is top notch and provide really fun role playing. However I played by myself as I wanted to get immersed and finish the game on the hardest difficulty due feelings of it being rushed if I played with more people.   it took me 52 hours to complete the game doing story mission only with 1 origin character story (Lohse completed) as well as critical side quests that are blocking my way to the main quest. I'm also playing on Honour Mode difficulty(if your whole party dies you save is wiped), basically I have to play very safe ( I died quarter way in the game, salty af).   This game is worth every penny and its price tag just beats some of AAA games on global top sellers on steam for content/replayability to price ratio.  I'm hoping for a Divinity: Original Sin 3 :DDDD, I loved the story in this :DDDD  Edited : I'm gonna head back into this game and finish all side quests as well as explore."

The first 40-50 hours are some of the best RPG experiences I've had since BGII Amn.  Somewhere around the middle of the game the numbers start getting whacky and the battles actually become quite easy and exploitable, so it becomes an exercise of self-restraint not to cheese your way to the end.  I look forward to mods and rebalancing to make this title stand as one of the best RPGs ever made."

Well in reality publishers do have their uses since they have deep fat pockets, but at least Larian is showing others that you don't need a business guy looking over you shoulder to make great games.

I_Rock_Fiction,23,2,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,214.9,"Student Game Designer : Focus in UI/UX (Overall) 10/10     This is Hands down the best Turn based RPG i have ever played. Numerous improvements have been made since the last game (Divinity Original Sin). The Textures and animations are amazing. Also There seems to be a much more deep combo system compared to the last game which will make for some fantastic experamentation. Combat is still very interesting with most encounters resulting in different choices by the Enemy AI which ""spices"" up engagments.   Pros   The Characters and Dialoge are of course very good, with all of the origin characters having interesting backgrounds. your choices are questioned by your party memebers and many of them have different veiws, as they should.  The Skills and combos are fantastic and really fun to use although you will need to remember that your combos can be exploited or even used agaisnt you by the enemy Ai.  Armor and weapons look great and there seems to be a wide variety of different skins for each type of weapon.  While i did not explore the crafting system as much as i should have its pretty much the same as the last game. Although there are supposed to be way more (items etc) that we can craft.  The sound affects and the soundtrack are just as catchy and cool as last time. (GIVE ME THE SOUNDTRACK)  Cons.   Some enemy types have almost unfair adavantages against a party of any compsition, namley the undead and or necromancers/witches. Undead/ dark magic users, can both heal from poison and blood, as well as regular healing spells, which really just makes the battle alot longer than it needs to be. Ive never been a fan of undead being able to use the Hydro Healing spells. They should benfit from blood/poison fields/ spells only.  The Ui Still needs a bit of improvement as the item management system is still not that great. But is ok. It is very simplistic/minimalistic which is fine but we will need access to a universal chest of some sort to store our materials and such in. Or multiple backpacks will need to be equipped to carry most of your loot /items. Rather than turning one character into a pack mule or having lots of items spread out around multiple characters.      "

Ridiculous Primate,17,2,0,"October 30, 2017",Recommended,276.4,"This game is one of my favorites of all time now. The world is immersive and beautiful.  The battles are challenging yet rewarding.  I played through it on Tactician mode  out of the gate because I beat the first game on Tactician mode and figured I'd master this in no time too.  The difficulty was surprising at times.  But one thing that I really liked about the difficulty was that it didn't rely on RNG for everything.  There are a few RNG elements, but for the most part the fights are designed to be beaten by strategy and predicting what the enemies would do. The over arching story was pretty classic, but what made me really love it was the companion stories.  They were really interesting and I really loved them.  Some people on here have commented that the companions don't interact much, and while I would have loved for them to interact more than they did, I feel like their stories cross over a lot.  For example Sebille and the Red Prince's stories straight up merge near the end if you are playing with them both in the party. I would suggest taking Lohse in your party too, because her personal quest is one of the best. I know there are still some bugs, and those can be frustrating. I know it uses some classic tropes, but classic tropes are classic for a reason.  Sometimes when you try  to reinvent the wheel you end up making a block of rock. The game also does successfully reinvent the wheel at a few points. I played it all through tactician mode and felt it was a good difficulty considering I took the hardest option.  If you are playing a game on the hardest setting you should expect to have to fight some fights multiple times to master them, and it makes me so happy that I never felt like I was just flipping a coin to win a fight.  Every decision in fights matters a lot. It's not a perfect game, but no game has ever been perfect.  This game is pretty damn good though, and if they fixed the broken quests and bugs I would put it in my top 5 RPGs instantly.  My major complaint about this game is that there isn't more of it.  I can't wait for some DLC."

I don't know what it is about this version that makes it feel so much better. I played Divinity: Original Sin 1. I enjoyed it to some extent. Felt it was a bit slow and never did make it through the whole thing. Original Sin 2 hit me in a completely different way.  The story is incredible, the characters feel lifelike, and there's amazing attention to detail. I actually feel invested in everything I do.  Thank you for this game."
Avascar,117,2,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,209.2,"What's makes an RPG? This game exceeds almost all of my expecations, and wipes away all of my fears. Engrossing writing, lovable characters, engaging combat, challenging choices, great soundtrack, and CO-OP. It's hard for me to not love this game in every aspect. And surely, it's a game that's difficult to top. Do note I will mostly talk about the main campaign, because it's what I put the most hours into.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a video game designed to look into your very soul, and asks a very direct question, 'Who are you?'. You can make a custom character, or one of the six origin characters (with specific dialogue, unique quests, and a generally different experience), and take part in an adventure alone, with NPC companions (with their own personality and relationship with you), or actual players. It goes back to the roots of RPG's, and gives you ultimate freedom to do and be whoever you want to be. To be whatever or whoever you want. And your choices matter, for every kill and every choice changes the world in some way. The world is real. You're in an adventure.  From the voice acted merchants, to the bustling cities and towns, you'll manage to find every nook and cranny as this game is filled with secrets only meant for the die-hard explorers. Different dialogue choices, hidden quests, OP loot, completely different outcomes; the world reacts to how you behave and what you know. Whether you decide to become the traditionalist hero, to the megalomaniac villian. The choice is ultimately up to you, and the game respects that. No choice nor fight is as black and white as they seem, as everyone in the story is both good and bad in their own rights (probably with the exception of the source king). It's a game you can't really have a ""perfect run"" on, choices will grant many different and branching choices based on what you do.  It goes back to the roots of RPGs from the days of Dungeons & Dragons, takes the modernism of current RPGs, and dosed with the whimsical love from Larian into a game that twists you as a whole, showing your true colors. In Co-op, it tests your relationships with your friends, as you must know only one out of the four adventurers can be Divine. It's a game that's both cooperative and yet slightly competitive, and it adds great storytelling to the entire experience.  Not only does the game contain loads of different dialogue, secrets, choices, and outcomes, it has some of the most revolutionary turn-based combat I've seen. Environmental effects from fire, rain, poison, and water. You can spend hours strategizing with your friends setting up the battlefields, as almost every enemy have their own weaknesses and strengths you must overcome. Each fight is interesting to their core, making you adapt to each situation in geography, location, environment, skills, and enemy types.  I only recently completed this game, and I realize it's one of those few games I'll have really fond moments of. It's a game where as soon as you beat it, you'll immediately start another run. I wouldn't mind paying for expansions, because the level of quality that Larian provides is amazingly superb. I don't want to give many spoilers to the game, it is full of many surprises that you must experience yourself. It's unforgettable, I tell you!  Of course, this game isn't perfect. Bugs are rather prevalent, as you literally can't get some achievements. Aside from bugs, I do wish there was more character development between my companions. This isn't an issue when all of your characters are actual people. But when they're NPC companions they don't talk very often, only during specific and important story scenes. If you play solo, there will be times when you don't notice their presence because they never have any dialogue to say, which is a shame in my opinion. I won't dabble on it much, but Act 4 is a bit lame as there isn't as much depth to it compared to Act 1 and 2. This entry of the series also messes up the timeline of the games, which puzzles many previous players like me. And the final boss isn't as magnificant as I wanted it to be (no multiple boss phases!?!).  There's also the Arena mode, which is an online PvP game mode. It's pretty dead, and it seems to be the most rushed out of the 3 (Campaign, Arena, and Game Master). You can only select a few presets of characters (no character nor skill customization), and in my experience I had trouble finding a match to play. I wouldn't play this for the Arena mode because it's pretty awful. The idea is great, but the execution just isn't there.  I also haven't managed to play much of the Game Master mode. A game mode that's quite literally Dungeons and Dragons. There's a rather small following for it, and there are custom campaigns out you can play right now. And from the looks of it, seems very fun. The combat is very streamlined, and the numbers are very easy to manage. I find it better than the use of spreadsheets, very long text documents, or literally piles of papers in my experience. But ultimately, it's personal preference.  But aside from that, everything about this game is fantastic. OST (Main theme, Rivellon, all the character theme songs), aesthetics (perhaps the humans and dwarves are a bit ugly looking), storytelling, dialogue, choices, secrets, combat, mod support, and so much more. Don't think my critiques give you the impression that they ruin the entire experience, because they don't. In the end, you'll feel like you finished an adventure. You mold the game, and yet the game molds you. The world of Rivellon reacts to your moves, with its inner gears shifting and moving. You will tell countless stories of it, I assure you.  So, what makes an RPG? The storytelling experience. And a storytelling experience that allows you to be in the eyes of a child, becoming whoever or whatever you want and having your choices matter in a significant way is an astonishing feat all on its own.  And that, is why I would easily give this game a 10/10. Simply revolutionary."

Character development is personal and you really feel the pain and suffering written into the narrative. Combat is challenging and fun. A late early game element of being able to respec at any time takes away the fear of getting it wrong. All text is voiced by first class voice actors. This is the closest i have come to pen and paper gaming in years (always a GM, never a player!)  I heartily recommend this game to anyone. This is the best RPG PC gaming has to offer.   10/10 will be playing again.  Played as Lohse, final level 21 and very satisfied by my end story. Buy this game.

An elf licking your arm! Villains you just gotta hate and a story that really captivated me from the beginning until the end.

Eilik,609,2,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,132.4,"I'm just writing a very brief review, in no way am I actually giving this game justice with my words, but I feel I have to write something as this game has consumed my life for the past 4 or 5 days.  Let's get started with the fact that I have not played any of the previous Divinity games, however I am a huge fan of CRPGs, stemming from the time I originally sat down and played the Dungeons and Dragons dungeon crawler: Pool of Raidiance - Ruins of Myth Drannor. Since that time I had backtracked, played through Neverwinter 1 and 2, though never actually completing them, as well as Wasteland, the Fallout series, pretty much most of the 'mainstream' crpgs most people are familiar with.  A few days ago a friend tossed me this game as a gift, honestly I am very thankful as this game has breathed new life into my fascination to this genre.  From the get go, the game is not forgiving, if you ignore obvious signs, you will die. Even on the normal difficulties if you lack in perception, the game has no qualm about stamping your expectations in the dust. And even if you are paying attention, it still does so. The way it handles ground effects, along with most spells being aoe, and actually having an impact. So you better think twice about casting that poison spell with your undead mage because he may be low health, but you may end up be using 3 resurrection scrolls instead of just one. Or you may send the dominoes of chaos smashing together to kill literally everything on the battlefield, as well as yourself.  Difficulty doesn't spike horribly though, once you get the hang of things, it's actually a breeze if you're used to any kind of tactics, especially in classic mode. Though I give credit to the enemy AI. There are times they are smarter than their own good, geeking the mage rather than going after my tanky knight front and center.  However this is a downside as well, because if my undead is under an enchantment to appear for all intensive purposes, as an elf. How yould you know it was undead to cast that heal spell on it?  But I digress, I have 60 hours in the game, I had finally after a lot of exploration started exploring the place after the initial island, and I am loving the game even more. Again, this isn't even half of my feelings, there are obviously some negatives, but they have already been stated by someone else, or I feel they are not an issue.  I heartily reccomend, I got it as a gift, and I actually wish I had been able to buy it myself."
Nordstrus,67,2,2,"December 5, 2017",Recommended,98.0,"Finally beat my first walkthrough, and I can say with the upmost excitement I am ready to start my second. The feels and sense of pride and accomplishment you get at the end is like no other. The campaign was arguably the best 70 hours of my life and I enjoyed every second of discovery, storytelling, and loading saves. It is so rich and detailed and I would recommend this as Game of the Year, as you are getting a campaign, single player or co-op and arena mode as well as the gamemaster mode, which is Dungeons and Dragons, for $45. Easily over 250 hours of gameplay, and it just keeps getting better. Every triple A developer should take note- this is what the industry needs. I haven't been so enticed and enchanted by a video game in many, many, many years. I can say, after much consideration and time spent thinking about this game, it is my favorite game of all-time.

The Morg,112,2,1,January 21,Recommended,285.7,"I have just completed this wonderful game, and am happy to conclude that this is as many have said before, one of the best RPG's ever made, I was going to gush on about the many, many things it does so well, but other people have already done that, so I'll post some personal nuggets instead.   I wrote several lists of moments I'd experienced because I didn't want to forget them. This isn't something I do.  Some were unexpected story twists, others were dramatic events that happened as a result of the freedom the games systems give you to tell your own story. Here's one example:   I took revenge on the person who had enslaved me , by charming his bodyguards so they turned against him, I then charmed him so he fought his lackies for my pleasure. When I understood he had received the message, that he, rather than I was the slave: I poisoned him, immobilised him and finally set fire to him so I could watch him slowly die. I have never been so invested in a character's story that I'd do something like this, but this is precisely what my character would do, and it played out through gameplay..   I saved the person I had come to love from a fate worst than death, at incredible cost,  and the resulting events, caused me to clap, and play sponeaneous air guitar to the musical interlude that followed...  I'd like to share far more...but spoilers.  Final thoughts: Incredible writing aided by a narrator which, which works wonderfully, adding a whole new level to the story.  I was still finding new secrets and game play twists 250 hours in. This is a GAME. In comparison, the Witcher is a story with some light game play elements. The crafting system alone in the this game has more complexity than some entire games. The systems are rich and deep, and  allow you to tell your story without cut scenes and token choices. This game makes you care about your companions, and you can change their fates in ways too numerous to mention. You may feel misty eyed when you wave your final goodbyes to them. I did.  Puzzles. Remember Skyrim with it's samey symbol traps? This game has unique puzzles and traps that require brains, skill and reading to unvover. It treats the players as if they are intelligent. You will feel clever playing this game.  The combat is so rich, I feel I've only scratched the surface of the abilities it gives you. I can't think of any game with as many original and interesting spells and abilities.   In summary, this is an amazing accomplishment. It make look like games of yesteryear but is a quantum leap from games like Pillars of Eternity. It is incredibly innovative accross the board for it's approach to combat, player agency, and narriative story telling.   And what story telling. The game initially appears generic fantasy fair, but it's so much more. If you like RPG's at all, or have any interest in game design, I humbly suggest you give this  some time. It's hard at first and may initially  seem genric, but it's a game that blossoms as you progress, revealing itself  in beuautiful and suprising ways with every step you take.  10/10. Thanks Larrian!"

Of all the RPG's I've played (Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, Witcher, KOTOR, Mass Effect, etc) this is the only game I can say has true and absolute freedom. The diversity and posibilities are endless making replayabilty not only valid but also incredibly unique and fun. The characters are fantastic and I am taken aback at how differently NPC's reacts to each one of your companions and your own created character depending on traits and race. With beautiful graphics, engaging lore, fantastic devs, a perfected co-op, and the ever-interesting world of Rivellon to explore I hope to see this game live on as legendary new standard for role playing games.   Also my low hours count is because I played the early access not on steam"

JPŒõŒö,273,2,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,37.2,"First, let me say that this is my first Turn-based RPG ever. I did not expect this game to be as good as it is.  Right from the start, as you level up, you can feel that the levels matter and you actually need to level up if you want to proceed in the game. Same thing happens with your gear. You really need to find some better gear in order to win some battles.   The battles feel very challenging and therefore rewarding when you actually beat them. It feels good when you come up with a strategy and you win after countless of losses. (Experience may vary :D)  I like the characters. Every character seems to have a personality (even the animals!) and they seem well written. This is the first game I've played that has a narrator too! That's cool as he can really paint the picture for you because the characters don't really have good animations for every emotion or so in these top-down RPG's  Graphics look good for but I'd like a better antialiasing as MSAAx1 is not enough. Otherwise this game looks amazing. Lot's of cool places to discover and stunning vistas. The soundtrack is good too, the game lets you decide which type of music do you want to hear when you make your character. I recommend finding the soundtrack in YouTube and listening it.   I can't really think of cons because I don't have anything to complain (yet)."

It's really that great if you into RPG stuff. If you not it's the best place to start. If you have friends who would like to play it with you, it will be your GOTY, for sure.  Pros: Great graphics. One of the best fantasy soundtracks in gaming history. Great campaign with funny, intense moments, scary and entertaining moments. Great writing and overall plot. Huge replayability. Awesome tactical combats. Complex and flexible character building. The best implementation of the coop gameplay in all RPGs ever. Game Master mode for those who would like to play with their friends even after the campaign. A great mod tool that allows you do almost anything in the game. If you willing to spend some time off cause. Content in the game for 100+ hours minimum. Arena PVP mode exists.  Cons: The game still has some bugs. Though all great RPGs has and developers are working really hard fixing them. GM mode could have more love. It lacks a lot of crucial features and a lot of things that exist in the game are unavailable. Though mods in the workshop can help with fixing some of them. Arena PVP mode could have even more love. It's very primitive and it seems like developers haven't worked much on it. Hope they will improve it in the future.  Should you buy it? Definitely!"

The freedom, the charachter creation, the gameplay and the massively in-depth story. .Dont like somebody? be it good or bad, no problem you can just kill them!  If you like turn-based or classic RPG's this is the new King of the Genre.  Larian are the best most honest development studio ever (i kickstartered both their Original sin titles) if they make a mistake they let you know and keep you updated.  10/10 i will buy any larian game in a hearbeat. <------take note ubisoft/EA this is how you make a good game."
Mokona,31,2,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,22.7,"This review is just based on my first impressions of the game. Its worth getting.  There is an insane amount of skills and combos you can do that a single play through will never allow you to see all the cool stuff you can do so the replay value is high. My favorite thing I've discovered in the game is the way recruiting followers works. First you must convince them to follow you to begin with, they dont just come along because you are the ""chosen one"" or some crap. To boot if you like a character you dont have to worry about him being a mage when you are already a mage because each character asks you what you want them to be. No longer are you forced to not take your favorite npc with you or forced to play a class you dont like just to take it with you. You can finally have a balanced party full of npc you find interesting hurrah.  The only thing I would ""complain"" about is the lack of non human races. You got human, dwarf (small human), elf (vegetarian human), and lizard man (finally its not a human). Skeleton variations of all is nice to throw in but I honestly am just done with every fantacy game haveing there races be the 3 over used races, human, elf, dwarf, and then a final race being there own ""custom"" race that just turn out to be another human but blue or something like that. Glad we got lizard men but wish we had a few more.  This game has a lot of thought put into it and it somehow didn't lauch at the $60 price point, with mod support. I expected this to be as dissapointing as pillars of eternity was but just jumping into the character creation and I was already loving the game."
TheCynicalTaco,154,2,0,February 3,Recommended,237.1,"I've got to say that after 200 hours of experiencing this game and trying out different means of playing, I've encountered an experience like no other. It is obvious that the developers of this game have put in their hearts to making a game that best suits the wants of a community of tired gamers who just wanted the freedom to make decisions, to customize their gameplay, and have a fully immersive story all along the way. Not only that, but this game will introduce you to new and interesting game mechanics that are both a pleasure to play with and against. When things go wrong in the game, you can't help but laugh it off because you are fully aware that your faults lay in your own mistakes or lack of understanding about certain core mechanics. However frustrated you may get at something or upset with yourself for having made some mistake, the game is interesting and engaging enough to motivate you to try again and learn from your mistakes. This game is definitely a must buy for any rpg lover.  If there is one thing I can hope to see in the future, it is official DLC. I would love to experience new classes, new abilities, new gear, and new stories. It would be nice to have a playthrough of the ""enemy's"" side since even many of the enemies can be misunderstood or mislead. Also, a story revolving around the races that aren't present in this game could make for more gameplay and story without taking away from the existing one. Finally, more emphasis on the cooking/crafting system would be warranted. As it stands, crafting is not very important as you can find everything that is craftable and more. One of the only important recipes you need to know: Shoes + Nails = saved lives."

It is out of all the games I've purchased recently, the most rewarding for the money I spent in time and enjoyment its given me, and I'm not even finished with the game. Far from it.  If you enjoyed Fallout, Fallout 2, The Elder Scrolls series, and other deep RPG's that modern RPG's have moved away from, with all the polish and modern tech of a triple A game, definitely give Divinity 2: Original Sin a go.

I poured countless hours into the first D:OS and fell in love with the game. I was truly blown away by that game. When D:OS 2 became available as early access I immediately bought it to support Larian even though I waited til full release to play it. So far I've put 45 hours into the D:OS 2 and I'm playing on tactitian mode and I'm far from beating it but from everything I've seen so far this game further enhances and polishes the experience from the first game. I have zero complaints, this game is basically perfection. I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in the genre. It's a mechanicaly deep rpg with a great cast of characters, lore and combat. The game doesn't hold your hand and the story and quests unfold naturally. This isn't a game to rush through, you'll find the most joy out of it if you take your time and explore the world it has to offer. Years later I still think of my experience with the first D:OS, I can only imagine the long lasting impression this game will leave on me."

If you're a fan of cRPG's in any sense (think Baulder's Gate) you will absolutely love this.   The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, the graphics are great, the gameplay is where it REALLY shines. The fights are difficult, the AI is actually smart, and tactician will put your characters through a grinder when you thought you had it down.  At no point in the game did I feel like it was a slog or a chore to get through during my first playthrough, there was always something meaningful I could do. Just one more side quest before the main story, helping out this one person, talking to this one chicken. The story is also very well done, I feel as though I could actually talk to the characters if they were real people, they are fleshed out very well.   Larian is an extremely awesome company, they delayed the release of the game to add in a fully voiced game due to community request. They listen to their customers, apply the feedback properly, and keep them updated. Definitely the best game company out there right now.  The first act is a very good tutorial, the second act builds the world and the story, and act 3 and 4 take the fun of those two and multiply it by 5. I don't have enough good things to say about this game. The only negative is that it has now ruined so many others for me, because they won't be as good as this. Now I'm bored and don't know what else to start playing.   Ratings: Music: 15/10 (seriously the soundtrack is THAT good) Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Difficulty: 10/10 (has difficulties for all levels of players)  Overall it is a top 3 game that I have ever played.

Tero,108,2,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,149.5,"My party stumbles upon a hidden mound in a grave yard. None of them have a shovel so the lizard in my party (a prince) is relegated to uncover the grave with his claws. A disembodied lizard leg appears and my prince is given two options, ""Pick up"" and ""Eat."" Naturally I choose ""Eat."" A spirit appears and says ""You Savage! I hope you choke on me!"" giving my lizard prince a curse. I couldn't stop laughing...  There is a lot of humor in this game that is on purpose and a ton that is seemingly accidental. The writing is great and the stories are enthralling. I find myself wanting to complete side quests to find out what happens rather than simply squeezing that last bit of XP. Half the time I walk around after a quest is already completed just to see if there are any additional clues as to why somebody did something.  So far I am really enjoying this game.  =============== Downsides: - There are a lot of bugs. I have found a lot of situations where I have to reload the game. For example; a battle where I can't loot a corpse (the arachnid in the graveyard).  - More bugs. I discovered that the reason I couldn't target enemies in the Driftwood arena was because I wan't zoomed in enough. After I realized this I was able to beat the competition.  - Even more bugs (getting access to a waypoint early because I was on a cliff overlooking it, which allowed me to fast-travel to the waypoint and expedite my storyline). In the end it wasn't a big deal but my quest progress leap-frogged past the initial quest giver ( I met the quest giver long after I defeated the boss)."

Epicjynx,155,2,0,February 12,Recommended,65.0,"Great game, a true RPG and the closest thing to a Dungeons and Dragons video game. There is so much to do in this game, every location has secrets, every NPC can be interacted with (and is voice acted, spectacularly I might add) even animals can be talked to with a certain ability, every quest is written masterfully, and the combat is what all turn based games should strive to be.  I only have 2 complaints, the first is about performance. This game stutters a lot while not being the most graphically impressing and takes up a lot of RAM use. Load times are fairly long and sometimes the sound cuts out for up to 30 seconds.  The second is about multiplayer. It's unplayable for me, after a while it's impossible to connect to an old save, the only way to play is start a new save everytime.  Other than that the game is fantastic, just wish they fixed these issues."

Voiced narrator and characters (every RPG needs one, once you go voiced you cant go back to reading blocks of texts)  Con: Some bugs and performance issues. some sadness at the end (the kind that you get after finishing a really good book with no immediate sequels)  This is one of those games that by the time the credits roll, you want to give the devs a standing ovation.  P.S: if you want front row seats to the main story use Fane as your main character.  If you want an amazing/rich and personal story, pick Lohse. If you want a revenge/redemption tale, pick Ifan/Sebille/Beast If you want to experience a disgraced noble's rise to power pick The red prince.   "

Angelicat,98,2,1,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,197.2,"There are already a ton of reviews that say everything (both bad and good) that has to be said about the game, so let me tell you a story instead.  Dreamy Hair Coco  There once was a dwarf named Dreamy Hair Coco, who despite his name, had naught a single hair on his head. All journeys begin with a goal, and thus Dreamy Hair Coco decided that his would be to find luscious hair befitting of his scalp, and name. Alas, nothing ever goes according to what one desires, and thus begins a story like no other.  Captured as a Sourcerer during his journey, he would quickly find himself tossed into a conflict spanning ages...a devious plot decades in the making that threatened to change everything he knew. However, he was not alone. He would meet others who held the same power in them like him. They were -  Sebille, an elf ranger who read a guide before the game released so he would know the highest damage build to play as and constantly shove it in their faces.  Boner Bagins, the red lizard prince mage who is every bit as stupid as you would imagine him to be from his name.  and Gloks, the undead warrior, ""I hate your god damn guts Gloks **** you.""  Together, they would set out to save the world - as Godwokens.  Saving the world was not going to be an easy task by any means. The Voidwoken were ruthless in their assault, and all manners of evil were at their foulest. However - the hardest task Dreamy Hair Coco would come upon, was trying to rescue the world with three idiots of the highest calibur.  Arriving on land after being stuck in the tutorial ship for an hour because someone would keep attacking every single guard thinking it's funny, they would eventually make their way to Fort Joy where they would have to find a way out of the dastardly place in order to embrace their fate as Godwoken. Instead, Sebille started whining about how no one had thievery so they couldn't get any spellbooks and that the game was too hard, and Boner Bagins, the grandest of the lizard mages, would proceed to kill his companions over and over and over due to friendly fire. Gloks, seemingly innocent in all of this, would slowly start to reveal his true nature as time went on...  It was not all bad however, as Dreamy Hair Coco would eventually find a skillbook called Medusa Head, that enabled him to temporarily sprout snake-like hair. While not what he had in mind, he was at least making headway on his goal. It wasn't until he finally met his god and was told that of all the Godwokens, only one may be Divine however, that he decided that he would be the one to claim that namesake and the power that came with it, so that his ultimate wish would finally be granted.  After a gruelling battle with Alexander, they would board the Lady Vengeance and make their way to the Reaper's Coast, where they would have to learn to wield and master the power that is in them. However, things finally took a turn for the worse - Sebille's crying finally made Dreamy Hair Coco lose the last of the precious strands of hair that he had, and he would get Thievery. Things were fine for a while - everyone got their skillbooks, and even new equipment. They were strong; they could handle anything thrown at them now. However, such power has a price...and Dreamy Hair Coco, oh so noble and bald, would fall prey to what being a thief means - he would end up stealing from every single person he came across, delaying their journey and forcing reloads left and right because he would anger entire villages at once. Sebille, realizing the monster he had created in his incessant whining (and realizing how much time they were wasting each day), tried to convince Dreamy Hair Coco to see the light again. Dreamy Hair Coco, once so noble but always so bald, would hear the plea of his friend, and swore to steal no longer from that day forth.   Gloks however, had other plans. Having seen the profits Dreamy Hair Coco was making and sharing with them, decided that he would pick up Thievery without telling anyone. A journey of this magnitude is when you truly find yourself and Gloks found out what he was - a piece of **** ****ing greedy *** ************. In the meantime, during all of this, Boner Bagins learned a secret talent that only someone of his exact stature, name, and prestige could gain - He gained the ability to die in every battle no matter what and be utterly useless.  With newfound resolve, gear, greed, and skill, the four would continue on their journey and become masters of the Source, leaving behind Reaper's Coast and coasting through the rest of their journey on the Nameless Isle. Unfortunately, the bumps on a road never end, and soon, they would face a new crisis unlike any other...  Boner Bagins, having practically no use in any of the fights for a long time now, and ensuring that every fight that started was with him on the enemies' side, was getting angry at Sebille's constant bragging. Wanting to share in the spotlight as Gloks, who was stealing equipment and exploiting the gold-bag trick (and denying it as a real thief would), was also starting to contribute his fair share during a fight while Dreamy Hair Coco was dreamy and thus always useful - Boner Bagins would decide that the arcane arts were no longer for him and that he was destined to be a rogue instead.  Hearing the winds chattering his name and the cries of his daggers thirsting for the blood of his enemies, he would fully embrace his new-found role as if it was his very birthright to begin with, never losing a beat as he transitioned from bright burning fires to the darkness of the shadows. With agility like a fox and reflexes like a mongoose, he was made for this.  Sadly, he still died constantly and stayed useless for the rest of the story.  TOO MUCH SPOILER SO I HAVE TO SKIP  Finally arriving at Arx, and ultimately the final battle, all that they had learned about themselves and each other would be put to the test here...but as if guided by the hand of fate, Dreamy Hair Coco would find himself the last one standing just as when they were so close to bringing it all to a closure. With his last ounce of strength, Dreamy Hair Coco unleashed everything he had, and...he did it, it was all over. As his companions lay lifeless around him, there was only one person who could ascend and become Divine - him. As he sat down on the throne; His throne, and made his wish, he realized that getting to grow hair wasn't an option as a Divine and he had to pick one of three boring options instead. ""Sigh"", he thought to himself, ""Guess I better get a wig"".  As he braced for the conclusion of it all, to see what his choice had yielded for the world he had fought so hard for, he realized his companions weren't actually lifeless and were talking among themselves. ""Hey, why can't I see the god damn cutscene?"" said one of them. ""WTF IS THIS BUGGY‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•GAME I CAN'T DO ANYTHING"" said another. Realizing that he was Divine now however, he ignored them and went on to view the world that would come to pass under his rule.  It was in this instance however, that he would finally realize all along that there was already a true Divine. One who held power over everything, yet seemingly always weak and frail. It was none other than Boner Bagins, who controlled the save game file. He would shut the server down and log off instantly, having finally gotten tired of it all. None of them would ever get a chance to see what happened in the end.  As for Dreamy Hair Coco...well, some say that he finally realized the existence of the Face Ripper and could have just made hair that way, or that he embraced his Medusa Head look. Whatever the case is...Larian please fix that god damn cut scene at the end cutting out halfway if someone shuts down the server god damn it I don't want to play through the game again to see what the hell happens at the end. Thanks."

In this game you will spend A LOTS of hours playing, trying, retrying, reading, discovering, stealing, hating some npcs, you will find some very nice plots.  The gameplay is really fluid, even for those whom dont like turned based games, you adapt with the system of fight in a time of an eye blink.   I need to say, GET THIS GAME, mainly if you are tha kind of player who likes the lore, believe me, this game have and awesome lore rich in details, i really wish they made another Divinty, surelly me and my friends would pre-buy.  GET THIS GAME NOW!!! WILL YOU BECOME A DIVINE?"

Everything that was good about the first game is still here so it's not like relearning an entirely new game, and a lot of the clunkier parts about the first game like enormous skill cooldowns, being locked into 1 or 2 spell trees based on allocated points are refined and looking good. Love the sense of humour of the studio and the hard work and care they put into the game. Recommend highly for people who liked the first D:OS and for people new to the game. Don't need to have played the first D:OS to fully enjoy this one."
Cubertt,377,2,0,October 21,Recommended,213.7,game is good.
Morr-gan,334,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,116.6,"The game's start is an extremely, extreeeemely steep learning curve.  you essentially start off with no armour, and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• weapons, and will be placed against enemies that could 1v1 you and win without breaking a sweat.   Even Dark Souls gives you an easier time starting off than this, trust me.  I recommend playing an Origin character before playing as custom, to get your first experience with a unique character, as the different characters have their own personal questlines and dialogue, which is interesting.  Combat is amazing as ever, however the initiative system has changed from the first one, instead whoever simply has the highest will start (or if it's a scripted boss/enemy to go first), then it will alternate between friend/foe/friend/foe.  Magic Armour and Physical Armour are interesting and basically grants you guranteed immuntie to certain status effects, like Stunned, Knocked down and bleeding unless said armour is reduced to 0. has it's drawback as it means if you dont have the perserverence attribute levelled some you'll get stunlocked in unfortunate positions by mages.  Lots of gametime for the story, with even double if you don't skip all the dialogue and pay attention to side quests (which I didn't).  overall 9/10 some bugs, but overall game is fantastic with a great story."
[EU] DeliveryBoi,325,2,0,July 26,Recommended,165.7,"I consider this the game of the year 2017.  The gaming industry has been lacking super high-quality AAA games that simply tried to create the best possible game in its respective genre - without trying hard to cash-grab and overly cut costs where you really shouldnt. The reception of Witcher 3 simply showed how starved consumers are for such quality-games.  Divinity Original Sin 2...  The game looks absolutely gorgeous. Stunning islands, stunning characters, amazing colors - a feast for the eye.  The universe the developers created is interesting and overall excellent and suits the genre perfectly by adding that extra touch of insanity and therefore supporting player-choices which, quite frankly, are going to be insane more often than not.  The ""R"" in RPG? Delivered.  Replayability - The game often delivers a lot of significant choices how you can influence the world around you and a ton of ways to solve (or terribly mess up) the things you encounter.  Innovation - Modding-support needs to be counted for this one. You can create adventures, mod the base game and even have a complete game-master mode. Features like crafting are an interesting touch for such a game, but can be entirely ignored if youre not into that. Spoiler, if you havent watched the trailer yet:  You can speak with animals, if you pick a trait for that. That's absolutely incredible. Animals simply connect to us on a whole different level. Who wouldnt be touched by some poor, sad puppy eyes, even if its just a game?  The ground-effect based combat is also a nice touch with several connections to that.  The game is fully voiced and even has a narrator. If you really listen closely you can hear that not every voice actor was perfect, but come on, the game is fully voiced and I'm really nitpicky here. Can't hire the best voice actors for a thousand characters and have all of them perform on the same level.  I've got to criticise though that the multiplayer does not have a multiplayer-dialogue function. What I mean by that is that the first player who clicks on the NPC gets to do all the talking without the input of the others. Sure, you can punch each other in Teamspeak and start complaining about choices, but that's no fun. There's a PvP function in the game, but I dont really feel like that's the thing I'd like end up with when I start up a >Coop< session. There should be something like dice-rolls and whoever gets the highest rng, gets to say his line. Something like SWOTOR?.   TL;DR The game offers serious bang for the buck and I'd struggle if you asked me for more recent games of such high quality."
Dogma,64,2,0,"September 4, 2017",Recommended,130.6,"If I were to describe this game in one word it would be ""amazing"". I've been blown away by the early access and left hungering for the full release. Only 10 days to go but its going to feel like a life time!"

I was part of the early access and followed Larian Studio's developer updates every week.  I love how far this game has come and it's been an amazing ride to the final result.  They are continuing to update the game even now after full release to patch out some of the missed bugs which is reassuring.  Unlimited replayability, I've restarted at least 10-15 times now without finishing the game just because I figure something out, or I want to try something else.  Not because what I'm doing is getting stale, but rather that I'm just so curious about different outcomes that I'm compelled to go look at the alternative.   The multiplayer hop in/hop out style is super easy to learn, and I've already started working with the game master mode.  As a DnD GM, I can see the potential of divinity's game master mode, but I can tell it will take some learning and getting use to.  However I dont feel overwhelmed by any of the tutorials they have online, or any of the software.  Thanks for the awesome game."

Almost limitless character development (though you can create op or gimped characters easily, you have to think what to go for) Very immersive, full voice over helps a lot here. 4 player competitive COOP in main campaign PvP arena Master mode to create your own adventures.

Tyrvali,91,2,0,"May 15, 2017",Recommended,201.8," Divinity: Original Sin 2  So, Divinity: Original Sin 2...  I have to say several things about this game before I properly review it. 1) It's in early access alpha at the time of review. 2) Only Act 1 is available, alongside an Arena mode. 3) I loved Divinity: Original Sin  Ok, so, for people who loved the first one, this is a must buy. Even at its current stage of development, which Larian Studios are constantly working on and updating, this is amazing. I have played through the first act as several different characters.  Each playthrough has been similar and different in unique ways. For example, I tried to playthrough the game as a solo Elf Cleric.  The Voidworm fight was nearly impossible for me . I then tried a proper playthrough, using a full party. My character was a Dwarf Rogue. Not only are the classes and races completely different, the combinations of combat were entirely different and I loved it.  I will not lie, however. To people who A) haven't played Divinity: Original Sin, it could be hard to get used to, despite the tutorial help boxes. B) Some elements of the story can break. For example, if Gavin dies before making it back to the camp, you cannot progress in his quest. Note: This is not a game-breaker.  Overall: Since I loved the original, I purchased this game early into its alpha. So far, I've loved every minute. I can't wait for the full release of this masterpiece. Thank you, Larian Studios!  UPDATE: With the full release of the game, I am extremely excited to keep playing. Starting an undead elf character was the first thing I did. I am almost done with Act 1 at the moment and have discovered so many quests, characters and items I previously had no idea about. There are so many things to do and many quests to complete. The cinematics and introductions are a nice touch."

Sure one might actually have to read a few things, but if you like some elements of old RPG games with todays world of graphics, this is an awesome game.  The choices are well thought through, with many options available based on who is simply talking.  It is not a click anywhere type of choice, as you don't get to go back and chose the right path after failing the 3 bad choices.  In that regard the game pace is slowed down. Battles take time to rethink and strategize.   Sometimes you just are not ready, and you need to find better equipment.  The combat systems is pretty much about putting out more damage than the other team can heal and deliver back.  If you ventured into a higher level, there is a good chance you will simly die.  That challange makes it hard to figure out, if you have not found the right strategy or if you need to wait.  Great game.  Well done.

There is so much to say about the game even in the small amount I've played, but the long and the short of it is that the sheer amount of choice it gives you is incredible. Already between my two campaigns I've seen large changes between interactions with characters, different quests, and different class combos. I'm very excited to see everything this game has to offer.  And as a final point, I can't believe that this is an Indie game. In my opinion, this is as entertaining as almost any triple A I've played in the last fair while. I believe anyone who enjoys the fantasty/adventure/D&D genre will enjoy this game, absolutely worth the buy!"
Ihnspyre,193,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,23.3,"This is a cRPG done right:  -  awesome graphics -  fantastic combat and background mechanics -  a lot of freedom -  nice voice acting -  very nice soundtrack  The game is a must buy, Larian did almost everything right in the production department, they listened to critics from the first game, they responded positively to suggestions from fans and worked a lot to improve their game.   This game is exactly that, a very WELL MADE cRPG BUT it lacks a few things that some cRPG fans love about the genre.   Firstly, nothing you see in this game is especially interesting from an artistic point of view. The maps are quite big and full of quests and things to do but there aren't too many WAH moments where you can just admire the artistic design of the map. They are mostly FUNCTIONAL and full of content but uninteresting. While games like Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity have awesome dungeon designs, awesome towns (Twin Elms etc.) and fantastic visual landscapes, D:OS 2 has classic maps with meh design and a lot of secrets.   Most of the game has a lighthearted style of writing, classic personalities for characters, kind of boring lore and story. There aren't too many memorable moments throughout the game (I got very close to the end of the game before getting bored of it on another shared account, bought it for Larian deserved support and future updates + multiplayer) and it really does nothing special except for the combat and mechanics (which are great!). The thing is that we are used to cRPGs full of bugs or questionable developer attitude and when an RPG like D:OS 2 comes out, without a lot of bugs, with a lot of content and fantastic gameplay, well, we tend to overrate it.   The humour was okay, not good and not bad. The party dynamics is not as good as Pillars of Eternity and that cRPG is more suitable for my taste (with complex lore and story, a lot of party interaction, fantastic artistic design and soundtrack).   Overall, Larian deserve a lot of support for being awesome hardworking devs but not for imagination, originality or artistic skills."
Jes527,161,2,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,"1,226.3",I don't normally play turn-based games but the story and characters were so intriguing that I stuck with it and had a ton of fun.  This game really had me emotionally invested and I actually cared about each character.  This game is a must buy. The lore is deep and can be related to many facets of real-life.

Operator Rosell,46,2,0,"October 21, 2017",Recommended,35.1,"Bought the game 3 days ago. Playtime atm 17 hours. Need to be careful with this lads.  Pros -Amazing soundtrack. I have found myself stopped playing 2 times and just listening the soundtrack cause i think it might change if i enter other area. This has not happen to me since Final Fantasy 10. -NPCs are really well written and voice acted. I was amazed by Fane, The Red Prince and the Assasin dude in the beginning. Thats my 3 people party btw. -Turn based combat is really good. It is also challenging even on the lowest level on difficulty. -Game looks amazing with max graphic settings. The water makes me wanna jump in there and swim. -Quests and their completion is done really well. Not one quest feels like a chore and there is actually no direct markings on the map on where to go. It might show you a location of a NPC or location but the rest you have to figure out by yourself. Really nice oldschool vibe init. -I have only been out of the tutorial island and it took me 17 hours. I cant imgaine how much content there is for the rest of the game.  Cons: -Battle might be frustrating in the beginning if you are not familiar with the skills. It took me several attemps on several quests on the normal mode until my party was not demolished by the mobs. This is not really a bad thing cause we need more games that makes us learn the gameplay and try our best but i understand it might frustrate some poeple. -Camera. Camera is pain if you try to change the view all the time but you have to do it in order to loot everything. It takes some time to get used to.  Overall this game is really amazing. It gives me this deep athmospere like when i furst used to play Arcanum or Icewind dale. Totally recommended."
Tally,119,2,0,"November 28, 2017",Recommended,42.0,"Pros:  Absolutely epic!  Fantastic story, nicely done turn-based combat, huge character build variety with endless skill combos, beautiful environments & soundtrack.  There are things to see and do in every corner of the world.   ---  Cons: Camera controls are severely lacking.  The game is so beautiful and I can't see most of it because of the awful camera controls.  Quest tracker leaves a lot to be desired.  I feel like when the fate of the world is hanging in the balance and there is much work to be done, your hero should be writing down a bit more detail in their journal.  ""My lizard friend wants me to find a lizard.""  That's it, no detail and pestering your lizard friend yields no additional information.  I'm just supposed to walk around and talk to EVERY npc until I find the right one.  There is a fair amount of back & forth that is starting to feel tedious.   For example: you stumble upon Z location, but in order to progress through the zone you need X item that is found in Y location.  Go to Y location.   In order to progress through Y location and obtain X item, you must travel to B location to do a quest and unlock a special ability. Go to B location to do said quest and obtain the special ability. Return to Y location, obtain X item, return to Z location. Basically every main story quest is like this, maybe it's because it's my first play through and I'm still learning, but it's getting a little repetitive.  At 25 hours in my save game seems to be getting a bit bloated.  I had this game on my mechanical hard drive and it takes a solid 5 minutes to load Reaper's Coast.  It's a bit less on an SSD but still pretty bad.  ---  Despite all of that, I still think that this game is absolutely worth every penny.  I can see myself playing this game for a long time."

audaciousgenre,246,2,0,"October 23, 2017",Recommended,365.8,"One of the most flexible, polished, detailed, and generally enjoyable games I've ever played. If you like RPGs, you should play this game. Easy to pick up, gameplay can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.   Every character and NPC is voice-acted with individual dialogue, even down to the animals wandering around town - I've never encountered two NPCs who said the same thing. This may not sound huge, but it's a subtle effort that makes the entire experience far more immersive than I've seen in a game. For instance, talking to every random person in a town never feels boring or a chore. It's one of many seemingly minor decision by the creators that elevates the polish and feel of the game above other RPGs, and exemplifies the attention to detail put into every aspect of the game.   The mechanics are great, the graphics are great, controls are great, crafting is good (haven't played with it too much yet), music, writing and voice-acting are absolutely top-notch, skill/magic trees are flexible and mean you can essentially turn anyone in your party into whatever you want. Build archers who also summon and buff creatures to fight for you, two-handed-axe-wielding close-combat necromancers, seriously whatever you want.  I love this game - I'm not even halfway through it, but I already want to start another party just to try out new party builds.  Just get it, unless you're on a serious budget, and even then, it's probably worth skimping on groceries or something this month."

Darkstar,78,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,190.8,"I'm not good at writing reviews, but I feel like I have to give this game one, given how much fun it was. I just finished on Tactician difficulty the first time after having put in around 120 hours of work and I just have to recommend it for anyone who is interested in RPGs and the likes. The amount of content put into this game is astonishing, which in itself is, in my opinion, pretty damn good.  You can select from a lot of different classes and races, which have their own unique strengths and playstyles. And here's basically where one could write a novel about team composition, what's strong and what has better synergy with one another. And so on. Larian did a good job adding this much depth to the already nice combat system of the predecessor.   About the story, I won't spoil anything, but suffice to say: It's amazing. Your companions are interesting. The places you travel to are as well. The NPCs you meet along your journey are fun to interact with and almost always useful, be it in terms of selling you equipment/spells or giving you information about things you might wanna know.  The mechanics of the game are pretty nice to play and experiment around with. The variety by which you can approach battles is quite high in number as long as you're creative. This in turn, again, depends on your group composition, so selecting your option wisely has to be a given, especially on the highest difficulties.  About difficulties, I did struggle quite a bit on Tactician difficulty, since it was the first time I was playing the game. It might seem a little crazy what kind of bonuses the enemies get in terms of armour and HP, but I found them beatable by indeed exploring every little place on the map there was, speaking to almost everybody to get that little extra bit of experience and equipment which might just be enough to beat the next tough battle. As such, it would probably be best to play the game on Classic beforehand, to get an idea of the mechanics and so on.  And that's pretty much it. I enjoyed it a lot and probably will, still, in the future when trying out different compositions and what not. About the Arena mode and Game Master mode, I don't know, since I haven't tried them yet.  tl;dr: If you're a fan of RPGs and got the money, buy this game. I'm sure you won't regret it. :D"

Pio,141,2,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,60.5, The best isometric RPG with turn-based combat to be released since Dragon Age: Origins   Pros:    - Complex and intricate plot  - Interesting dialogs  - Innovative turn-based combat  - Challenging breathtaking battles  - Novel type CO-OP implementation  - Amazing soundtrack   Cons:    - Occasional small stutters and frame drops  - Occasional bugs   Rating:  9/10.
Nakiami,505,2,1,January 14,Recommended,129.9,"playing it on honour mode...  1 battle lasts for hours if u got 4 man co-op,  think of a good move before its your turn, watch ur friends screw over the possibility of making that good move u just thought of, get set on fire by friends over and over, fear everything! (inc. the friends u play with),  run away like a sissy if neccesary!, come back later,  10/10 will probably get set on fire again"
Alariq,278,2,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,65.9,"Yes, I would reccomend this game. Is it the best thing since the invention of pizza since people are claiming? Not really.  The Good:  - Very Pretty Graphics / Reasonably optimized - Great Customization - Fully voiced, great overall quality of acting - Good world building and lore, main story can be a bit convoluted at times. - Reasonably Balanced  The Bad:  - I'm not very fond of a couple of combat systems. I think they have overdone the surface system. Every combat , even the tiniest ones end up a swirling chaos of destruction everywhere with burning/poison/shock/blood what have you everywhere. - Mobs instantly spawn on conveniently placed vantage points to harass you all the time. It's less about organic fights and more like forcing you to reload because you were exploring and not ready for a fight to spawn from thin air. This kinda creates the feeliing that the game is bending the rules against you, cheapening the experience overall. - Mediocre tutorial overall. Fails to tell you some key details like Lizards don't need shovels and skeletons don't need lockpicks. - Some bugs, like only half you party entering combat while the other half watches. You have to manually move your characters into combat, even though they are right there in the first place.  All in all, if you're a fan of CRPGs you'll likely enjoy this as I have. but, if you're new to the genre, there are more friendly places to start."
Greendetective,47,2,0,"April 30, 2017",Recommended,127.9,I was very skeptical about this game.  How can a top down SRPG not be boring?  But after some persuasion from a friend i finally decided to buy it and play it with them and lo' and behold i was astounded by how fun this game is.  The puzzles and battles are the most strategic and amazing srpg battles I seen with environmental destruction being an awesome gimmick. The story is simple yet effective with a huge world with plenty to do and graphics are amazingly beutiful.  I was never bored playing it.  It will be amazing to see this game get finished and voice acting added(which is in the orginal Divinity).  But for an early access it does give you a good taste of the game and you can tell the finished product will be great.

Great roleplaying mechanics, the combat is stellar, character classes and customization has nearly everything you could ask for, and the story is dripping with detail and overall really well written, and the voice acting is impressive.   Each side quest has a bit of personality and flavor to it, it never feels like im just a glorified delivery boy doing fetch quest ad infinium. Its a sprawling adventure full of twists and suprises.

Score : 9/10   The story is very well written set in a fascinating world where CHOICES MATTER. The sidequests are very diverse unlike most games that are filled with fetch quests.   The turn-based combat is very engaging as it rewards you for controlling the battlefield and keeping everyone alive (very important). Patience is key here to prepare setups and counter some status effects (magic and physical).  The early game is VERY tough, much like Xcom 2 where your gears are underleveled so killing enemies at this point is frustatingly difficult even at Classic Mode. Also, once you're done with 1 major area, you'll have to move to a different region so you can't return back to finish any incompleted tasks. So take your time and LEVEL UP!"

Combat is deep and cinematic, both punishing and rewarding. Your party has their own fascinating stories and personalities, and the world your playing in feels chaotic and on the brink of complete anarchy. Its shaping up to be an excellent game, Im already finding myself both wanting more, and eagerly awaiting the September 14th release.

It gives a great sense of immersion.   -very difficult for new players to the genre, no handholding (which is a good thing imo) -the inventory is a clusterf**k. If you arent somewhat patient, you will hate it -quirky dialogue sometimes, this can be seen as positive or negative, Id appreciate a more serious tone, though, it keeps a good balance -colors too bright imo  Thats just the things on top of my head. For every rpg fan, especially oldschool pnp or crpgs fans or just people with a little bit of patience, you re in for a GREAT time. Getting back the feeling of playing nonstop without getting bored.

Draenei For Life (Josh),239,2,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,105.4,"GAME OF THE YEAR FOR ME. ALSO if you play this game keep the black cat alive, trust me its so worth it.   SO the good things about this game: The story/writing has vastly been improved saince the first game, I loved the first one but the story never really pulled me in, this one however pulls me in within the first hour. The combat is still as fun and tactical as the first, with far more combinations of spells and abilities (plus waaayyy more spells, classes and abilities in general). The character creation is fun, its not too long and crazy but allows you to make (or customize an existing character) to be the character you wanna play. The companions are all detailed with decent stories and they all have different impacts on the storyline and each other. Gamemaster Mode is incredible fun, it feels like the D&D campaign creator I've always wanted. This game has up to 4 player multiplayer for the full game, so if you have the friends jump into this with them.   Few neutral things: The music is kind of average, a few fun tunes but feels generic. The crafting system is no longer a cluster of confusing rubbish, so its not a negative, it still doesn't feel very important though, on my solo playthrough and playthrough with friend we both ignore it as it feels still not that useful. Arena mode is a rare giggle but feels kind of incomplete. While its very true many quests allow you to do them  in different ways which is fab, some of them matter little, you will be given like 5 options (if you find them all) to finish a certain part however, you can just run back and do the other options for extra xp for killing them (as I do) making the choice slightly pointless.  Bad things for me (or things I think others will hate): The amount of races is fun (including undead versions), however, it feels like every race is here in vast quantities, no race feels rarer. If you do not like turn based combat this game is NOT FOR YOU AT ALL. Your characters pathing when you tell them to go someone in a fight will still decide to  casually run through fire/poison etc, or sometimes attacks of opportunity make ZERO sense. Gamemaster Mode has no way of making character talk, its all up to the GM. Now this last comment is something that just personally annoys me, but when you need to  help a character in a fight (or save them) they have this tendency to just go full in and take huge quantities of damage, they seem to have dumb AI compared to actual enemies.  I hope my review gave some insight on whether to purchase this game."

briancourt2,105,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,168.1,"Was hesitant becasue of the turn based combat.  But thought hey XCOM was ""turn based"" just the like. This game is really well done.  Sure one might actually have to read a few things, but if you like some elements of old RPG games with todays world of graphics, this is an awesome game.  The choices are well thought through, with many options available based on who is simply talking.  It is not a click anywhere type of choice, as you don't get to go back and chose the right path after failing the 3 bad choices.  In that regard the game pace is slowed down. Battles take time to rethink and strategize.   Sometimes you just are not ready, and you need to find better equipment.  The combat systems is pretty much about putting out more damage than the other team can heal and deliver back.  If you ventured into a higher level, there is a good chance you will simly die.  That challange makes it hard to figure out, if you have not found the right strategy or if you need to wait.  Great game.  Well done.  At first I thought I would wait for a sale, but it is worht the price."
Deathhydrax,22,2,0,"September 20, 2017",Recommended,421.6,"So im 18 hours into the game so far. Running two campaigns, one solo and one with a buddy of mine. I'm a huge fan of Dungeons and Dragons, I have a group that plays every week, and for the days when I'm not playing, this is the game that will scratch that itch.  There is so much to say about the game even in the small amount I've played, but the long and the short of it is that the sheer amount of choice it gives you is incredible. Already between my two campaigns I've seen large changes between interactions with characters, different quests, and different class combos. I'm very excited to see everything this game has to offer.  And as a final point, I can't believe that this is an Indie game. In my opinion, this is as entertaining as almost any triple A I've played in the last fair while. I believe anyone who enjoys the fantasty/adventure/D&D genre will enjoy this game, absolutely worth the buy!"
Ihnspyre,193,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,23.3,"This is a cRPG done right:  -  awesome graphics -  fantastic combat and background mechanics -  a lot of freedom -  nice voice acting -  very nice soundtrack  The game is a must buy, Larian did almost everything right in the production department, they listened to critics from the first game, they responded positively to suggestions from fans and worked a lot to improve their game.   This game is exactly that, a very WELL MADE cRPG BUT it lacks a few things that some cRPG fans love about the genre.   Firstly, nothing you see in this game is especially interesting from an artistic point of view. The maps are quite big and full of quests and things to do but there aren't too many WAH moments where you can just admire the artistic design of the map. They are mostly FUNCTIONAL and full of content but uninteresting. While games like Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity have awesome dungeon designs, awesome towns (Twin Elms etc.) and fantastic visual landscapes, D:OS 2 has classic maps with meh design and a lot of secrets.   Most of the game has a lighthearted style of writing, classic personalities for characters, kind of boring lore and story. There aren't too many memorable moments throughout the game (I got very close to the end of the game before getting bored of it on another shared account, bought it for Larian deserved support and future updates + multiplayer) and it really does nothing special except for the combat and mechanics (which are great!). The thing is that we are used to cRPGs full of bugs or questionable developer attitude and when an RPG like D:OS 2 comes out, without a lot of bugs, with a lot of content and fantastic gameplay, well, we tend to overrate it.   The humour was okay, not good and not bad. The party dynamics is not as good as Pillars of Eternity and that cRPG is more suitable for my taste (with complex lore and story, a lot of party interaction, fantastic artistic design and soundtrack).   Overall, Larian deserve a lot of support for being awesome hardworking devs but not for imagination, originality or artistic skills."

Mokona,31,2,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,22.7,"This review is just based on my first impressions of the game. Its worth getting.  There is an insane amount of skills and combos you can do that a single play through will never allow you to see all the cool stuff you can do so the replay value is high. My favorite thing I've discovered in the game is the way recruiting followers works. First you must convince them to follow you to begin with, they dont just come along because you are the ""chosen one"" or some crap. To boot if you like a character you dont have to worry about him being a mage when you are already a mage because each character asks you what you want them to be. No longer are you forced to not take your favorite npc with you or forced to play a class you dont like just to take it with you. You can finally have a balanced party full of npc you find interesting hurrah.  The only thing I would ""complain"" about is the lack of non human races. You got human, dwarf (small human), elf (vegetarian human), and lizard man (finally its not a human). Skeleton variations of all is nice to throw in but I honestly am just done with every fantacy game haveing there races be the 3 over used races, human, elf, dwarf, and then a final race being there own ""custom"" race that just turn out to be another human but blue or something like that. Glad we got lizard men but wish we had a few more.  This game has a lot of thought put into it and it somehow didn't lauch at the $60 price point, with mod support. I expected this to be as dissapointing as pillars of eternity was but just jumping into the character creation and I was already loving the game."

Andy Dwyer,656,2,0,"November 9, 2017",Recommended,74.5,"Probably the longest review I have ever written or will ever write, unless Original Sin 3 comes soon, SO, TL:DR; This has become my favorite game of all time. It's the best CRPG I've played since the old school ones, and then adds more mechanics and better story telling.   Pros: -Elemental Interactions -Companions so good I had a hard time picking who to bring in my party -Fun combat and mechanics -Excellent puzzle design for Acts I and II, and just really really good puzzle design in Act III.  -Compelling storyline, that ties in neatly with the other Divinity games, without requiring you to play them (though you should) -No microtransactions, season pass, loot boxes, etc.  -Able to respec your character as much as you want -Excellent skill management system -Excellent crafting systems -Excellent visuals in regard to spell effects and great art design -Excellent RPG elements, relative to character creation, talents, skills and tags -The music is off the charts for the most part -Great voice acting and sound design -Choices that actually matter during the story and change the story -Oddly descriptive ""intamacy"" scenes if you romance a character (is that a pro, maybe, it was well written) -Difficult enought that I was challenged and died plenty on the second highest difficulty, but never felt frustrated enough to quit or scum the game -Excellent game, because there's no other word I can use to describe it.   Cons: -Had a crashing issue during a few of the cut scenes between Acts -Music repeats a lot if you're repeatedly getting in and out of combat -Items like arrows and grenades get auto added to your hot bar, and I constantly had to clean it out for skills to be in the order I want, playing as a polymorph character I had a lot of skills appearing and disappearing between combat  Overall, you should play this game if you like turn based CRPGs, RPGs in general, turn based games, good games or even if you just want to support a great indie game dev. It reminded me of Dark Souls 1, where when I finished my first playthrough, I instantly made a new character, and started to play again with a completely different play style.  Update: you should also nominate and vote for this game whenever possible, so it can get some well deserved praise."

jkr000,40,2,0,"November 8, 2017",Recommended,327.6,"Arguably the best RPG I've played. No Micro transactions or any additional fees to play. Best when playing with another player (up to 3 additional players). Tons of lore, story, and ways to deal with most situations. Lots of freedom in how you want to play the game.   Downside is that combat isn't as frequent and leveling does tend to be on the slower side. You'll spend more time gearing up or chatting than doing anything else. Enemies, in general, are on the weaker side, so sometimes combat doesn't feel as rewarding.   Fun moments: -Trying to break into the ship's kitchen ends with the entire ship blowing up. -Battling asssassins in one motel room, while listening to npcs in another room talk about their love life.  -The moment my cousin and I realize the food we've been eating was made of the local law enforcement that continues to go missing.  -The moment my cousin and I realize what the gods were planning leading to a an epic betrayal of all betrayals.  -Failing to save a family from an execution leading to all out war in the oil fields.  -Realizing the badguys at the end had a very reasonable endgame to their scheme that would have led to the best kind of ending you could get in the game.  -Having my cousin backstab me as I attempt to take Divinity for myself (I won't forget this cuz. I hope you enjoy all those arrows in your face.).   Overall the experience was enjoyable. I cannot wait for a sequel to this game."
YagDridge,191,2,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,32.8,"This game is a true gem. I really enjoyed Divinity: Original Sin but it had many flaws that made my playstyles limited difficulty wise. In this game all those minor/big issues I had with the series is gone.  One of my favorite things about this game is all the dialog options and more are available depending on your race, and tags. The random things you can do and play with your own style to pass are just amazing and leave me with a complete immersive feeling at all times. I'm still in the tutorial zone at nearly 9 hours because im taking it nice and slow while reading all that dialog. A somewhat early review but I've already noticed ALL my nitpicks from the first game have been addressed in this game.  Major improvements that I love from the last game: + More Dialog choices + Recruiting any new member gives you the choice to select their class allowing for a party of your choice as well + Selling an item worth a lot of money gives you quick reputation with traders + Killing someone in town away from everyone doesn't make the entire world hate you in this game + New Classes/Undead! + Very informative tutorial + New armor/movement/combat system that feels perfected for turn based + Inventory enhancements making it really easy to deal with all party members quickly + Co-op + 4 Players + Crafting"
Lobster Dominance Hierarchy,30,2,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,364.3,"Great game! The Larian team has done it again. I'm happy for them, especially considering the studios history when they were taken advantage of in the past. I particularly like the shout outs and throwbacks to the DOS1, and I'm no where near done the game yet. If you are wanting a role playing strategy game where you actually interact with your companions, and who have their own motives/goals then this is the game for you.  Pros: - More skills. Dear God the old game was lacking in skill variety, really noticable late game. Good to see they improved this. - Diologue is great! - Lore is great! - Deatail in game world - Humor, and a at times snarky narrator - Different ways of solving a quest  Pro/Con: - Graphicks are amazing as ever, but lag the heck out of your computer when you are in the forest/city and not in a building - Crafting is more streamlined but waaaay harder when experimenting as it's less straightforward as DOS1. Good/bad I don't know.  Cons: - Still a little bugy/brocken quests. Nothing too serious as there is ushally a work around. But I came accross my first broken quest bug in Act 2, as in no way to start it as item didn't appear in inventory. Also the game sometimes crashes, so be sure to save often, especially if you open up a new window to google something.  So there you have it a great game, and dare I say if the studio waited a month to release the game to fix these bugs the game may have even been called immaculate? Hope it gets some more patches soon!  EDIT: A little deeper into the game and a little saltier at some of the bugs, *cough* tarquin *cough* as I found a few more broken quest bugs. This game is definitely released a month too early. Still a great game... just waiting on some more patches..."

The freedom to do whatever and the ""hidden"" things you can make or counteract various parts of the game make it really fun to just keep messing with. Like crafting nails with boots to make shoes that are slip proof (ice), I had no idea it would even work like that but the novelty of figuring that one out was fantastic!  This game gives you the flexibility to kill anyone, and I mean anyone. You might pay for it if you aren't high enough level to attack them but you still have the chance to ink out a victory from dire straits.   The conversations are rich and your dialogue can actually have a meaningful impact on your game.   I would highly encourage to play coop with your friends, its a load of fun!

Defeating enemies after a long battle with no one dying because the both of us expertly communicated with one another over who to hit and what moves to make, etc, is extremely satisfying.

Clearly they listened to what the people wanted and gave it to us.  You have the freedom to build the charactor how ever you want.  I can not reccomend this game enough.  The game had a major bug when I first bought it thats now resolved (If you were player 2 and a summoner your spells would vanish and your summon wouldnt have their abilities only auto attack).  But like I said that was already resolved.  The game in its current state I give a 9/10.

Graphic (despite the clunky character potraits) and sound are excellent and detailled.   Future rpgs have let themselves to be measured on what Larian Studios achieved here.   The last ~50% of the game (act3-5) sure seem a bit rushed. The magic of the first 2 acts is not entirely gone but fades until the game becomes from time to time slightly annoying in act 5.   Still one of the best ""classical"" rpgs I ever played.   And please change the either groupwide magic dmg or physical dmg concept. On higher difficulties it makes no sense to go with a mixed group. One form of armor should be enough."

Krysle Quinsen,593,2,0,"November 13, 2017",Recommended,110.4,"This game can be co-op up to four players and there is PVP arena mode as well as GM mode. But I never tried it. So it will be an overall review in single player perspective.  The Story is awesome, it's about god and stuff, the writing is exceptional as well as voiceover, which is mostly a narrator style (think Bastion). Dialog choice is a 3rd person rather than a sentence. The plot twist is good, the lore is great and not out of places (most fantasy game that contains gods and magic mostly not explained well.) and are all connected with every character in the game. There's some noticeable rush in writing in the last act, though.  The puzzle is OK, not much pixel-hunting but last act is not that great and might confusing.  The Quest system is well-designed, there's not much hand-holding and marker much and you can literally kill everyone and not break the game. However, quest item can be sold or dropped, be careful about it.  There are 4 playable races in this game, Human, Lizard, Elf, Dwarf, all with their Skeleton version (8 in total) and can be customized, their lore is interested and not that cliche, the design is very exotic for Lizard. However, Elves do have some weird armor and facial but have interesting lore.  The Combat is just good in tactical stuff, this game used the Round-Robin style where you move one character for each turn, who have the highest initiative(speed). Because of this, a lot of thinking will be required whenever you want to burst someone down or set up some potential combo with environment effects using magic. (Oil/Poison + Fire = Burning Ground, Water + Electricity = Electrical Water or perhaps turning Burning into Steam then electrified it? or blessed fire for healing instead?) There's friendly-fire on magic, so be careful not to kill your melee characters. This game used Armor system (think Barrier from shooting game like Mass Effect) where most negative effect only worked when particular armor is depleted. Which IMHO, work better than RNG system in the first game. AI is also meanie, so don't go in blindly or grouped up too much. They're quite smart. There's quite balance issue in the late game, though, where you literally OP, especially with the usage of Source Abilities.  Although The Music isn't composed by Kirill Pokrovsky (RIP) but Borislav Slavov (Crysis Series) is doing a great job also! the theme is very memorizable, The Rivellon Theme is just too good, the combat music is nice (which also based on instrumental selected on character creation), The Battle for Divinity is story climax combat. There's one vocal song too.  Crafting, however, not that useful and a couple of recipes are useful. You might pick up a lot of junk thinking it as crafting mats, only to be used with one common scroll recipe.  This game support Modding, means there will be QoL mod, overhaul or a campaign for you to play. This disables achievement but there's a mod for it.  TL/DR: Looking for a good single/co-op cRPG with exceptional story and lore that is well-connected with awesome races (Lizard <3), a tactical turn-based combat that required a lot of strategies, perhaps just a game OST for your collection, or doing some RP with Game Master mode? then go ahead, full price!  Now, that's the potential GOTY award for 2017. My The ‚ÄúSuspension of Disbelief‚Äù Award.  PS: I don't write a review much, so it might be messy, I'll try to improve or perhaps changes the style."
Binkow,345,2,0,"November 13, 2017",Recommended,61.1,"Fantastic game.  Lovely design, lovely soundtrack, lovely gameplay.   The few ending battles are some of the best I've ever fought, and for $45 it's definitely worth it. I did a decent amount of side quests but probably about 60-70%, so there's probably another 20-25 hours in this game (did 60 hours at the time of this review).   "
reckoning,233,2,0,"November 26, 2017",Recommended,107.9,"Amazing game. So much love and effort was put into this and it is VERY noticeable. The music is amazing, the characters are amazing, setting is beautiful, the quests are engaging and sometimes hilarious. Worth way more than the price tag."
Styre,165,2,0,"December 21, 2017",Recommended,85.4,"My favorite game this year. Really incredible.   Pros: + Great combat. + Interesting story. + Followers are interactive and a good addition to the game. + The quests are interesting. Some are tricky and that's a good thing. + The graphics are great. + Lots of content (My first playthrough was 70 hrs long!) + Replayable + Well optimized. + Incredible music and dialogues are great too.  Cons:  - There are some minor bugs.   That's about it.   This game is really good. Especially due to the fact that it has a really good price for the quality and quantity of content, and also because the game is enjoyable as heck. Buy this game and support the fantastic devs!"

Salahn,137,2,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,300.5,"Highly recomend for anyone who loves RPG's.   This game keeps all the good elements of the 1st original sin and improves on it greatly,   Pros :- Great story. Beautiful graphics and performance on a average spec PC. Indepth tactical turn based combat system. Build your player characters you want, not restricted to classes. Choose what class your companions are. Choices, lots of them, play the way you want.  Cons :- Minor bugs at release, very few and being fixed quickly with daily patches. Gamepad UI and controls are awefull, you'll want to use keyboard & mouse. So adictive you wont sleep ;p  10/10  This game is going to be a classic !"
Arexious,149,2,0,"September 22, 2017",Recommended,87.2,This game exceeded all of my expectations.  The best co-op game I've ever played.
The Lie,38,2,1,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,66.8,"Well, I bought the first Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition on Gog.com a while ago, and happily sunk many hours into it. It was one of the better RPG's I had played (And holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•have I played a lot), and it left me excited when I heard they were releasing a sequel. That sequel is now here, and 7 hours into this game, all I can say is...I usually only set aside time for two activities in my life, playing video games and wacking my weasel. This game is providing such an entertaining and immersive experience thus far, that I may be having to neglect my weasel a little more to make time for this adventure.  I won't ignore my weasel entirely though. I don't believe there will ever be a game to make that miracle happen, but this game has definitely left my weasel feeling a little jealous.  In a blue nut shell....9/10. Although it is only lacking a 10/10 because I am still in the infancy stages of the game and would not want to post a premature perfect score. This review may be revised, but as of now, if you like RPG's, quit bashing your bacon, jerking your turkey, or pounding your pud for a moment, and buy this gem. =)"
Sartori,136,2,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,42.9,"I am one of those old codgers who was playing Baldur's Gate back in the day.  Anyone who even remotely enjoys that kind of old-school RPG will absolutely love this game.  My advice is: don't try to rush it.  Initially, I got impatient, and decided to go look up how to get off Starter Island.  Imagine my disgrace to find out how many ways there are to get off Starter Island.  Just explore, push the envelope, connect dots, and it will happen eventually.  That, in a nut shell, sums up my impression of how to succeed at this game.  Early combat can be brutal.  Explore, build up your gear and your abilities, learn the ropes, and you will prevail.  At times, combat can seem like the whole world is on fire.  Learn to master the chaos, and the enviornment, and you will crush your foes into gelatinous goo.  Well... be that as it may... if you enjoy old-school RPG, if you love a good story, if you you enjoy melting your enemies into gelatinous goo, then you will not find a better title than Divinity: Original Sin 2."
Twitch.TV/KebertTV,68,2,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,44.0,So this is my first review and I want to say that I havent even beat the first chapter but ill let all the people kind of unsure about this game know.

Cybnir,88,2,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,94.8,"If you are a true oldschool rpg fan, in search for an rpg packed with content, then this is for you.  As a bigtime fan of oldschool rpgs or especially crpgs, Im stunned by the sheer amount of work the devs put in it. After a long dark time without games that hold you for HOURS stuck on your chair, Im excited like a little kid.  +challenging, tactical turn based combat +loot! Feels special and it always nice to upgrade your peers. Really digging the additional skills you get from certain items +A story that keeps you interested +Great setting, the atmosphere is intense, so is the graphics +NO HANDHOLDING, if you ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up, you ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up. Especially at the beginning you will feel overwhelmed, but it has a nice progression/learning curve +Maps, markers, lore, books, its all there +Interesting companions throughout +Crafting is deep but simple, it also takes a little bit of work to get it going +The game lets you play and act like an oldschool pen and paper rpg. You are somewhat free how you overcome certain challenges (sneaking, plain combat, hidden entry, talking, persuasion.........) +Consequences of your choices +FULL VOICE ACTING. Everything is voice acted, from the narrator to every little npc you see. It gives a great sense of immersion.   -very difficult for new players to the genre, no handholding (which is a good thing imo) -the inventory is a clusterf**k. If you arent somewhat patient, you will hate it -quirky dialogue sometimes, this can be seen as positive or negative, Id appreciate a more serious tone, though, it keeps a good balance -colors too bright imo  Thats just the things on top of my head. For every rpg fan, especially oldschool pnp or crpgs fans or just people with a little bit of patience, you re in for a GREAT time. Getting back the feeling of playing nonstop without getting bored. Sleepless videogame nights are to come.   After finishing the first real act, I had to write a review, because they deserved the praise they get. Thats how you make games. Big like an ocean and deep like an ocean."
Draenei For Life (Josh),239,2,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,105.4,"GAME OF THE YEAR FOR ME. ALSO if you play this game keep the black cat alive, trust me its so worth it.   SO the good things about this game: The story/writing has vastly been improved saince the first game, I loved the first one but the story never really pulled me in, this one however pulls me in within the first hour. The combat is still as fun and tactical as the first, with far more combinations of spells and abilities (plus waaayyy more spells, classes and abilities in general). The character creation is fun, its not too long and crazy but allows you to make (or customize an existing character) to be the character you wanna play. The companions are all detailed with decent stories and they all have different impacts on the storyline and each other. Gamemaster Mode is incredible fun, it feels like the D&D campaign creator I've always wanted. This game has up to 4 player multiplayer for the full game, so if you have the friends jump into this with them.   Few neutral things: The music is kind of average, a few fun tunes but feels generic. The crafting system is no longer a cluster of confusing rubbish, so its not a negative, it still doesn't feel very important though, on my solo playthrough and playthrough with friend we both ignore it as it feels still not that useful. Arena mode is a rare giggle but feels kind of incomplete. While its very true many quests allow you to do them  in different ways which is fab, some of them matter little, you will be given like 5 options (if you find them all) to finish a certain part however, you can just run back and do the other options for extra xp for killing them (as I do) making the choice slightly pointless.  Bad things for me (or things I think others will hate): The amount of races is fun (including undead versions), however, it feels like every race is here in vast quantities, no race feels rarer. If you do not like turn based combat this game is NOT FOR YOU AT ALL. Your characters pathing when you tell them to go someone in a fight will still decide to  casually run through fire/poison etc, or sometimes attacks of opportunity make ZERO sense. Gamemaster Mode has no way of making character talk, its all up to the GM. Now this last comment is something that just personally annoys me, but when you need to  help a character in a fight (or save them) they have this tendency to just go full in and take huge quantities of damage, they seem to have dumb AI compared to actual enemies.  I hope my review gave some insight on whether to purchase this game."
Toastmold,197,2,0,"September 22, 2017",Recommended,188.4,I think it is excellent. Great writing and some nice turn-based combat. More polished than previous Divinity games. A fair bit of replayability.

Butler,139,2,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,89.9,"Loved Divine Divinity, one of Larian's first RPGs back in the early 2000s. So I knew they had talent but, bizarrely, they've spent the last 15 years making very average games (with the first Original Sin being a possible exception).  But this is something else. They've nailed it. It feels like they've finally made the game they wanted to make all those years ago.  It's hard to list everything good about it, but the writing, the voice acting, the world building, the character development, the questing structure, the combat... it's all so effortlessly brilliant.   It makes other genre greats like Pillars of Eternity look extremely average. And, if it isn't already, I can see it becoming one of my favourite RPGs ever. "

Mr Engineer,77,2,0,October 30,Recommended,135.4,"Finally finished the game, so let's review:  Pros: Very in-depth RPG, there are a lot of opportunities to personalize your character and play style. Tactical turn based combat. Loads of interesting quests packed with different ways to complete them. Four player co-op! Even though my experience was exactly as chaotic as you may expect. Adding to the above point, you can do almost anything and fight anyone without breaking the game! Cons: Some bugs will make you wish you saved more often (ex. characters frozen in dialogue, armor buffs not applying anymore). Players can sometimes progress quests, even origin character personal quests or big story shifting moments, without input from other players. Were you the first guy in the room? Well, hope you have high persuasion and/or need to talk to the NPCs because your pals are out of luck! Decide for yourself: 80-100 hours of content for one playthrough! Most of the RNG elements from DOS1 have been stripped away for a more straight forward, if not always more rewarding, experience (ex. armor system to resist cc, character tags open up new dialogue options but don't provide any combat/civil buffs). Combat cheese, or abusing the system... I haven't encountered an impossible fight yet, but there are plenty that can be made a lot easier by adding some deathfog barrels, applying buffs while in dialogue before the fight, fleeing with one character to get full health before returning to the fight, etc. Ending spoiler  No matter how you played before, unless you swear to the god king or demon, you can choose any ending you want Mass Effect 3 style.  Overall, I would completely recommend this game. I even started another playthrough!"
