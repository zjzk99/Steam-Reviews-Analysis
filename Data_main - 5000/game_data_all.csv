Zac,383,7,2,February 26,Not Recommended,201.2,"I have never been more ambivalent about a game before in my life. I have never played a game with such amazing concepts and potential, squandered by fundamental failings of game design.  The fine first, second, and third acts, while plagued with the issues I am going to discuss, are not nearly as horrible as the absolutely baffling experience of act 4. All issues previously felt in the game are so excacerbated in act 4, that I thought I was playing an entirely different game.  1. The armor system incentivizes perversely unfun tactics. With the recent changes of taunt, they have thankfully recognized this. Nonetheless, it causes both the players and the AI to initially launch into DEFCON 1 tier nuclear exchange, with the victor emerging as the one to freeze, knockdown, or terrify (fittingly, the most terrifying effect constantly abused by the AI) their opponent. When the encounters start becoming quite difficult, this exchange can pretty much decide the outcome of the battle in 2 turns.  2. The AI in this game is awful. They are completely incapable of working to together and effectively chaining combos. So, in compensation, the developers have simply cheated ridiculous stats onto the AI, often allowing them 6 AP regen per turn, insane armor values, and a divinity level capability of using source. At one instance, a random AI sourcerer had an initiative of 50... why? It inexplicably had a base initiative of +20... If you encounter an enemy called 'nemisis,' evacuate to your nearest fallout shelter because they deserve the title of godwoken over all else.  3. Rapid descent into over-designed gimmick encounters, often with no communication of what to do. Act 4 is especially egregious about this. I have no idea why they decided endlessly respawning enemies, ambushes, and gimmick bosses  were good ways of designing a game, but it is not. It shows complete insecurity in their combat system that they needed to replace every regular fight with some poor attempt at twisting the formula. Ultimately, it either ends with the player figuring out the gimmick and beating the encounter easily, or a frustrating cycle of save cheesing until the correct tactic is found. Its like... the previous 3 courses of this game's meal was just a delicious italian dinner, and instead of desert being a logical extension of what came before it, its dog diarrhea plated to look like chocolate mousse... yeah... its unique, but its ♥♥♥♥ing♥♥♥♥♥♥ Just like every late game fight in this game.  Unfortunately, the game's stellar writing was unable to save the experience for me. I honestly recommend turning on explorer mode if you do decide that is what you want to get out of this game."
Shogoki,91,42,5,February 25,Not Recommended,31.9,"Divinity 2: Original Sin is beautiful, with a great soundtrack and the world design is also appealing. But i'm not gonna recommend it and here's why.  The game counters it's own logic. Tells you to do whatever you wants, put an emphasis on freedom, character creation, dialogue, roleplay, etc, but you must play EXACTLY like the developpers intended you to if you wanna succeed. That means, finishing as much quests as you can so your level is high enough for you to be able to win fights on your own terms. So the optional quests are in fact, mandatory. You don't like some quests ? Too bad, since you cannot grind because the mobs don't respawn. But that's not the whole story about quests. The maps are quite open, giving you the illusion of freedom, but when you discover a map for the first time, you'll realise that most of it is gated by high level mobs that are going to kill you outright if you engage combat against them, thus restricting the exploration the game strangely emphases, and forcing your hand into doing things in the exact order the devs wanted you to do them. If you try to do quest B before quest A, you will die because of how much a one or two level difference with your opponent means. That's not to mention the fact that some quests are gated behind a perk/stat/item requirment. It's like Cat Mario / Syobon Action, where you have levels loaded with traps and obstacles you can't possibly anticipate, so you finish them by dying on every single obstacle at least once and memorizing safe zones.  The combat system is also restricting, because of the way armor works, it's much more rewarding to set up all your characters into doing one type of damage (physical or magical) to finish fights quicker.  I wanted a wizard to support my knight but that would have been a bad idea. Because why would anyone lose time into emptying a full magical armor bar if the physical one has been grinded to zero through the physical attacks you already delivered ? Being able to do damage by mixing chemicals and using the environment is a good idea, the bad thing is that those chain-reactions are usually triggered early in the fight, be it by your own attacks or your opponent's, at a time where armors are not destroyed yet, thus nullifying many effects or debuffs they could create.  Nobody is sitting there, being like ""Omg this game is too hard, i can't advance !"" - people ARE advancing, but it is tedious and annoying. Not because it is ""omg, so oldschool, so hardcore"", but because the game fails to hold true to it's own principles and employs point-&-click adventure logic in many places. You are supposed to magically know how the devs wants you to approach a particular quest, area or fight. If you don't, you are going to fail, miss things, and die a lot. A good example of that would be Braccus pants. An item you can only find if your character is over a certain threshold in a certain stat, and make him interact with a particular item at a particular place, while nothing pointed that you should do that. There is a difference between not holding the player's hand and dumping them into a situation that cannot be managed unless you already have first hand experience or information.  So yeah, i wanted to love this game but it is simply not amusing. It's not a challenge in the sense that you have to improve your level of comprehension of mechanics that make sense, it's simply a matter of knowing things in advance. In Dark Souls, you can win fights on your own terms by, let's say, becoming very good at avoiding attacks and counter-attacking. Or you can be a god at min-maxing, setting up stats the right way to make a great build that's gonna make the game much easier. In DoS:2, you cannot win on your own terms. I should not have to steal every painting in the game to keep my economy flowing so i can buy gear to stay relevant in battle. I should not have to kill every non-quest related NPC so i can grind all the XP not to get crushed in battle. I should not have to back-stab bosses without talking to them and miss important story elements or sacrifice my amusement because of cheesy tactics being the only way to win some fights.  This ""You have to know it before you even attempt"" mechanic is not bad as is. I have no real problem with games that does that, however, i have one if they advertise themselves as putting the emphasis on player choice while it's clearly not how the game is designed to be played."
Martyr81,83,39,1,"October 10, 2017",Not Recommended,106.1,"Upfront, I'll say this game does have some fun gameplay at times. However a litany of problems make me give this a negative review.  - Dumbfoundingly inconsisent difficulty. Battles range from entertainingly fun to stupendously, insultingly difficult. Seriously, you should never have to go into a battle knowing EXACTLY what is going to happen in order to have a chance of surviving (not winning, just surviving). And the only reason you know what's about to happen is because you've tried it half a dozen times and failed each time.  - Weak story compared to D:OS, and heavy use of sad, tired and predictable tropes. Half the time it wasn't even clear what we were trying to accomplish, and who/what we were fighting against or for. And when major plot points did occur, most of the time our response was ""Really? We're doing this again? Sigh...""  - For a game that encourages you to forge your own way, it punishes you for not following some pre-assumed path through the world. Heaven help you if you choose a different direction - enemies do not scale with level, and gear that would help you manage is prohibitively expensive. So if you head west when the game expects you to head east, you'll struggle.  - Battles that break the game's own pre-established rules. Examples: repeat casting of abilities which have multi-round cooldowns, and stacking identical status ailments. Case in point: The Sallow Man's Airborne Plague, which bypasses all armour (physical and magical), stacks with itself (I was at -15 Con at one point because of three repeat casts) and can be cast EVERY ROUND.  - Inconsistent lore/world impacts: you can kill someone and consume their soul, only for them to show up again later, apparently none the worse for wear. (Yay, that achieved a lot...).  - Multiplayer feels like two single player games occurring simultanously, with some quests not progressing or closing because the wrong player spoke to the quest giver. To add to that, if the speaker doesn't have the required item for a fetch quest, too bad - having it in the party isn't enough (but the game doesn't let you know that, does it? That would be too much to ask...)  - Quest system is broken. Somewhat repaired with a patch, but if you'd progressed past a certain point, the damage was done. The Tarquin side-quest was just a balls-up.  - My partner, who was using a controller (I use keyboard/mouse), had endless difficulty with target selection and interactions with the environment. Certain skills just wouldn't work (no reason was given - you just can't select this character because we say so). The controller interface also made line-of-sight hard to gauge, so several times critical actions were lost because of some unseen obstacle.  - Multi-stage boss battles: stop, just stop with this tired, over-used and just irritating chiche. This has been done so many times it's just not interesting, exciting or surprising.  - Some puzzles have an exact solution required, but the game gives you absolutely no guidance or hints. Another case in point: the Cursed Revenants in the Lizard Embassy. We gave up trying to solve that and just left them there. We got around them enough to finish the quest, but they'll be sitting there in the ruins till Judement Day.  More on the battle difficulty: if you're at the correct character level for a given encounter (ie a L5 party against L5 opponents) I don't think it's unreasonable that your party members are able to survive the opening salvo. I GM a Pathfinder group and so understand that some encounters are meant to be more challenging that others, depending on their importance in the plot progression. However, given that in 95% of encounters one or more of the opponents invariably go first, the number of times one (or more) of our party members were one-shot killed or disabled before they've had a chance to act is kinda ludicrous. This ties back into my previous point where you have to know exactly what is about to happen in order to have a chance of getting through the battle (which I consider meta-gaming in a cRPG). Sure, give the enemies superior starting positions and outnumber the party, but don't compount that by making every mook immediately superior to the whole party.  For a game that we've spent over 100 hours on, this has left such a bitter taste in my mouth that I can't say I've enjoyed it. We've given up trying to win the final battle, and to be honest I couldn't care less about how it ends. There were occasional moments of fun, but the negatives outweigh them."
Jobbut,198,8,0,"September 25, 2017",Not Recommended,137.0,"[Spoiler-Free Review] Foreword: The game is not reccomended for a few major reasons: 1. It lacks serious mechanical polish; if you played the first game, expect to be disappointed by many of the mechanics. 2. The game is seriously bugged, the majority of quests are very likely to break and become uncompletable-- Including the entire endgame sequence. 3. Acts 3, 4, and the endgame lack the content and polish of the first two acts, and were clearly rushed out the door.

Beeps,97,122,5,"October 6, 2017",Not Recommended,90.0,"Much like the first game, Divinity Original Sin 2 is a fun game that seems to only be fun purely by accident. There's so much to unpack here that I genuinely suspect that the developers were just randomly throwing darts at a board to decide game elements--at best. At worst they were being intentionally lazy--possibly even intentionally provocative at points.  A lot of the major problems have been harped on about to the point where I dont' feel the need to mention them, but for the sake of the uninformed: the armor system in this game is entirely pass/fail, you either have armor and you resist everything or you don't and you resist nothing. The turn order is mindbogglingly terrible, working on a round robin (enemy goes then you go then enemy goes and repeat) system that seems to heavily favor the enemy. The game is literally unfinished, Act 4 was shuffled together out of planks of wood and has blatant cut corners in the form of poor scripting, low effort dialogue, low effort area design, pointless quests and voice acting that varies from being poor to simply not existing. Act 3 is not much better. Inventory management is somehow worse than the first game.   I think the best way I could describe the act of playing DOS2 is that if it feels like you are gaming the system, you are probably playing the game the way the developers intended. In someways this is what makes the game fun--I had a very similar experience with New Vegas, where playing the game on the yellowbrick road was boring as sin, but intentionally breaking the quests in ways that favored me was extremely satisfying. What makes DOS2 less satisfying than New Vegas, however, is that in DOS2, the things that break the game are things that the developers knew full well would break it. It is an intentionally asymmetrical experience. Things like teleporting enemies away from their allies and ganking them, planting explosive barrels around enemies before triggering a fight, stacking up on a certain resistance to the point where you heal from an element--these things are how the game is designed to be played.   This of course means that certain abilities are comparitively bad because they don't do key things like strip armor, reposition allies/enemies, heal, apply surfaces, etc. The top three non-source abilities in DOS2 (Which are probably: Teleportation, Shackles of Pain, Invisibility--which special mentions to Summon Bone Widow and Rain) are so unbelievably powerful that you are gimping yourself to an extreme degree if you do not use them. Balance was clearly of no concern here.  On Tactician mode, ""cheese strats"" like the ones I mentioned are so ubiquitious that I legitimately do not understand how the developers intended certain encounters to be beaten. Of particular note is one instance where I needed to save a lizardwoman from the gallows, who was being hung by a single tough guard and her slave. Easy enough, just kill two people. The problem was--as soon as you instigate the fight, the guard literally summons four equally strong guards from thin air, all of which are right next to her so repositioning her is useless. This *by itself* would be a very challenging encounter, but it gets better. The woman had a permanent aura on her that increased her dodging abilities and those of her allies to ludicrous degrees--meaning I basically could not hit her, or anyone around her. The way I beat this encounter was, no joke--teleporting her three times in a row, at max range, into another encounter entirely with some evil bug things, and the bugs killed her.  The encounter I just spoke about could have been talked about with the same words, but in an entirely positive tone. Because technically, I just teleported a woman three blocks away and had bugs rip her apart. And that's ""awesome"". Truth be told, it actually was somewhat fun. The crux of the issue is this: the rational person inside of me is screaming in agony when I play Divinity, while the fun-loving idiot inside of me is very satisfied. I know for a fact that this encounter was unbelivably poor. But because I beat it in a *special* way, I'm almost tricked into believing blatant disregard for things like balance, fairness, and sensibility produced something cool. It's like junk food. It's a momentary rush that quickly wears off when you realize that ""cool trick"" you pulled off was probably just a set of drapes set up to hide a super ♥♥♥♥ed up game.  A lot of the encounters are like that, except some are even worse, in that the ""trick"" to the fight is the literal one way to proceed. There's a witch that will set up a MASSIVE fire resistance debuff on your party and then cast a fire spell, instantly killing the entire group. The only way to beat this fight without losing a party member is to bless the flames underneath her so you get fire immunity before she casts her debuff. Once you do that the fight is a cakewalk. It is an actual puzzle with one solution.  There are other encounters that are just laughably bad. If I played a tabletop RPG where a DM pit me against 15 slow moving clay soldiers that respawn indefinitely until one of them is killed, where each of them gets their own turn and they only have one attack, I would quit that game on the spot. There's another fight that's such a literal waste of your time it's unreal. You start out with dozens of oil slugs, which turn into more slugs, which turn into fire slugs, which ignites the oil and causes the whole area to be lit on fire, which heals the slugs and hurts you. Also every slug has a ton of HP. That fight took me FIFTY FIVE MINUTES but only took me one try.  The final fight: I audibly laughed when I realized the final battle is just an immense battle royale between three factions, where both the magisters and the antagonist's forces have 5+ people and each of them gets at least three actions per turn. I seriously just played dead with my undead characters and WATCHED the fight happen, until only one enemy remained with a tiny amount of HP. This sort of♥♥♥♥♥♥should not be the optimal strategy in the climax of the game. Still somehow was not worse than the last fight of DOS1!  In my DOS1 review, I said the game was flawed to an unbelivable extent, but that I had fun, so I gave it a thumbs up. Why does that not apply here? Because the context behind the game makes the state of the product totally unforgivable.  To begin, DOS2 was a kickstarter project after DOS1 had already gotten kickstarted and been the most successful game for Larian in...ever. Additionally, DOS2 was in early access for almost a year and a half, supposedly to gain feedback to improve the product. Larian got feedback, and they ignored it. Changes to the armor system were heavily requested. Changes to the initiative system were heavily requested. Changes to the stat system were heavily requested. None of these things happened. As far as I can tell, Larian did not make a single change to the game during early access that actually made the game better, with the sole exception of adding full voice acting--which was probably planned anyway but only carried out during the pre-release hype.   The best part? DOS2 came out unfinished after a YEAR of early acess and a huge crowdfunding campaign. Even ignoring the fact that Act 4 is rushed-out trite, I cannot understand that a high-budget crowdfunded sequel was released with multiple game-breaking bugs. And I mean game breaking. I don't take this stuff lightly. About 15% of the quests I played were bugged to some extent, some of them were literally unfinishable.  When I played DOS1, I kind of got the picture that Larian knew what they were doing but were being intentionally transgressive for the sake of being different. Now that I've finished DOS2 I see things in a different light. It really does feel like they just...winged the entire game, and it almost worked. I admire their ...luck? "
Zelloxy,812,20,4,"October 28, 2017",Not Recommended,19.2,"I loved the first game. And I want to love this game as well, but I just can't. I can't even get myself to finish the game - it now lays on the shelf so to speak. The new concept around physical and magical armor just ruined it for me completely. This is a RPG game, that comes from board games where dices are the main component. But here, due to the fact of armor, NOTHING is random. 0% change to inflict CC when armor is up, when it's down 100%. This has gotten me to stop playing."
skullplace,338,69,3,"October 8, 2017",Not Recommended,64.7,"The story and mood of the game, while a step up from the first, quickly starts to fall apart the further you get into it. The disjointed nature of the story really hurts the game, despite having such a strong start with Fort Joy, which was easily ten times better than Cyseal (though it lacked the same charm). The dual dialogue system being gone also means that co-op interractions have a lot less weight to them; similarly, origin characters don't really have interactions with each other, which really brings the experience down at times. The disjointed story becomes especially apparent after Fort Joy. It's revealed the player character is a Godwoken, and depending on your race, you represent your God and must become Divine. The Gods push the whole ""war against the other gods/races"" thing a lot, but when the time comes around where its every man for himself, its quickly resolved by the the antagonist, Dallis, and now our Gods just hate us in general and its no longer a plot point that matters. Even the endings of the game are all a let down, with the outcomes being very general... you could honestly compare it to the Mass Effect 3 endings.  The biggest problem with this game is that combat scenarios are far too similar to one another, thanks to the armor system. Unlike the first game, crowd control and status effects must first go through physical or magic armor, or else they are completely resisted by the target. While, in the beginning, it seemed like a nice solution to fix the problem the first game had, where you could CC targets one after the other and just wail on them for free, the armor system REALLY hurts the point of elemental surfaces and the like. Outside of Fort Joy, I found no use for them; everything just had too much armor for anything to work. Your strongest abilities were the only thing that did much of anything, and if you were a magic user, using a staff for damage was awful as wands were a lot stronger.  Skills, stats and talents are all pretty homogenized in the game. Strength, finesse, and intelligence are all ""more damage"". Memory gives you more slots for more abilities, and wits gives you more crit chance and lets you detect treasures (you can supplement this for a wits potion or the clear minded ability, since the amount of wits you need to detect stuff is pretty low). For melee builds, Necromancer is almost a must, because the health returns and utility of many necromancer abilities are irreplacable. For any character, though, being a hybrid (unless you are just a full mage) is a must because many abilities in each magic tree do not rely on intelligence to be useful. It lets your characters have much more access to abilities outside of Warfare, Scoundrel, and Huntsman, but some just aren't good or don't really add much in the way of variety, except for Necromancer. Civil abilities vary in their usefulness, but one that I found particularly vexing was persuasion. Sometimes, you can't really control who an NPC talks to during certain events, and if you lack persuasion, you may end up missing out on certain events. Some dialogues have stat checks, but they still require persuasion to do anything. I suppose I was expecting it to be like an Obsidian RPG in that regard.  Overall, I think Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a step back to a degree. I don't neccessarily not recommend it (but I can't write a mixed review yet...) but I really feel like its lacking in a lot of areas. The story can't be helped, though its still better than the first game, but a lot of this stuff could probably be fixed in an inevitable Enhanced Edition, which I feel like this game sorely needs. Its still a game worth its asking price, and if you are looking for a good co-op RPG, this is the best one out right now."
Brainwave,173,132,16,February 24,Not Recommended,86.6,"I really wish that Steam allowed us to rate games on a 1-10 scale rather than a pure thumbs up, thumbs down rating. I spent a lot of hours on this game, but I didn't finish it.  To me that's the ultimate cut off, if I grow tired of a game before actually completing it, I'm giving it a thumbs down.  I enjoyed Divinity 1 (and played the original Divine Divinity) so expected to like this game.  There were some improvements over Divinity 1.  The inventory system is more streamlined, you can look at all of your character's inventories in one big screen instead of having to swap between characters.  In addition, you can use an item or equip an item with any character from any inventory.  I also somewhat liked the storylines of the pregenerated characters better than in Divinity 1.  But honestly, other than that, I liked the first game much better.  Both games have an issue (at least this is a problem for me - others might not be bothered as much by it) that if you go the ""wrong direction"" you end up facing enemies that are too hard.  In several areas you end up having to test out different battles to see if they are doable at your level.  I have mixed feelings about this - it makes levelling feel meaningful but something like this feels more in line with a dark souls game than more of a standard RPG.  I don't particularly enjoy having to go back and see if I can do a fight yet 3 or 4 different times as I level up.  But as to specifics about Divinity 2 - to touch on my last point, the areas felt really unbalanced.  As I mentioned already, you have to test out battles in some areas to see if you can do them yet,  In others, not so much.  For example, Act II for me was a constant situation of trying to find the one area I could actually make progress on, since everything else was too hard.  Then Act III wasn't a problem at all, I never ran into a fight I couldn't handle.  Then Act IV (and this is the point that I just lost interest) there's a part where you get ambushed in several different spots by monsters that are higher level than my level as well as the level of everything else in the area.  Keep in mind I'd been attempting to complete every quest along the way, so I should have been at least close to the highest level I could have been at by that point.  I was also playing on normal difficulty and have a lot of experience playing these kinds of games (I know how to use terrain, split party, etc..).  I also disliked the change in how skills work from Divinity 1 to Divinity 2.  Divinity 1 had a Novice/Adept/Master system for learning skills.  Once raised your skill level to a certain point you could learn a certain amount of skills from each tier.  The higher level skills also had level reqs and had long cooldowns.  Divinity 2 changes all of that.  Instead it uses source points which are kind of like non regenerating mana points.  Starting with the mid level skills, all of the powerful skills require source points to cast, some as many as 3 points.  From a RPG standpoint that does make sense that as a Sourcerer you would need Source points to cast skills - however as a game mechanic I found it to be really annoying.  After each combat you basically have to either travel back to a place where you can refill Source, or cast a spell multiple times with each character out of combat to regain these points so that you can keep using these skills.  *And* in many cases these are the exact same skills (Arrow Spray for example) from Divinity 1 that didn't require Source then and in fact were used by your characters in that game who were Source HUNTERS - so after even a bit of thought, the whole concept that they are Sourcerer skills kind of falls apart.  The Divinity games utilize elemental combinations to create effects (fire, freezing, electricity, etc..) in combat.  Divinity 1 did a good job of this but this is another area in which Divinity 2 changed things for the worse in my opinion.  Div 1 had a good amount of abilities that caused elemental effects but it wasn't everything and it was relatively controllable.  Div 2 has so much that quite literally after almost every combat the entire area is just a giant lake of cursed fire.  It's not so much that this is deadly it's just not as clean of a system as in 1 where you could set certain areas on fire in a more controlled way.  In that game for example, you could create an area where enemies would have to cross that would quite often significantly damage them before they got to you.  This game, perhaps because it's so easy to just set everything on fire, the actual fire damage doesn't really feel significant and really makes the whole thing kind of pointless.  This game also introduces Magical and Physical Armor to the health system.  Basically each character and enemy has a certain amount of Magical and/or Physical armor.  Most attacks are considered one or the other type and will hit that type of armor first before they will damage the health of the target.  There are two reasons why I found this system to really not be an improvement.  First, a standard party will have a mix of damage.  I had a tank/melee fighter, a ranger and 2 wizards.  The wizards did almost exclusively magic damage and the other 2 did almost exclusively physical damage.  Most enemies have both physical and magical armor.  This creates a situation where you are almost always having to knock out *both* types of armor on enemies, or you have to split your damage to 2 different enemies which means you can't focus down anyone very fast.  In addition to this, almost all secondary effects (knockdown, stun, charm. etc..) don't work at all until you've broken through the type of armor that blocks them.  This made those effects much less useful than in Divinity 1 where you could immediately crowd control someone in a tough battle.  In Divinity 2 since you have to break through the armor first, by the point where you could CC someone, it's often almost as easy to just finish them off.  Making that whole aspect of combat (which was a big part of the first game) much less useful.  In the end, I got tired of continually having to reload because I stumbled upon something thrown in my path that was too hard, bored by the inability to use skills without having to constantly refill my source points and just lost interest overall.  I'm sure plenty of other people who aren't bothered as much by these mechanics would enjoy this game, but it wasn't for me.  "
Gabriot,347,41,4,"October 15, 2017",Not Recommended,88.8,"Until they fix the glaring bugs I can't in good faith recommend this game that seems to be getting unanimous positivte reviews.  So many times quests will just not finish even though you fulfilled all the requirements.  You know what's absolutely not fun in a game?  Wandering around forever trying to figure out why the hell a quest isn't completing, wondering what kind of obscure thing you might have missed, only to google it and see that it should be completing but isn't.  Personally, I HATE having to constantly google things in a game just to make sure I'm not missing something, and 90% of the time it just turns out the game wasn't QA'd properly and glaring bugs are why you can't finish a quest.  Really instills my confidence and makes me feel real immersed in the role-playing game.

Constantly having quicksave before literally every interaction in the game is NOT FUN.  But if you don't, what's even less fun is backtracking over parts of the game just because of some bullcrap glitchy behavior.  In battle it's mind numbingly infuriating as well.  So many times I will be trying to click attack on someone, and the dude will just run to the side of them and waste their action points doing a pointless move that turn into an attack of opportunity instead of you know, just attacking the ♥♥♥♥ing person directly in front of them.  Also a lot of skills are just HORRIBLE with how the UI handles it.  How many ♥♥♥♥ing times do I need to click an arrow in my hot bar before you freaking register it for me to fire?  Or how many times do I need to click drink a consumable to ♥♥♥♥ing consume it?  Spoiler alert it's a completely random amount of times each time because somehow the UI is so buggy in this game that it ends up boiling down to rng to get your clicks to even register.  And there's also a ton of annoying things that just blow my mind.  The pathing in this game is a joke, try moving your party through an area with a lot of environmental hazards and tell me it went smoothly.  Then I can call you a blatent liar.  You're constantly getting story events triggered to the wrong character, usually never the person you want talking to the particular character to pass a persuasion attempt.  There's also other crap like randomly just losing items after cutscenes and not realizing till way too many saves later, and I could keep going on yada yada but I'm sure all the fanboys will defend this game to the death as being the most perfect game ever built event though it's impossible to go 5 minutes in the game without experience some sort of inconvenience due to bugs.  It would be a good game without the bugs and honestly I'll probably just suffer through it anyway because no one makes any good games these days and this is what I'm left with.  Yay."
Broseidon,728,99,2,"September 27, 2017",Not Recommended,88.1,"I honestly cannot believe that I'm writing a negative review, yet here I am. The first two acts are incredible, beautifully polished and complete. The third act starts to get a bit weak, having a tendency towards very specific paths to continue, unlike the previous acts which give immense freedom in how you play and your choices mattering. The fourth act is nothing short of a trainwreck, critical pieces of information being easily missed (a book lying on a table in a completely optional area) and in one case, spoiling parts of the plot itself by giving me incorrect journal entries.  Ultimately, if you can put aside the huge drop in quality as the game progresses, it nets to be a fantastic game, unfortunately, I'm not one of those people. The later acts were nothing but pure frustration for me, and by the time I had finally finished, I had forgotten about the fun that I actually did have in the previous acts.  In short, since there isn't a mixed option, I have to recommend against it, but if you can get over the quality drop, it's well worth the price, otherwise wait until a sale."
Seresu,381,83,4,"September 26, 2017",Not Recommended,450.7,"Although I've been having a decent amount of fun with this game, I can't recommend it based on it still being incomplete. There's still far too many bugs in the quest system. In most games, completing an objective that is part of a quest you have not unlocked yet is not an issue. Once you accept the quest, it recognizes your current progress and incorporates it. In DoS 2, doing this is likely to permanantly break the relevant quests. What's more, these broken quests will auto-complete at the end of the current act with negative completion entries. It's entirely possible to save someone, only to complete an act and have your journal claim you abandoned them to their fate.  There are minor mechanical issues still existing as well. Barrels exploding fluids onto surfaces two floors above them, enemies healing from elements with 50% resistance, quests that require teleportation not accounting for retribution damage, an infinite ashen idol of rebirth bug that leaves your character permanantly unable to leave combat..  To top it off, the only bug Larian has recognized so far is an infinite damage loop. Despite sending in several reports that would ""be replied to within one business day"" I've now gone a week without a single piece of acknowledgement of the slew of quest related issues I'm experiencing.  TL;DR wait for them to fully finish the quest system, at least. So much outside the main line is in near shambles right now. The game is still fun, but you'll be constantly frustrated by impossible quests and a tarnished log."
Grumpy Old Dwarf,547,22,1,"November 18, 2017",Not Recommended,186.1,"Loved the first one to bits, was so hyped for the sequel, didn't get into the early access as I didn't want to spoil the pleasure but bought the game soon after the official release. Played it with my gf via split-screen coop. The experience can be summed up with one word - a chore.   Pros: - The narrator is awesome. - The voice acting is decent, some characters are excellent.  - Some dialogues are smart and funny, mostly pet-pal related stuff.  - It's got dwarves in it. - The co-op component is implemented in a very intuitive, user friendly way.  - The music is better than in the first game. - IT'S GOT DWARVES IN IT! Other games take example.  - Character progression and itemization are OK. - The game comes packed with various roleplaying options and features. - The storyline is quite open, there is no good guys vs bad guys, it's not clear whether we (as a party) should be doing the things that we're doing. It's all grey area, sacrifice for the greater good sort of story but it's always up to the player to draw the line.  - The journal is a nice touch, way better than your usual quest tracker, unfortunately navigating it with a controller is a chore. - The Game Master mode is pure gold.   Cons: - The main story is terrible. Seriously, the first one wasn't that strong either, but at least it didn't treat itself overly seriously. The sequel is cheesy and plain stupid, but it's oh so serious about the plot. It feels like a third-grade fan fiction, or a tabletop RP game run by a weak but overly ambitious 14yo GM. - The origin stories are weak, the characters in general are weak and not interesting. Couldn't care less. - The pace of the game is uneven, often times you will find yourself wondering what's next, where should I go or why am I here in the first place? Unfortunately the game is designed in such a way, that even 1 level makes all the difference in the world. So if you wonder off the road or arrive in a certain place too early you will run into some tough, unfair fights. This was similar in the first game, but in the first game you could handle some tougher enemies by being creative and careful. Here's not the case due to terrible encounter design, shallow tactics and linear flow of combat. More below. - The combat, the highlight of the title, the thing that kept me playing through the first game, is utterly boring. The encounter design is terrible. I loved the fights in the first one, the planning, the strategies, the enemies. Here 99% encounters feel like trash fights - all are virtually the same. Every enemy can fly, cast spells, teleport, shoot, heal etc. Usually your party gets ambushed with enemies popping out of the thin air. There's no preparation, no scouting, no positioning. CC, spell combos, buffs, debuffs, positioning etc all are next to useless - raw physical damage is the way to go most of the time. Boring.  - Some encounters are just plain stupid. Do not confuse stupid with difficult. The first game had some very difficult yet enjoyable and rewarding fights. Here it's just not fun, the enemies cheat all the time, the game can instakill you on random, the fights are long and tedious, sometimes there's a key component to a fight and if you don't know it you are bound to lose.  - You either fight a long, unfair, mostly boring battle you are very likely to lose, or... you can easily cheese the crap out of most encounters. Lame design.  - The bloody necrofire, seriously, it's ugly, it's overused, it's annoying, it's hard to see or select anything, yet it's up 80% fights. - The game is riddled with bugs, nothing major so far (mainly UI and controller related stuff), but the little buggers take out another chip of enjoyment from this game. It's been in development for so long it's unacceptable.  - The UI for the gamepad is cumbersome, way too big. Cannot be scaled down.  - Loading screens are waaaaaay to long.   The first game was lighthearted and fun, the combat system was excellent, the encounters were very well designed and interesting. The sequel is a bloated mess, the story is overly serious yet very silly and childish, the combat system offers less variety, feels slower and unbalanced, the combat encounters feel uninspired, repetitive and boring. Beware of bugs. Been waiting for this game a long time but I sincerely regret spending money on it. It's big, it looks good, all the components look good on paper but it's just not fun to play. Going through the main story is a chore. Reading the dialogue is a chore. Fighting your way through boring fights is a chore. Exploring the world is a chore. There is a good game somewhere underneath, I guess some people will like it as it is. I didn't.  Verdict: A chore.  4/10  The only good additions are the narrator, the dwarves and the GM mode."
BinaryCat,240,9,0,May 9,Not Recommended,16.8,"It's like being in a tabletop game run by a GM who is *way* more interested in his own NPCs than anything the player does. And my god, those NPCs.  In addition to having the game's premades shoved into your face, as party members there are no less than three snooty, arrogant noble types (out of the five or six party members I've come across). Even the others started grating on me.  There's a massive mechanics/story disconnect with the party members, as well. Each one comes with their own well-traveled backstory. It's an RPG, so that's par for the course. But don't tell me this 10,000 year old sorcerer will gladly start picking locks if I ask him nicely when we meet. If you're so proud of your characters, game, at least have the confidence to give them a defined skillset.  And as an aside, the game made a huge deal about me starting as undead, and that it would be a more difficult experience. Apparently, that means 'always wearing a hat.' The fact that every potential party member was 100% cool with it from the word go also robbed it of any story impact it might have had.  Ultimately, I play RPGs for interesting characters and story. The story didn't grip me, and the characters, well...  Combat was okay."
Voile,169,63,0,"October 4, 2017",Not Recommended,91.6,"In short: wait to buy the game until several patches from now. Maybe six months. Maybe until an enhanced edition comes out.   In long: If you played the first game, this one is a bit of a disappointment. There were some questionable gameplay design changes. The institution of the armour system is not ideal, to say the least, and the streamlining of the stat system loses more than it makes up in ease of use. I think other people have explained it better than I can, so I'll sum it up: physical/magical armour prevents any damage or status effects, from any source, be it directly applied or environmental. Defence abilities such as willpower that would protect against certain types of status afflictions from the last game have been removed. Certain attribute stats, such as speed, have also been removed. The dynamic action point system of the last game has been removed. Skills from the last game, copy+pasted in description and effect, suddenly have a higher cost requirement (that enemy NPCs often don't have to pay.)  All of these changes have the sum of making the combat much more constricted and much less dynamic, and many times, means one fight to another is virtually identical. I personally wouldn't consider that to be a positive nor negative, if not for one thing: enemies have none of the same restrictions as you. Enemies lack cooldowns and have universal access to skills you don't. Enemies can create surfaces and status afflictions (like cursed surfaces, acid, plague) that entirely ignore your armour. Enemies have more action points than you, and they have a higher max action point threshold. Every enemy has a teleport ability, some can use every turn, AND they have a farther range than you, so some fights consist of using all your action points to run up to an enemy, only for them to teleport/run farther away than you can run, then casting something at you. Enemies have a large amount of free movement, and many skills cost less AP for them alone. In most fights, enemies start in the most advantageous positions possible, if you're trying to do the quests in the order they're intended to be done. Oh, also, all enemies are psychic on every difficulty level. If you're an undead, even if you're hiding your identity, expect to be healed, which will do a good amount of damage to you. If someone uses the permafrost skill, which makes you immune to damage (except when it doesn't, because some enemies can still damage you with certain skills, which isn't mentioned in the skill description,) and heals you for any damage taken, all enemies will ignore the character with the permafrost effect. If a character has a higher weakness to a certain damage type than another, all enemies will focus on that damage type. Expect to say, several times, ""That's cheating!""  I don't mean to say the game is hard. It's not, really, which is fine by my standards. But these systems have not been studied, and so it's glaring and annoying when unintended consequences happen. One such unintended consequence: only one or two skill trees are valid above certain thresholds, IF, and I mean if, bugs haven't severely limited their usefulness. The way the system is designed, all magic damage, as it is elemental, stands a chance of healing the enemy, and as physical/magical armour is divided, an effective team should use one and not the other to avoid chipping away at two different healthpools with no overlap. Physical damage cannot be resisted nor healed. Melee characters must spend valuable action points to get into melee, and all enemies are equipped with a cooldown-less teleport, so this is inefficient. The inequality between different skill trees and builds becomes unavoidable and especially annoying end game.  I'm also not a big fan of the borderlands-esque entirely randomised, no exceptions loot system. In an RPG, if my character is given a weapon that is supposedly designed to kill a god, I'd expect it to not be a sidegrade for this pitchfork I found in a lucky wooden box a few minutes ago. I get testy when all my strength-based gear gives me intelligence points.  Oof. End game. Let's jump there. I'm not wholly sure the developers fully beta tested or bug fixed the entire second half of the game, if they did at all. Certain higher level skills literally, literally do not work; netherswap, one of the rare teleports in the game, generates line of sight errors no matter what. No matter what. You cannot use the skill at the moment of writing this because no matter where or what you're teleporting, you can't see it. My character with netherswap, apparently, couldn't see herself to teleport herself.  Okay, so that's combat gameplay. It doesn't end there. Certain quests cannot start, nor finish, depending on the order of your dialogue choices. I do not mean ""I'll gouge your eyes out"" dialogue choices. A quest in the last zone doesn't start if you ask a woman if she's doing ok before you ask about her missing husband. Another quest in the last zone doesn't start if you happened to read a certain book before talking to a quest relevant NPC. You'd think your character might care to mention, perhaps, this NPC is about to be murdered by this other NPC. No such luck.   Bigger bugs are still in the game, too. Certain circumstances can suddenly make your characters unable to interact with objects or talk to NPCs. Essential NPCs will disappear entirely from your map. Saves still get permanently corrupted. Unintentionally unkillable enemy mobs. Don't play multiplayer: more bugs.  Back to quests- your journal often doesn't update with recent quest progress, or it updates inaccurately, saying you did things you didn't, or didn't do things you did. At one point my quest told me my romantically entangled companion betrayed me and tried to end the world. Bit of a mixup, that. Even NPCs get confused and will talk to you as if you picked options you did not. This gets bothersome when the NPCs are so enraged by the actions you didn't take that they try to kill you.  Many quests will never close or resolve unless you kill one of the quest essential characters, thus never giving you a reward. God forbid you move onto the next area, because that will close your quest and then will say you ignored it/abandoned it and assume you did the worst things possible.  Actually, I don't know what's worse. When leaving resolves the quest negatively, or when the quest never resolves, staying open and unresolved through the literal epilogue. I had two quests from act 2 do that.   Even if the combat design stayed true to the first game, and the bugs got swept up, if you enjoyed the RPG elements of the first game, you're going to be a bit disappointed in DOS2. Many quests give no choices, though imply there should be more than one, and if you choose to follow the quest, you'll find NPCs become furious with you for being forced to pick the only resolution available. The main quest mandates a course of action in the first act that will immediately make half of the NPCs on the map hostile on sight to you. The main quest often mandates, then makes unavoidable, incredibly unethical or stupid mechanics/decision chains that will prevent progress if you refuse. You're going to be eating people's souls and consigning them to oblivion whether you want to or not, bub. You were a FOOL for not seeing the big bad's super evil ambush, and you were a FOOL for doing nothing even if you saw it a mile away, because they somehow got into an area they couldn't have gotten into, and suddenly you're knocked down and immobilised and the big bad got away, you idiot.  NPCs will gank-dialogue characters at random. Hope you didn't invest in persuasion on your main character.  I still had fun. Just too much annoyance, for a 45 USD game."
Naharri,136,14,0,May 22,Not Recommended,158.8,"So far, this game has two modes for me.  Absolutely amazing, and utter disaster. For the section of the game, I found that approaches to quests and combat to be interested and quite varried.  I could fight or talk my way out of most encounters or approach a with a different tactic if I lost the first time.  Most quests offered many different ways to complete their object.  For example, the first Major quest is escaping from the ""bad guys,"" and I can think of at least 5 different ways to do so. Combat was similiar, only in two or three fights did I have to start the fight over to change my positioning or spells/equipment to beat the monster.  However, this all changed when i got to the second area of the game.  So many times i have to restart fights to preposition characters or switch gear/spells just so that i can beat the encounter.  Many quests started having only one or two options, many times being fight or pass the skill check, which seems to stem from 1 talent, regardless of which skill is being utilized.  Most monsters hit for double the damage my characters do at the same level, which wouldn't be much of an issue, if they didn't already have more health, armor, magic armor, and seemingly more action points than my own.    While I did enjoy the beginning of this game, it quickly devolved into a gear/level check that unless i constantly reoutfitted every character ever level or two, at no small cost of gold and time (and a hint of luck that vendors had what i needed), being taken out of the immersion by having to exploit knowledge of fights that were coming up, or reloading multiple times to reposition characters to fight the ambush and not have everyone crowd controlled on the first turn.    While it started Very interesting and full of choice, this game quickly fell into frustation of reloading and prepositioning for most fights that might have been difficult or facerolling over those that weren't.  Add into the mix having to utilize specific methods of fighting or cheesing fights just got old quickly."
perochialjoe,454,274,17,"December 2, 2017",Not Recommended,63.0,"Divinity 2 is definitely a game that can hold your attention for a while and you would probably really like it if you haven't played the first Original Sin. The problem for me, though, is that this game feels like a downgrade in nearly every respect from the first. The story isn't as interesting, the locations feel really bland (comparatively), combat is slower and worst of all the party interaction is simplistic at best.   One of the best things about Original Sin was that you and your partner built a relationship and history together as the game went on. You had arguments about what to do in a quest and could discuss the outcomes afterwards. Over time you began to develop your own tropes. It wasn't perfect by any means, but it was far better than what you get with Original Sin 2. This game allows for 4 player co-op, which is awesome. I was really excited when I heard the announcement about that. The problem is, however, that they really had to sacrifice a lot for characterization to accomidate that. All the pre-made characters have their own quest lines and stories, sure. But you have essentially no influence on the character, your dialogues feel meaningless and what you do in a quest is entirely your own decision. There are no group decisions. It's every man for himself, which leads me to the biggest problem.  As I said before Original Sin had you both discuss quest paths and if there was a disagreement, you would do a paper rock scissors minigame to decide who won. Nothing ground breaking, but it worked. Your two characters were partners and worked together for a common goal. It was kind of campy at times, but it made for a really fun and light hearted setting. Enter Original Sin 2. Not only does it not encourage working together, it in fact encourages the opposite. There are options that will only benefit one person. There are plot points that flat out tell you, ""Only one person can win."" It sets you against one another from the beginning. It might be interesting for some people, but I personally hated it. Coming from Original Sin where I loved the cooperative element, I hated that the game actively encouraged people to put themselves first. It might sound interesting at first, but I guarantee it really sucks to have to play a RPG where people start ignoring the story so that they can loot everything in sight before others get there first.  The tone of Original Sin 2 is much different from Original Sin. In fact, the exact opposite. Original Sin had a pretty light hearted campy feel to it. Pretty much every option felt like it had a good enough outcome if you put in the effort to get it. Original Sin 2, however, is a bleak and depressing setting. The people in the world are generally terrible and there are very few happy moments ever available. There are many quest lines that actually just turn a sad situation worse even if you go through all the effort to finish everything. The story feels completely hopeless and it eventually had me choosing to do as little as possible for questing.  As for the combat, they made magic a bit more accessible to people. There are more schools of magic and more abilities for you to choose from. It's interesting enough. But once again they made it worse, I think, from Original Sin. They basically halved your action points (AP) in this game. So you have less moves available in a turn. Then they added two types of defense. Physical and Magic. In order to do health damage, you have to bring one defense down to 0 and then hit with an attack of that damage type. So if you want to kill somebody with a sword, you have to get their physical armor to 0 and then hit them. Or if you want to kill somebody with a fireball, you have to get their magical armor to 0 and then hit them. All of this is done so that certain status ailments cannot be applied while certain armors are up. For instance, burning will first reduce magic armor before it takes health away. Same with stunning and knockdown. All this does is make combat feel like a chore. Before you can do anything to hurt anybody, you have to get their defenses down. But your moves are severely limited so you can maybe attack twice if you stand completely still and have max AP. It's slow and much less fun.  Most of this review was comparing Original Sin 2 to Original Sin and saying 'the first one was better.' And I think it was. If you haven't played Original Sin then you will probably really enjoy Original Sin 2. But for me Original Sin 2 was a huge letdown compared to the first. This is a good game but it's a big step back. I love this studio and I really, really hope to see an Original Sin 3 or some other CRPG from them in the future. With the success of Original Sin 2, I'm sure we will. I just hope they manage to bring back all the good they did with the first Divinity Original Sin."
Vancrist,143,40,6,May 14,Not Recommended,117.4,"I'm going to start with the positive. Character creation is awesome and fun. Character progression is awesome and fun. Being able to return to your 'base' and respec is super cool incase you get bored and just don't like the direction you went in several levels ago.   Now for the bad   The first 1/4 of this game is super fun. I loved it. I thought it was awesome.....then I got to act two. It starts going down hill there...by act three its starting to go down hill faster and faster....act four it just crashes into the ground and burrows in deep. The farther you get in the game it seems like the less the devs actually tried. The story is interesting but also convuluted and can be at times kinda hard to follow. There are several factions and you have a very goldfish like relationship with them that doesn't make sense. One moment a faction is trying to turn you into a mindless zombie and the next moment...you are...doing quest....for them....becasue they are good now?  The combat becomes a mess. The way the system works is that you have physical armor and magical armor. CC abilities have absolutely no effect unless the armor type they coorispond to is depleted form your target. This isn't a problem early game when targets don't have that much armor but late mid game to late game....don't plan on using CC any time soon...unless that CC is provoke which is devestating when your enemies use it but worthless when you use it. Let me explain:  So provoke is an AOE that works even if the targets of it are full armor. When you use this on enemies most of the time they were just auto attack the person who uses it. When the enemies use it on you, however, all of your characters will blow all your important cooldowns, use all your limited resources, and waste all your consumables. All those super hard to make/get potions you were saving? they will just start spam drinking them like they were water. That ability that refreshes your cooldowns at the cost of source? (source being a limited resource for casting certain spells). Welp, you just used it even though its round 1 and you have nothing on cooldown....killer.  Charm is also another absolutely worthless effect when you use it but super devestating effect when the enemy uses it. The spell charm is worthless because it costs so many actions a turn to use and at best the enemy will auto attack ONCE and then pass turn. At worse the enemy will just reposition themselves so when the charm wears off they have a prime spot for destroying you. When you get charmed, however, prepare to watch your characters blow all your cooldowns and go balls to the wall on your teammates with no restraint. Its just not fun. Its not fun at all.  So initiative is based off your initiative score and your wits stat. Loading points into wits I could still never get first go in any fight. At least 1 (most of the time 2) enemies always went before me and since the game always makes you group up in a tight square at the start of every fight that is enough for those enemies to just unload AOEs on your entire party and leave you nearly dead if not dead. NPCs will always also have more action points than you. I've counted spells and checked AP costs and yea, most of them start fights with 6 AP which is 2 more than you which is a whole nother spell most of the time. Being how most of the time the enemies will out number you by at least 1 if not 2 (in some cases much more) this makes fights nerve wracking messes.   The final boss fight in this game is a trainwreck. I can't go into detail about how screwed up it is because its just that screwed up. Again, outnumbered by NPCs that are stronger than you and have initiative over you even though you are the one who starts the fight. Its actually two fights in one and it goes immediately into the second fight after the first fight so any downed party members are gone and health totals/armor totals remain what they were before but its a new fight so of course the enemy gets initative over you to spam AOE on you in this barely living state.....there are also other problems with this fight that I won't go into because they spoil story things but needless to say...its not fun.  A lot of the quests just end. A lot of them are very buggy and end without telling you they are over so they are in your log indefinately. Some of them end bcause you did something that failed the quest HOWEVER the game doesn't tell you that you failed....they just remain in your log unfinished. A lot of the quests just have no direction and you are are supposed to make leaps in logic that are just nonsensical unless you read it from an online guide. The farther you get in the game the worse this problem becomes. By act 4 just don't bother with the quests because they are just aweful messes.   Crafting.....is aweful in this game. Complete crap. Its like they started it, got about 30% of it done, then called it a day. The only thing you will ever really craft are potions, arrows, runes. I mean, you might craft food to to an extent, the grenades really aren't worth making, weapons and armor you can craft are jokes and not funny ones. You can craft spell books but chances are it would just be less of a head ache to buy them most of the time. Most of the stuff you'll be crafting you'll be looking up the recepies online for them because chances are you won't find them in game or at least not before they become to weak to bother with. Its just frustrating.   Gear: This is another big point. The loot you get seems to just suck more and more the farther in the game you get. What ever random system generates what stats gear have is dumb. Most of the time you get combinations that just don't really benefit anyone. about 95% of the loot drops i got were so so for 2-3 of the people in my party but not exactly great for any of them. Like, when it comes to magic certain schools compliment each other and certain schools kinda contrast. Water and air go together well because water leaves pools and puddles behind and lightning from air can apply shock through the puddles. Earth and fire work out because earth tends to leave behind oil or poison which is combustable when you mix it with fire. So its head scratching that most of the items you get are something like ""This armor require a high finesse score to wear (not int which is what mages mostly build) but doesn't have any scoundrel like boons on it...insteal it gives you plusses to opposing magic schools like +2 to air and +2 to earth.....because those stats just work out so well with each other. Now I know with the customizable options you can very easily have a character with points in all of these for one reason or another but they wouldn't be your main focus nor what you would want on their gear. And even when you get to level 21 the game will still insist on giving you crappy level 16-18 gear that just makes you sigh and shake your head.  The worse part about all of this is that at the end of the game it just seems so small and empty.  The first two acts do take some time to get through but the third and fourth act are probably shorter than the first act even when you combine the two. The game just gets weaker and weaker and weaker which is unfortunate. There is also a finite amount of xp you can ultimately get. Once you clear out an area its cleared out for good. I guess that is fine but ultimately it makes the fights limited and such which may not have been a bad thing being how the combat system gets worse the farther in the game you go.   I have started a new game several times to try out different combinations. I find myself getting past the first act though and then I just stop caring after that. I know that its just downhill from there."
Bellyache,38,35,1,"September 27, 2017",Not Recommended,52.6,"There's not much on the market for co-op, turn-based games. This game is much more fun with a friend, but it is wrought with bugs and poor design decisions. I am playing on tactician mode.  For one, being on high ground is advantageous, but enemies seem to be able to melee strike you despite being 15 feet below you.   Secondly, it seems like every single enemy type has some sort of teleport, jump, strong melee attack, and a ranged attack. So every fight is the same (minus differing terrains). You can get to high ground but everything can reach you and hit you without much trouble. There are crocodiles that throw magical boulders and dogs that shoot bolts from back-mounted crossbows. Every humanoid seems to have the polymorph flying ability. Making all enemy types essentially the same doesn't make the game ""hard,"" it just makes it stupid. How can I employ strategy when everything can fly and shoot me from wherever they are?  Third, line-of-sight seems to be screwy. Many times, I will be on high ground with no line-of-sight on something below, and yet that something can still shoot me in the face with arrows.   Fourth, the physical and magic armor system make it impossible to crowd control off the bat. Everything needs to be damaged first. It blows that my partner does physical damage and I do magical damage... it's like whittling away at two different health bars for the same monster.  Several other issues, but these are the most glaring ones. I would wait until this game gets some more patches in before shelling out forty some dollars for it."
Black Hammer,806,225,11,"September 18, 2017",Not Recommended,55.8,"Really disappointed with the game. It does a lot of things well, but falls flat on its face in two categories.  Encounter Design and writing.  As someone who has played, run, and occasionally written RPGs, D:OS 2 feels amateurish when it comes to both those things. The encounter feels extremely samey, with nearly all enemies functioning the same. Almost every enemy's kit follows a checklist of AoE status effect, teleport, and heal. Their AI consists of picking a target, then dogpiling that target regardless of positioning or self preservation. Enemies will walk through fire, burn themselves down to 1HP, and be set to die next turn just to get in one more hit on target prime. Heck, they'll stand around without attacking or just spend all their AP moving if they can't attack said target. They ignore Oppotunity Attacks and Taunt effects, so the only way to prevent this is to kill or stun them.  Doesn't help that most fights take place in the same sort of unfriendly terrain. Enemies get high ground, player gets hazards. Enemies get to magically appear from nowhere in flanking positions, player gets deployed in a clump regardless of formation settings.  Enemy damage scales extremely quickly, but since they don't actually have gear, the player doesn't benefit from this. Pickpocket an archer NPC before a fight, and you find three gold and an empty bottle. During the fight, he will merrily pop multiple consumables, like explosive arrows or healing potions. He didn't have these before the fight, and if you kill him before he would have a chance to use them, he wouldn't drop them, either. Same for gear. The enemy archer will have better armor than your tank, and do more damage with his bow, but someone on death all his equipment vanishes into the ether.  Or occasionally you'll get a pair of common quality gloves two levels behind, which he clearly wasn't wearing since they would never get his armor that high.  The story of the game is stock for the Divinity series, which to be fair has always embraced the PC as special snowflake story trope. The character dialogue is iffy, but the plot frequently feels forced or out of touch with the situation.  Kill a named NPC, said NPC returns in the next scene. If you let me burn someone to a charred corpse on screen, then animate a disgusting blob zombie with his corpse, that character should probably not pop up again.  Overall, the game frequently feels like it was set up by a new or just plain bad GM. ""These are my favorite NPCs, you can't kill them. I put them in fights, but they magically survive or escape. No, you can't loot or use their equipment, because I don't want you to look as cool as them. Haha, look how dumb you are, being ambushed by invisible enemies I made magically appear even though you were standing where they were a minute ago."" Most of the game's challenge comes from this, rather than any real feel of difficulty.   Few additional weird design choices: Initiative is I go-you go, meaning boosting initiative is meaningless, since you will always take turns with the enemy.  Status effects are blocked by armor/magic armor, meaning these have to be stripped before you can apply effects. This seems fair, until you realize enemies have more armor and do more damage than you. Meaning they can frequently fire off these abilities and land them on the first hit, while you have to spend a turn or two chewing down armor.  The armor mechanic also means you are best off focusing on one type of damage, preferably physical due to fewer resists. So in a game with six different kinds of spellcasting, one of the better teams is four 2h warriors bashing everything to death while spamming fly or teleport.  Many enemies have flat out immunities to certain effects, for no clear reason. (A clear reason is something like a fire elemental being resistant to burning.) There is no way to predict this, so you can go into a fight only to find the damage types and status effects your party is built for are worthless for a given encounter.  Graphics are nice. Gameplay has a lot of potential, but the encounter design lets it down. I'm in the 2nd act, and I'm sick of the fights. You get access to a wonderful variety of abilities, but you're best off running a party of all physical attackers and the odd utility spell.  I want to like it. I think a really good game could be made out of the foundation D:OS2 is built on, but so far, Larian hasn't done it.  On the bright side, it is way better than Dragon Commander was."

polk.scott,69,18,3,"October 13, 2017",Not Recommended,109.5,"I'm done. Fine, the game is hardcore, I get it. I spent a lot of time learning the system and after many hours and a restart, I developed a team I was comfortable with. Experience is hard to come by in this game and most of the game you feel underpowered. Most of the battles are ambushes with no way to study the fight and plan, i.e. stealth is worthless because you can't reconnoiter and then set up for the fight, a standard for turn based games like Baldur's Gate, etc.   I managed to stomach all this until stupid quest mechanics that fail for capricious and unknown reasons. I stated experience was hard to come by with little chance to gain from quests? One quest fails because the quest givers ""fled"". No indication was given that this was a time based quest, no indication that this was even a possiblity. So after a day of game time, I came back to the quest, completed all the tasks, go back to where the quest givers ""were"" and got a notice that they fled, quest over...no experience."
Aldourien,241,42,4,May 23,Not Recommended,43.5,"This game had potential in the beginning, but that potential quickly deteriorated with progression through this nightmare. I've played tabletop RPGs for 10 years and some CRPGs, such as Planescape: Torment, Neverwinter Nights 1 & 2, Ultima and Pillars of Eternity and the presentation of Divinity: Original Sin 2 had me interested.  Here's my take on this game.  Pros: + Pleasant artstyle and shaders. + Dialogue between playable characters themselves and NPCs are interesting and engaging. + Crisp sound-effects and battle animations. + Mix-&-match freely with abilities (not locked to starter class).  Cons: - Very unbalanced encounters. - Game mechanics forces you to stack one damage type and play heavily on meta-knowledge. - Resurrection is not possible without scrolls, no option to raise the dead after combat or by holy building in towns. - Teleportation skills sometimes breaks the game. - Loot is boring and uninspired. - Crafting is cluttered and needlessly obscuring.  Now into a bit of the nitty-gritty parts. The game has good visual quality, decent voice acting (with the exception of the created character's voices) and allows for varied characterisation with the mix-&-match style of abilities. These aspects combined makes for a more natural character progression and development as the story unfolds.  Later on, when combat becomes more of a focus, the problems are quickly apparent. I understand the idea behind having a physical armor pool and magical armor pool to block each type of damage/status effects. The inherent problem with this design is that it forces the player to put all damage into one type to overcome only one armor type. With some simple math many players, including me, have concluded that a full physical party is the dominant setup, leaving one member as a hybrid for times when enemies have no magical armor and can be slowed down with one spell. However, physical abilities are more reliable to disable and lockdown multiple enemies over magical abilities.  A downside of having a pure magic caster are surfaces, which is one of the selling points this game has. Yes, you can use wet surfaces to your advantage but that is a double-edged sword. Because this game's very heavy usage of reposition abilities, the crowd of enemies you want to affect with Shocking will most likely affect your party members too. This is because of the AI scripting which makes enemies dogpile onto your weakest character (this makes a tanking build virtually useless since enemies can simply teleport past your tank, making attacks of opportunity useless) and even run through Attacks of Opportunity or burning surfaces to secure a kill.  Every encounter fought will almost always start with your party bunched up and vulnerable to splash damage. If you try to split up your party you might find the other members being outside combat and ending up dead last in initiative when you walk them into the combat zone and all enemies are free to act first. You may find yourself wander into an empty valley when an encounter springs up and the enemy are already in perfect positions (split up on both sides and on top of high ground too high to teleport to from bottom level). While creatures with height advantage gains damage bonuses and vice versa, this causes a significant disadvantage which you constantly have to meta-game around by re-entering combat (fleeing or quick loading) and remember the enemy positioning so you can setup a counter.  Take all of this into account and one hard-counter strategy is nearly required and that is Teleportation or Nether Swap. These spells are not bound to the rules of armor and can be used on almost anyone, meaning you can pull a boss away from its minions and dogpile the boss before the minions catch up. You may also teleport ranged enemies down from their perches and hopefully manage to dogpile them before they teleport back up in sequence.  My final straw was when I entered an area at Level 10 where I needed a quest item. Taking this quest item and leaving meant a multitude of creatures (6 + 1 ""Elite"" version) appearing and acting almost immediately. We were of equal level, they had relatively low health, no physical armor nor magic armor and could be brought down with one Whirlwind of my Fighter. Taking that group down caused a duplicate group to appear on the opposite side of the room (contextually) and the Elite, which was left alive, cast a resurrection spell which brought all dead enemies back to 50% health and first in initiative order. They start with 5 action points (as they can move and attack twice) and deal about 170 damage per hit. Now we fight a group of 12 + 2 Elites and all of them act before my entire party and to make matters worse, there are a total creature count of 24 + 2 Elite in that same room.  Running this encounter in a D&D Challenge Rating calculator using 24 monsters CR 6 (as they are easier to kill) and 2 Elites CR 8 (one by itself poses not much of a threat) comes up to an encounter challenge rating of 30 (meaning your party need to be at level 30 for this battle to be at equal difficulty). Obviously these systems are very different in mechanics, but the encounter scaling works fairly similarly. This calculation discounts any abilities to resurrect creatures. This game is an unbalanced mess of 'you vs the system', with extensive need of immersion-breaking meta-knowledge to overcome its artificial difficulty.  All of these aspects creates an incredibly frustrating and unintuitive playing experience where you are required to:  Stack one damage type with multiple ranged characters.  Have multiple teleportation abilities (for yourself and enemies)  Constantly chase after enemies who teleport around to catch them.  Struggle against the unintuitive targeting system (I have missed attacks when the attack-line targeted the floor and not the enemy my cursor pointed at).  Fight a system which clearly is designed against you:  Enemies have consumables, but cannot be stolen nor looted if killed prior to using them.  Mindless creatures (zombies & constructs) intelligently navigates, with perfect calculation, where to walk through a sea of fire and survive with single digit hitpoints when it would otherwise kill them if they walked as expected.   Enemy ranged attackers have longer range than your characters on equal elevation.  Lack of spell restrictions. E.g. an enemy who can summon a creature, which can summon another creature, which can summon another creature, ad nauseam.   Enemy mass-resurrection spells places their revived creatures after the reviver in initiative. A trial & error mentality of encounter designs. (discover the encounter, lose from overwhelming odds and retry, specificly to counter the enemy setup).   Yes, I know games need to be challenging.  That being said, when you are required to stack certain abilities/playstyles and know what abilities and enemy placements are going to be, before engaging an encounter, to have a fighting chance.. You have failed as a dungeon master and a designer."

Tom Sawyer,496,104,8,May 14,Not Recommended,229.5,"Pros:+ Story is better than in 1 + Combat is mostly pleasant + Dialogues are voiced  Cons:- Bugs, bugs and more bugs - Multiplayer is an afterthought - Armor system - A certain patch practically ruined combat  In-depth:I want to say that I love this game, but it is a horrible, abusive, love-hate relationship. I'm very curious, how many people that leave positive reviews finished this game. Because the further you go, the worse it gets.  But let's start with the beginning. The first 1/4 of this game is amazing. It has huge variety in the ways you can do your quests, very few bugs, pretty good story all-around. This part of the game deserves all the praise Divinity gets. The next 1/2 of this game is... kinda meh. The worst part about it is the sheer amount of unfinished, unsatisfying side-quests. Quests that can be failed simply because there is no ""let's talk about it later"" option in the dialogue for you to think things through. Quests that fail without any warning if you go through other quests before finishing them. Plus, the sheer amount of crowd-control your enemies get at this point, combined with crappy loot you probably still have makes combat much less fun. And finally, the last 1/4 of this game is honestly just a buggy mess. Including the final battle, which is the most frustrating thing I've ever encountered in this game. Without spoiling anything, there is a place during the final battle, that literally just has invisible walls on the field. It makes no sense and ruins your ability to position yourself without teleport. And if you do teleport, you can cheese your way out of this fight by teleporting to the other side of the invisible wall while enemies run around. This is dumb. Combine it with the fact that some enemies can one-shot you (and I'm talking about normal difficulty here, btw), the character animations bug out, enemies get stuck in the columns etc.  And while we are on the topic of endgame, let me talk about multiplayer quickly. You know, in the first one both characters had something to say in the dialogue and any player could sway the NPC his way. Well, not here. If you are talking to somebody, the other players have absolutely 0 control over how the dialogue goes. They can pick a comment after it, like ""yeah, I support you"" or ""nah, I don't agree"", but that doesn't make any difference. There is no morality or stat changes based on it, and of course anyone has to live with the choices you've made.  So, what does it have to do with endgame? Well, over the course of our multiplayer game, I was tasked with talking to most NPC, because I had the best stats for it... except before the final fight, where despite me coming to the NPC we needed to talk to, they started talking to the other player (and trust me, we tried to force them to talk to me, reloading multiple times to try and engage them differently). However, while talking to that player (who was playing a male character), the NPC constantly addressed him as a female (and I was playing one). This seriously ruined any immersion we had left after numerous bugs and broken quests we encountered on the way there.  There are a few other fantastic examples of quests that frustrated us a lot, but I can not talk about them without spoilers, so... spoilers (skip it if you don't want any). So, there's a quest about a wedding. The groom is being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who wants bride's riches but she doesn't know about it. You can find his diary where he explains all his plans. Can you give it to her? Nope. Can you give it to her parents? Nope. You can, however, confront him about it. Ok. Let's talk. He tells you that he wants your help in killing the bride's father. If you say no... that's it. The quest doesn't finish, but you can do absolutely nothing else. If you talk to father - nothing, bride - nothing. If you talk to the groom again... nothing. You can't change your mind to progress this quest. Turns out, the way you finish it is - accept the murder and then go about betraying the groom if you want. Yay... variety... *facepalm*  There is another quest that involves a person who killed his master. You can figure it out by talking to master's spirit. And the person himself is sitting in the tavern, talking about how he loves the stew a lot. You can promise his master's spirit to deal with him. Logically, the first thing that we thought about is - poison the stew. Right? Makes sense? You can do it in the crafting menu, you can give him the stew. Great? Not great. It has absolutely no effect on him. Attacking him is also a bad idea, because it turns everybody in the town hostile to you. Turns out, you MUST find a special poison that is not lethal, but will make him run to the toilet where you'll deal with him. And that's the ONLY solution.  What the ♥♥♥♥?  Moving on. Here's how crowd control works in this game. Every character and enemy has physical armor and magical armor. Until this armor is 0, no crowd control of appropriate type works on them. You can love this system or hate it, doesn't matter, it's how it works. Or at least it is how it used to work until one patch changed the single crowd control spell. The spell is ""Provoke"". And it does what you may expect, taunts the target so it automatically attacks the one who used it. And it ignores armor. Now, imagine that the enemy taunted your whole party, and you are now stuck watching them fight automatically. And you could not prevent it. Sounds like fun to you yet? Wait, there's more. Normally, in RPG ""taunt"" skills make your characters use auto attacks and that's it. Which sure, can be annoying for mages, but it doesn't ruin the combat completely. But no, not in Divinity. Here, the taunted character not only uses skills (which, I remind you, go on lengthy cooldowns and can cost ""source"" which is a semi-limited resource), but also uses items from your inventory. Your rare and expensive potions, grenades, magical arrows, scrolls. My character ate all my tea leaves which I was saving for the final battle and drank the super limited quest potion that, again, I was saving for the occasion, after which she used some of my best skills randomly (it's AI, it is stupid), and when I finally got control back, I had a mage with all the skills on cooldown, all my rare items used, and nothing to do but auto attack or reload the save... Who the ♥♥♥♥ thought this was a good idea? Oh, and to add insult to injury, my character's summon used to have ""provoke"" by default as well. Guess what, after the patch, they removed it. Great job, guys, great job...    Overall, this game is fine. It has nice tactical combat (minus Provoke), mostly interesting dialogue (at least for the one who initiates it), and it looks very good with it's various elemental effects and armors. But this game is just that - ok. It doesn't deserve any GOTY titles, it doesn't deserve all the praise it gets. It's not some RPG messiah. It's buggy, it has horrible balance issues, it is a fairly bad experience for your multiplayer partners (or for you, whoever doesn't get to experience dialogues), it has tons of unfinished quests or quests that just don't make any sense. The more you play this game, the more it feels like early access that needs a lot of polish to be good. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it patched in a very long time (2 months at the time of this review), it seems like the developers decided that it's ""good enough, whatever"".  Well it's not. I'm sorry, but it is not good enough."
AshtonTheMelon,153,69,11,"December 5, 2017",Not Recommended,101.7,"I put this game as the most heart-breaking non-recommendation of any game I have ever played. I will try to explain why I feel this way below.  First and foremost, this game is a buggy mess. Many people have reported otherwise, but for me personally quests breaking, dialog boxes glitching out, character's and choices not lining up sometimes, it just feels like you are playing a beta. Hell, the beta I played felt more completed.  —This game brands itself as a classic rpg experience, but also doesn't know if it wants to railroad you or let you explore to it's contents. With the way the game's quest system is set up, simple discovery of things won't always intitate quests, and if it does, they are partial and don't provide any context unless you look up a guide. What? A weird enemy is speaking your name and talking to you and then it attacked you? Oh, you killed it? Welp, the quest can't be intitated now. All for mute. Exploration is nearly down right punished unless you explore the *correct* way.  —The game's combat system is great, or it would be if it weren't for it's overbloated stats. This literally makes one or two levels a difference between going through a cake walk or having the most frustrating experience you will ever had. A lot of boss fights, looking at you final fight, are just down right poorly designed. And I will talk about the ending portion of this game in a minute, but I personally was on level, with a fairly diverse party, healer/magic user, ranger, tank, and two-handed death knight, and I was still struggling against enemies who just out paced me in numbers alone. Regardless of the best armor you can buy or find at that level, the best spells or gear you use, the enemy will 9/10 feel like they are constantly beating the♥♥♥♥♥♥out of you. Which is fun and challenging some of the time, but if cheesing a victor, which is what a lot of people on the forums recommend, is the way to win a fight, then that is a bad design.  The game's skills are also fairly poor. One in particular being persuasion. Unless you have a character that has points in that skill, good luck every getting a success. The game uses your stats ""Strength, Constitution, Memory"", and what not as the base of whether you will have an easier time successing in that dialog. Except, it doesn't tell you, that unless you have points in the ""Persuasion talent"" you will fall 9/10. Considering you can't put the person with the persuasion points in every bit of dialog, it's a flaw.  Inventory management gets ridiculious later on in the game. Weapons and items you achieve, do to the bloated stat system, get out paced dramatically, most ""important"" items are garbage, one specifically I will adress in a minute. A lot of characters and elements of the story are never clearly defined or expanded upon. They just throw it at you and hope it sticks. Good writing doesn't need to explain itself to give you an understanding, that isn't the case here. Hell, the narrator of the game, the one who starts the whole game off, seems like an important character, but she only appeared a few times in my game and her quest was never resolved. Yet, in the end sequence, she is described as someone I should feel sympathy for when all she did was try and kill me.  A lot of choices *don't* matter. It's just an illusion. And some choices are just down right better than anything else.  And so much more.  But I could forgive all of that. There are an astounding amount of small issues that just build and build, but I could forget all of it, because there is sooooo much to love in this game. The writing and characters can be great, the music and world are something you love exploring, and the combat can be fun and exciting.  But.  The sad ♥♥♥♥ing excuse this game calls an ending, the mess of writing, the end fight, and the actual bug that occured for me, just♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off. It was insulting.   —SPOILERS AHEAD—  The last act of this game is a mess. Filled with inconsistencies, missing plot threads, vague comments, lack of direction, and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ resolution to add to it. One big example of this is Anathema. I gathered the parts for it in the previous act because the idea of a talking sword sounded promising. The man creating it, Tarquin, says speak to him later about it's assembly. You ask him, and he says it will be ready when it's ready. APPEARANTLY, you have to find an UNRELATED note, in a random vault that describes this one character you have seen twice is actually Braccrus Rex, and only THEN can he give you this weapon. It's an OP weapon (or at least it is suppose to be), has the best stats in the game, but one durablity and will break after a single hit. Except, despite it being sold to you as this Anti-Braccrus weapon, it barely does anything to him. It will deal a chunk of his armor or health, but any skill you use will only get one hit off before it breaks as Larian patched it so that it could break if used with skills. So now it is completely useless.  But on to the final confrontation. I played as Fane, repeling the sins of my past the entire game, despite it wanting me to pray to the God King. I wouldn't. My friends, Ifan and The Red Prince, trusted me to become divine and my lover, Lohse (probably the only thing that kept me in this game was her excellent character) agreed as well. We get to the final fight and we discover the person we have been chasing all this time, Dalis, is my daughter. Can't interact with her at all beyond that. You are then given a choice, Surrend and destroy the world's source, turning all of the world into husks, or fight to the bitter end. I chose to fight.  You then get into a fairly difficult boss battle where, after beating a single enemy, that isn't defined so good luck figuring it out, you are then thrust into a MORE difficult boss battle, with respawning bosses that you have already beaten. Did I mention that you still have to fight those you just were fighting, as well as starting all of this with whatever health/armor you were at before? Does it sound frustrating because it is. Not only was that a nightmare, if you just agree to surrender, your ending isn't affected and instead you gain 7 allies who all target one character who, you guessed it, ends the ENTIRE fight. I didn't even deal the finishing blow. Then, regardless of how you got there, they just let you choose to become divine or not. Completely making all of the struggles these ♥♥♥♥ing character's put me through pointless.  Not only that, the current endings for fane are ♥♥♥♥ing bugged. If you choose to ascended to Divinty, it automatically gives you a bad ending like allowing the voidwoken into the world. So, you are pretty much stuck with give the entire world source, or remove it from the world.  And you can't even choose to go with one of your companions. Did you spend an incredible amount of time crafting a relationship with one of them, only for the only thing to seperate you being ""you are now in charge of your destiny?"" Seriously. What the ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. I would have forgiven so much for this game if they gave you just a bit of player agency at the end, instead of just seeing the person my character is supposedly in love with walking away to go do what? Play guitar in a bar? Why can't I go?   It's just all so ♥♥♥♥ing much. It made the entire game feel tainted and scewed and I can't in all good faith recommended it."
Nameless Voice,262,84,8,April 7,Not Recommended,152.4,"Great worldbuilding, writing and attention to detail marred by bad and often frustrating game mechanics and poor design decisions.  I really enjoyed the first Divinity: Original Sin, so when the Kickstarter for this one came around, I backed it, expecting the game to be more of the same, but better. Unfortunately, it didn't quite work out like that. Some apsects of the game are certainly improved over the previous one, but other areas feel like a step backwards instead.  Worldbuilding As we've come to expect from Larian games, it's clear that a lot of love went into crafting the world of Divinity: Original Sin 2. It is packed with small details; hidden corners, small side-quests, interesting NPCs, readables, and item descriptions. They also thought of almost everything, with the game often reacting to and acknowledging unusual or unexpected behaviours (such as defeating an enemy who is expected to be unbeatable at that point.)  The quests are usually well-written and the companion characters each have their own distinct personality and unique storyline, which adds a lot of depth to the game. The main story also has good writing, though the plot itself is a bit meandering and, without giving too much away, most of the game's endings don't really resolve many plot threads.  Mechanics Unfortunately, where Divinity: Original Sin 2 really starts to come apart is in its mechanics, and especially in the changes made to its mechanics since the original game.  Armour The main problem comes from the introduction of the new armour and status effect system. Every character has a value for physical and magical armour, which can be damaged by attacks of the appropriate type, and are generally immune to most status effects while their armour holds (with magical armour blocking magical-based statuses, such as Stunned, and physical armour blocking physical-bases statuses, such as Knocked Down.)  This does a number of things.  First of all, because attacks of one type do not affect the armour of the other type, the most effective party composition is one where all of the charaters deal the same type of damage. For example, if you have three physical and one magical damage dealer, then the mage will very often feel useless because she has to wear down the enemies' magical armour by herself before she is even able to deal any damage, while the three physical characters can help each other knock down their opponents' physical armour. She probably won't even bother attacking enemies because by the time she has worn through their magic armour on her own, her allies will probably have killed them already. That leaves the mage mostly relegated to a support / buff role.  Second, the fact that most elemental effects are blocked by magic armour relegates the first first game's unique elemental system to a much more minor role. Surfaces are mostly meaningless against enemies because they won't break through their magic armour, and the combination of elemental effects (such as water + lightning to stun) are also far less prominent when the game is all about breaking down opponents' armour.  Third, enemies tend to have a lot more armour than player characters (even more so on Tactician difficulty, which mostly just turns enemies into damage sponges), so that means that your team will be struggling to get through the enemy armour in order to apply some of your skills to them, while they will easy burn through your armour and apply their negative effects to you.  ItemsAnother problem is the item system. Items gain stats as you level up, and the rate of difference becomes exponential at later levels, so you have to constantly swap out your items for new ones to stay relevant, while  the randomly-selected item stats make it very hard to find a really good item even when it is the right level. You spend a lot of time comparing item statistics and swapping out loot, made more awkward by the fact that any items sold to merchants are randomly mixed in with their new items, making it almost impossible to find good items from anyone you've sold items to. By the final chapter, the stat escalation has become ridiculous, and for some reason the merchants don't even have much stock, so you'll almost never even find any decent items for sale.  You also can't get around the problem by using crafting, since the crafting system in DOS2 has been completely gutted. You can only craft the most basic of weapons, can no longer craft magic items, and can no longer upgrade your items throgh crafting (other than by using one fairly rare late-game item). For the most part, crafting is only useful for creating skill books, spell scrolls, and potions.  SkillsOn the plus side, the skill trees in DOS2 are very well crafted, with each having a plethora of unique and interesting skills in it.  You can play a viable character by specialising in any one (or mix) of those skill trees - though you are somewhat limited in your choice by the armour system and the desire to have only one damage type in your party.  Your characters can no longer use every skill that they know automatically - instead, they can only use skills which are memorised, and the number of spells that can be memorised at once is based on the new Memory stat. This helps prevent that problem in DOS1 where a character had multiple skillbars all full of different skills. There are also fewer skills which are very similar to each other.  The game also introduces Source Points. These are rare points that allow you to use powerful Source skills. Your characters all start off with 1 maximum source point, and can get up to 3 during the course of the story.  Because Source points are rare, especially in the earlier parts of the game (and the main method of acquiring them is kind of evil), they often feel ""too valuable to use"". The game introduces new ""blessed"" and ""cursed"" statuses, which affect surfaces in interesting ways (such as blessed water surfaces healing people standing on them.) Bless and curse also cancel each other out. Your characters gain the ability to bless surfaces fairly early on, but it uses a Source Point, making it incredibly costly to use. The enemy, on the other hand, have no shortage of Curse spells, which lead to two of the most annoying effects in the game - cursed blood (which is extremely common, as one of the most common enemy type bleeds it) makes anyone standing on it take damage from healing, and cursed ice surfaces have a random % chance of freezing anyone who walks over them.  What this means is that you are often fighting in frustrating combat situations where you either don't have access to some of your abilities (healing), or where you can randomly lose fights because of a % chance of being frozen solid. You can use Bless to remove these cursed surfaces, but that costs a rare Source point, and the enemy can often just cast more Curses (or just bleed cursed blood) to negate your use of that costly spell.  The most powerful skills in each tree are Source skills, which cost source points, and use 2 or 3 points of memory, so not only are they extremely expensive to cast, they also take up as much Memory as multiple other skills. This makes getting the highest skills in each tree extremely disappointing because you almost never get to use them and are probably better off not even bothering to memorise them and to instead use the slots for basic skills.  Overall the Source point system just makes any abilities that require it annoyingly costly to use, effectively removing some of your options for no particularly good reason, and doesn't really provide anything interesting or positive to the gameplay.  ConclusionDivinity: Original Sin 2 certainly isn't a bad game, but it's still disappointing compared to the first game. If you are on the fence about it, I would recommend waiting for further patches or an enhanced edition to hopefully fix some of its myriad flaws."

LockedandFiring,277,1,0,"October 27, 2017",Not Recommended,40.5,"I recommend this game, yes. But is it worth the hype? No. Does it live up to all the hype? No. The game begins to feel repetitive and dull after a few hours and begins to make you angry. The game seems like a mix between Diablo 3 and silent storm, mixed with MMO components; However, I enjoy that aspect of it. The story feels so dull that at times I dont give a flying ♥♥♥♥ about whats going on I just want to kill something...anything just to give me something to do. I love the aspect of making it rain water or blood and then electrifying that or setting the entire field ablaze with poison or oil from numerous sources. I received this as a gift and I play it with them but theres times they get mad at me cause i'll agro the traders or the guards or a tough enemy before we're done preparing cause I just get bored. The trading mechanic makes me want to have an aneurysm at times, remember to get paid for the product match the price in products or physically count out the money from the merchants inventory. I like the leveling system it's fairly simplistic and straight forward, however, personally me, when I get to the perks screen theres so many different things in it it feels overwhelming and so your just like, ""who cares?"" and pick something you think might help you and your party. The things I really like about the game is the races, classes, and abilities. Those things make he combat really good especially for turn based combat. If you choose undead health potions and poisons are the complete opposite for you, elves are cannibals, and everyone is racist against dwarves....it's a happy little world! There are spells and abilities that seem worthless at first glance but every spell has a purpose, like a spell that makes it rain but does no damage is very important and can give you an advantage. I rate the game a 6.5/10, not great but not bad either. Oh did I mention it is a buggy mess?"
Earl Russel Browder,144,19,5,"December 26, 2017",Not Recommended,15.4,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game you stay up til 5:00 am playing because the story and world are so engrossing.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game where you can customize your party's skills to a crazy degree and, in theory, play any way you want.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game where every character has a story to tell and where the game world feels truly alive.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is also the kind of game you can end up in a game-ending fight because you misclick on something and have to reload an autosave from 40+ minutes ago.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is also the kind of game that gives you very vague pointers to a quest that you can fail simply by picking an unmarked dialogue option or by not speaking to some unmarked person in an unmarked location whose name is some unrecognizable fantasy mumbo-jumbo listed in a horribly unhelpful journal system.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is also the kind of game where you can tab out, grab a glass of water, then tab back in and the eight enemies with twice your stats you're fighting so you can progress in the story still won't be done TPK-ing you.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is also the kind of game to give you five different dialouge options and have the outcome be the same no matter which one you pick, even if you simply attempt to walk into the room and blow the person you're talking to up.  Of course, it's pretty obvious I'm just bad at the game, but ♥♥♥♥ me for wanting a game I can play on normal without cheesing it, right? I've put hundreds of hours into isometric rpgs (NWN, Tyranny, Baldur's Gate) and I've never encountered one so paradoxically annoying as this one.   The ""story mode"" makes the game a joke, yet the classic mode requires more build metamancing and AI exploitation than actual tactics to beat. The game gives you horribly vague breadcrumbs that you're supposed to follow for quests in a pointerless open world, yet sometimes railroads you into doing things while making you think you have a choice. It's absurd. It's simply not fun for me.  Clearly it's a subjective and unpopular opinion, but I don't reccomend this."

Loupy,50,8,0,April 5,Not Recommended,88.8,"What could have been a rich gameplay experience gets trashed by several questionable design decisions.   Stat system with unique contributes to character design? Mucked up somehow by cheap builds and a dozen bad-build pit traps.  Relatively one-of-a-kind terrain manipulation? Almost all mid/end-game fights end up in one giant pool of cursed necrofire.  Everyone loves crafting systems! ..what am I saying? No one loves crafting systems, and this one ought been aborted at conception.  Level scaling is pretty awful. Very little difference in gear from 1-5, but by 14+, you want to repurchase all your gear every level.  Plenty of skills to go around and mesh and make weird combos. ..with too-long cooldowns and a Memory requirement that eats up half your stat allocation. Civil abilities that are damn near required to find quests don't come quickly enough. Talents are spiffy, but sparse and not applicable to some builds.  Loved the voiceover work. That's a plus. Shame about the WORLD THAT DESPERATELY WANTS TO DIE and is awash in /r/14anddeep moral greyness that presents the worst people being required to do quests for to get xp.   It started off so interesting, but fell flat.

aphex,192,34,3,"October 22, 2017",Not Recommended,88.0,"This is the first review I've bothered to write about a game in my 14 years of being on steam. I'm taking the time because I'm extremely frustrated with the incredible dive in quality and game play experience the game takes after the opening chapter.  I'm voting this game down because, while I completely love the oepning zone I've found the rest of the game to be frustrating and tedious. At the start of this game you'll feel like exploring and experimenting with everything you come across because there's so much you can do. But in the second section the randomness in difficulty and scaling will force you to become tactical and calculated. You will feel that exploration is punished by mobs outside your viable level range, but you won't be provided with clear targets to persue. What was beautiful and fun becomes tedious and boring very quickly.  Combined with the many, many, dialogue and quest bugs, this makes the game far less than appealling.  Before going into details I want to add that this isn't about the difficulty. If I respec my characters in certains ways, take advantage of min/maxing, and use tried and true tactics while avoiding out of reach fights, then the game is easy to continue with. But everything about this world screams that I shouldn't have to do that! That there should be some way to afford my skill books *without* needing to steal. That I should be able to make a persuassion check without full min/max into the required stats. None of that is the case - after Fort Joy you are severely limited in scope for experimentation by the systems of play.  I loved Fort Joy! I thought about the game all the time, ways to do things, stuff to try. And just like that, almost instantly, I'm completely hating it. Tells you a lot about where the time an effort was spent.   The details below...  Fort Joy is great - the game feels polished and balanced. Some fights are hard and some are easy but playing on Tactician level difficulty I felt like it was a tough, punishing, but ultimately fun experience. After Fort Joy the game takes a huge dive in polish while the difficulty level becomes very randomised.  There are fights which seem absolutely natural to the flow of the zone, and which are initiated by dialogue (so you don't just avoid them) which are stupidly more difficult than the large boss battles you've just played through. To be clear, these are little plebs you're fighting, the same types of guys you fought on Fort Joy, but suddenly they are 3-4 levels higher than you can possibly be when entering the zone. This is such poor game design. I'm literally pointed to find these character as my main quest only to enter a fight that I have to completely cheese to get through, and it has no story implication. It's not a special fight. It's just some normal dudes, who can kill any of your characters in one turn.  It's not just one fight either. There's level 8 fights right next to 8*lvl 11 mob fights and no discernable way for you to see the danger coming. Again, this is bad game design - you're being led down one path and being flogged for it.   If there were pointers, or there was an indication of where you *should* go, then I'd be less frustrated. But the game offers you nothing. The Journal is almost useless - in fact it was like this in Fort Joy as well but the quests themselves were more clear cut and controlled, giving a sense of exploration and freedom while also not throwing you far out of your depth unless you wanted that. Sometimes I did, and got smacked for it occassionally, but that was just. In Reaper's Coast there is no such sense of restriction, you just have to blunder around blindly and hope.   Part of the problem with this is the level scaling. This has been detailed elsewhere but the difference in levels can have absolutely huge implications on your ability to fight. Again, this in itself isn't a problem, but when you combine it with a lack of information and where you *could* go then it's painful.  Other problems post Fort Joy:  Terrible scaling of dialogue checks - I can win none of them and I hear this is a common problem. For a game that encourages you to try different things, it also absolutely enforces min/maxing of your characters to succeed. Which makes the required stats for roles to be successful very stupid.  Economics - Right now you essentially need to use pickpocket to be able to get most of the skills you require. You also require Barter min/max on one character, and Lucky on another character helps a lot. Without those three things you cannot expect to have decent equipment after Fort Joy. Given that skills also cost money you get punished also from the amount of fun you have, not just the difficulty from lower level equipment. Interestingly enough even killing vendors and everyone doesn't give you that much gold - you really have to gimp the economic system if you want access to skills. Costs also, by the way, scale poorly with levels.  Polish and Bugs - there are a lot of bugs in dialogue, quests and logs in this section. There were quite a few in Fort Joy too but now it's just silly. Almost every quest has some strangeness too it and most look so easy to fix. You honestly have to wonder how few people Larian had QC'ing a product which is this ambitious.   In the end I really want to love this game but I've just gotten so bored in the new zone. Everytime I try something exciting I just get shut down by horrible scaling and mechanics. Fort Joy encouraged exploration and experimentation, Driftwood just encourages you to cheese and tactical perfection. I feel like I'm playing a tactical game and not a role playing game suddenly. This is disappointing."
Roy595,112,10,0,May 30,Not Recommended,7.8,"I tried to like this game. I really did. While it is technically true the game is filled with customization options, story, branching choices, etc. it quickly overwhelms and loses the player. The game basically diahreas features all over the player for the first few hours of play time. At this point you may be wondering to yourself, this game sounds great what is this idiot complaining about? Aren't gamers always complaining about linearity and lack of features in RPGs? The problem with Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of quantity over quality. Despite the truly impressive amount of features in the game, I could not escape the feeling that they were all undeveloped and paper thin. It is hard to notice because the game is just so vast but it merely hides its complete lack of depth and structure with its sheer volume of things to do. Also, the writing is bad. Like, really, really bad. 75% of it sounds like it was written by a DnD rookie trying too hard to be a dungeon master. I felt a mix of embarrassment and insult at certain dialogue trees which you will quickly find for yourself. The game just could not grab me in the first critical 10 hours of the game. Worth mentioning is the multiplayer feature which is actually kinda cool. If you have a group of (patient, open minded) friends that like playing DnD type games, this game is for you. That being said, my friends and I tried it and lasted only an hour before we broke the game out of impatience and frustration to progress quicker.  I could not get into this game at all. It slogs along, compensates for meaningful depth with a plethora of skin-deep content, and the first few hours of the game are so slow, so ungripping, I lost all interest. Maybe you think the lack of structure and hand holding is a good thing. Maybe the concept of a game stuffed with as many ridiculous features you could think of appeals to you. Maybe the game is better if you can get further in, but you'd be a much more forgiving man than I."

FieldMedic,247,17,0,"October 2, 2017",Not Recommended,172.3,"I really wanted to enjoy this title but I can't get into it. The new armor system is a let down. You can't even taunt targets without stripping them of all their armor points first. Magic is extremely difficult to use without risking friendly fire. Some of the fights are extremely poorly designed (ship fight between Acts 1 and 2, I'm looking at you) and the devs love to 'gotcha' by introducing enemies and elements into combat you couldn't have known about before starting the engagement (much save / reload and trial / error required).     The illusion of choice is also especially bad. Basically you have the way the developers want you to solve the problem and then all the wrong ways. Feel free to select the wrong way if you want things to be more difficult. On top of those things I found the story to be an extremely typical 'you are the chosen one and only you can save the universe' tale. Some very eye rolling fondling over your character really turned me off of the plot. The individual character stories are more interesting but only make up a tiny percentage of what you'll spend your time doing - which is mostly wandering around large environments looting barrels and managing your inventory.    Some final notes. Crafting is a chore but at least it's completely ignorable. There's a ton of things to read but most of that is also easily ignored. You will likely feel compelled to play one of the 'origin' characters instead of making a custom character because you miss out on content if you don't. Graphics and sounds are fine but nothing really stands out as outstanding. The entire game is voice acted which is great, although that voice acting is just serviceable. Lastly this is an incredibly long game, which I suppose means good value to some but to me means bloat and poor pacing. Divinity lost me in Act 2, which is about half way through, and I can't see myself playing another 40-50 hours of this."
Amorous Bicurious Pholidota,204,48,2,"September 16, 2017",Not Recommended,47.2,"1. UI   Menus for crafting, character sheets and so on are obstructive. Terrain such as bridges, overhanging cliffs etc block nearly all vision of your party which makes it difficult to navigate through streets and valleys. Sometimes you can end up walking all the way up a hill and through a an environment hazard because you clicked on a random cliff edge above wherever your characters were.  2. Combat and quests  Unless you thoroughly go through each area and soak up as many quests as possible you will be underleveled and undergeared. This, in combination with the ruthless AI, makes combat an absolute chore that requires savescumming.   Element interactions and environmental hazards are poorly explained and require experimentation to fully understand. So much can be going on during a fight that it is difficult to gauge what is happening at any given time. Aiming up and down cliffs also seems to have random restrictions placed on what you can and cannot hit (spells can't go over banisters, but arrows act like ICBM's when shot up from the first floor).   3. Camera  The camera is at the perfect level of awkwardness where it requires you to zoom allll the way out to see where you're going but demands you zoom back in to pixel hunt for objects. It's easy to lose track of dead bodies in tall grass or behind bushes unless you outline them with fire spells first. Sometimes a combination of bad geometry and camera angles will make it impossible for you to see enemy NPC's at all. It is very frustrating to walk into a random ambush after failing to manually save the game.  4. Map design  Maps act like extended corridors for the sake of staging ambushes. Walk into an area -> autosave function triggers -> hostile NPC gives you 1-3 responses which almost always end up in a fight.  5. Skills, attributes  The effectiveness of any given build during a blind run comes down to dumb luck.   Example: I ran into some lava slugs in a cavern. Unless I had taken the trait that allowed me to diplomatically talk to slugs/dogs/cats I would have had to fight them with a butter knife and wool clothes. I had literally no idea that would be useful prior to that situation.   There are a bunch of other, smaller issues I could also talk about but these are the core problems I have had with the game over six hours.  Edit  Whoever designed the second act boat fight is a goddamned sadist. Enemies moving before their turn, necro fire spam, inability to place my healers next to the NPC... what the ♥♥♥♥.

Ventus,269,16,1,"October 3, 2017",Not Recommended,494.2,"Like the others, too many RPG/Game busting bugs. Wait for Enhanced Edition/Sale/More patches. This game is bugged from beginning to the final quest (serious, story broken ending bugs, plenty of reporting on forums if you want to ruin it for youself, but I recommend avoiding for a while).  My final conclusion is to wait for a heavy discount and more patches to fix broken/bad content.   My gameplay hours trump most (despite being inflated by afking with game running) but i've stuck it out and tried to report as many bugs as possible. Simply put this is great game potential, yet mared by bugs everywhere (for a metric, patch 3 addressed over 100 features and bugs alone, many of which were known for months of early access). This makes the game, as it stands, very hard to enjoy as you don't know what is bugged and what is a feature. Moreover, quests, despite being completed correctly, still flag as incomplete (and thus the game treats you as having not done the stuff you did) and this alone is tire screeching for any RPG.   Features are generally much the same as D:OS1 but again they feel like beta or just bad in some areas, and splendid in others. Dialogue and Banter chat log feature has never once functioned to date. Some fights in game warrant explaination on wtf Larian was thinking (Dreamers Portal) and most of the status and features require trail and error to get a grasp of (Ring: 6 Vitality apparently means 'this ring gives you constant healing equal to the HP from 7 constitution (and each point of constitution give 7% vitality, which are your Hit Points). Personal preferences aside, quite a number of 'intended features' are either frustrating (not being able to mouse over enemy debuffs to read description) or simply are broken/never made it into the game. There is a good deal number of dialogues that are only partly voiced, meaning that its either more bugs (not playing voice script properly) or intended that way.  Another Example: The quest log (arguably important) is poorly implimented. Supposing you avoid the bugged logs, it doesn't fully complete for each zone. It also updates per interaction (so if you find a boss, then later find a note hinting where the boss is, the note will be the top update). This results in you not knowing if the quest if still in your current Act (and thus you will miss out if you leave) or if the quest is continued in the next act. Its guessing game or risk forum spoilers."
Shade,426,4,0,May 23,Not Recommended,60.2,"This game has a wonderful setting and story and for a big RPG fan like myself that is normally enough for a fantastic experience.  Unfortunately combat, even on the easiest setting, is like pulling teeth. Using the environment to your advantage is supposed to be an awesome mechanic but late game everything is cursed which hurts you but never your enemies. You can dispell it at great cost but it doesn't matter because the next time an enemy bleeds everything is cursed again. You constantly lose control of your party members to effects and when the AI controls your party it always does the dumbest possible thing.  To make things worse the AI moves at a snails pace in combat meaning their turns take too long. When facing a large number of enemies I often just alt tab and look at imgur for three to four minutes and even then sometimes the AI still hasn't finished there turn.  If you love stories than you might like this but if you are anything like me, the combat and power crawl ruins any fun you might have."

This is a direct qoute of the game's interface, which actually and directly *tells* you that the given area/encounter/fight/building/quest/blahblah/yaddayadda will get long, tiresome and frustrating. And man, does it happen often. On CLASSIC friggin difficulty. Get ready to be OHK'd a lot. Every 'boss' encounter is a few levels above you, unless you grind every single quest.  And here lies the conundrum (wrappen in an enigma (wrapped in a pastry (wrapped in a 'whyohwhy'))). Theenemies  world may be open, but your choices are *not*. Want to ventrue this way, on a whim carry-me-game-world-oh-you-open-and-free-beast-you? Nope, enemies outlevel you, you die. Want to skip running every errand in this town and continue your oh-so-mother-of-all-epicness-epic-quest? Nope, you have to talk to everything and do everyone (err, or the other way around). Because at level 10, enemies level 12 spell doom (with a capital D, capital O, capital YOUWANTMORE?). This happens constantly, meaning that for every larger fight you need a plan, a trick, a five-barrels-of-cursed-oil-in-your-inventory contingency.  It just gets tiresome.  If you have the 10 hours a day to spend on a video game, good for you, have fun. If you don't, you'll be playing this for weeks, one fight at a time, getting smashed by a 1000HP-250DMG-per-hit-voidwoken vs your 100-armor crew.  There's still a complex, large, ambitious, no-hand-holding-making-you-think game under the 5-boss-fights-per-area aggravation.

A Nameless Ghoul,115,12,0,"October 14, 2017",Not Recommended,23.2,"I really tried to get into this game, given the 10/10 scores and consistent positive feedback. The promises are all there. Multiple branching pathways, full voice acting, and battle mechanics. The problem is, the game is simply not fun. On normal difficulty level, the game simply does not provide you with the means to empower your characters and overcome main questlines without resorting to spamming/exploiting game mechanics like pickpocketing and stealth. Virtually everyone I've heard playing this game has had to resort to the same strategy in act 1 and that is not good role playing mechanics if the level threshold has been set so high that the player cannot explore and act freely.  I get that this is not a game for casuals but at least developors like Bioware give players more content and choices through which to grow characters and have a fighting chance against higher tiered enemies.  The inventory system is beyond archaic, I've literally spent one third of this game having to sift through menus and bags. It's 2017, is it too much to ask for shared inventory and filter options?  And lastly the writing...it's okay, but again, for game getting all of these coveted perfect scores, I was expecting characters and story which were a bit less tropish.  I'm not saying Origina Sin 2 is a terrible game and as I stated before, you do get all of the features and promises as stated on the box which is rare in games these days. The problem is the game just turns in to a slog where you are constantly quick loading because of high level thresholds for quests in which you have NO means whatsoever to grind a little bit or do side quests to accomate for the difficulty.  It's very clear that a lot of work and care went into making this game, but ultimately it just isn't fun and relies too much on it's gimmicky battle systems."
Jimmy_Carter,218,3,0,May 25,Not Recommended,175.8,"I think Steam probably needs a neutral option for reviews, this game being a prime reason why. The game was a solid experience through most of it, but faltered a bit in the last chapter. Throughout the first 3 chapters, I was so engrossed in the game that I tried to complete every single side quest. For the most part, I found the combat fun, inuitive and satisfying. However, as I said, the last chapter slows down a bit, and the ending... well without spoiling anything... it leaves a lot to be desired. I can see what the devs were going for with the ending, but it made me feel like most of the stuff I did was for nothing. On top of that, there are a number of other problems that got on my nerves throughout my playthrough(s). On a number of occassions, your characters are forced into unescapable dialogue, and the character that enters said dialogue is just the one that happens to be closest to the NPC. As a result of this, on several occassions I had to reload a save as options were locked off for me, because the character that was forced into the dialogue did not have the prerequisite persuasion skill or tags. Another major issue is that I found the game was somewhat linear, although it presents itself as open-world. Many of the encounters will be impossible until you reach a certain level, and as a result, I found myself having to ascertain a particular order in which to play the encounters, so that I wouldn't get trashed, and in my opinion, those defeats before I ascertained the order was not due to my skill level as at the point that I attempted them, my characters could barely make a dent into the enemy's armour or health. I also dislike the dev's decision to make you stuck with a set of companions. I would have liked to switch out my companions at will, instead of having to make my choice and go through the rest of the game with it. I didn't really have too many issues with bugs, but there were a few here and there. On top of that, the game has you go through questlines, and jump through hoops, only to find that no matter what you do, everything you did was pointless. One particular instance was a side quest during the final chapter. After going through several difficult encounters, because I didn't have a specific companion in my party, I could not continue the questline, and no matter what I did, the quest automatically failed. For the most part, the armour visuals in the game were not to my taste. I found many of them too exaggerated, especially the higher end ones, and felt that they felt out of place with the game's tone. A number of other reviews have suggested multiple playthroughs, but I wouldn't suggest that. I played through it a second time andI felt that the story mode didn't have much more to offer after a single playthrough, as the results and quests played out the same, and the only difference would be something along the lines of a three sentence difference. And it appears to me that the major consequences all stem from the mass effect 3-esque decision you make at the game's end. I'm sure the game master mode would be a lot of fun, if I could find 3 other people willing to buy a $55 game. Also, you'll find yourself at a disadvantage if you create your own character, as much of the content revolves around using one of the characters the game has picked for you. If you do, you'll miss out on a number of quests and events in the game, making the experience less enjoyable.   Ultimately, if you ignore the ending, and you are willing to deal with a lot of the problems present in the game, I would buy it on sale. But if you don't want to put in hours after hours just for a major disappointing at the end, I would spend your money elsewhere."
Daniel,180,3,0,"October 16, 2017",Not Recommended,60.8,"At first, the game is captivating. But if you are looking into a more challenging difficulty, it becomes etxremely tedious to find viable builds that survive fights. Because of the mind-boggling decision of physical and magical armor, having a party of fighters and mages makes zero sense. Why should your mages you chew through 300 magic armor, when your fighters already melted down their physical armor, and vice versa. So you either go all fighters or all mages. And because of this, only a fracture of what is possible also makes sense. And I am not talking about over-optimization, I am talking about the minimum that is requried to have fun in combat. Unfortunately, the more you progress in the story, and the more spells you unlock, the more tedious the search of a good build becomes. And then make this times two or four, depending on how many party members you have.  But balancing is not only messed up in character creation and armor system. Thievery in Act I is the difference between making Honour Mode (the highest difficulty) unbeatable without, or a walk in the park if you start stealing armor and weapon from every vendor you come across. Another skill that feels like cheating is Teleportation, making it mandatory - together with Thievery.  I don't see the point in having literally hundreds of possibilites, where only a handful are actually fun. It only makes it tedious to find those exact combinations and not suck in every fight. And I got tired looking for them after Act I."
Islendingen,320,11,0,February 21,Not Recommended,48.2,"I loved D:OS so I picked this game up expecting something similar in way of feel and experience. At the start the feeling I got was kind of like that, but with characters that felt like they had more depth to them and a revamped combat system. My inital thought was ""I wonder how this will work out. Can't wait to see the full extent of it."" I felt like the first game needed an improvement on the combat system. I liked it, but at the same time it felt like it needed some improvements, something I hoped they had adressed in D:OS2.  What I met however was a combat system that, the further into the game I got, proved itself the most tedious gameplay I have ever experienced. The addition of armor wasn't much of a problem in the beginning. It just acted as a buffer to not go full CC at the start of combat. However the further I got the more armor the enemies got, and the more boring the game became for me. Having to spend 5-10 min just grinding down enemies armor hoping you can do enough dmg to their health before they use a spell or potion to buff their armor back up, feels like a bunch of kids screaming ""you can't hurt me because I got this special armor!"" As someone who really enjoyed playing a mage that could burn, freeze, charm or sleep enemies, I couldn't get over the way the armor makes every enemy immune to all this.  I tried to get over my feelings for quite some time, and I liked the rest of the game (the story, scenery, music and just random banter and funny stuff you encounter), but the combat system ruined the experience for me. That's why I would not recommend this game if you enjoyed the combat system in the first game at all."

♥OVERKILL_Ashley♥,398,38,4,May 29,Not Recommended,120.0,"I really want to write a positive review for this game, so badly. I've never felt so conflicted on my feelings and my ""yes or no"" answer but right now i really can't suggest anyone buy this game.  Why? Well.. it's kind of not finished. Sure you have an ending but... if you're a ""normal gamer"" then you're not going to get to it due to horrific game design that seemed to be untested.  Simply put, the first act is pretty ""okay"" it's fairly balanced but a little dull due to lacking abilities that are interesting. Then act 2 is pretty open, there is a lot hidden and a lot going on, the theme of the game shines. You get new skills, story development and a fairly (most the time) balanced game. Act 3 then becomes oddly rushed.. with underwhelming endings to story arch and bizarrely easy fights. It's not the worst thing ever but it did make me feel a little concerned the game was losing direction.  Then i hit act 4.... oh boy... act 4... i.. i'm not too sure how to describe the car wreck that is act 4. Simply put, you start act 4 at level 19. The bosses and most of the enemies are level 20, which doesn't seem like a big deal... until you realize that the difference between that 1 level in gear is around... 200-300%. Yes... your items double/tripple in effectiveness from a single level. Unfortunately... you can't hit 20 without doing a number of quests in act 4... which results bosses just instantly killing your entire party in a single shot. I had a look online to see what the MLG pro gamers had for advice. The answers? Pretty much abuse flaws in the AI or bad balancing that helps you. There's no actual fair way to play act 4, you're supposed to abuse the game in order to progress. It's not something i want to do because i just don't think that's very fun.  Act 4 simply isn't anywhere near finished or even tested. Not only is the balance an utter mess, but so are the quests. Gone are your multiple options and dialogue with other npc's about your situation. Everything becomes a very finite line you MUST follow. A guy who got married on this exact day wants you to murder his new father in law, the ONLY way to finish it is to do it. Not tell his wife, not to get the local ""police"" involved, not even to mention why in his basement is effectively 30000 tonnes of this worlds equivalent of nukes. Just no, you're selling a product as if finished when it's clearly not. When act 4 is cleaned i will happily change my review.  And yes i know, people will tell me to git gud in response."

Deep.web.body.god,88,22,2,"November 22, 2017",Not Recommended,29.1,"Maybe I'm too young to know how its like the old school RPGs, but I just don't get it. The characters are completely static in anything but plot points which they do move through, but without changing. They're also pretty much all boring archetypes, the rugged mysterious Mediterranean man, the psycho, the elitist smarty pants, the royal snob, the sottish person, etc. They never surprise you, every time they react to anything its always exactly what you expect that boring cliché to say. The story is extremely derivative, and seems like a plot a computer who copy and pasted plot elements from other famous RPGs like E. Scrolls and Drag Age could have come up with on its own. The dialogue choices are mainly about which piece of information you want to know in which order rather than actually role playing/having an effect. The only difference I really see is the game actually allows you to ♥♥♥♥ up if you kill a questgiver, which isn't that unique. I'm 29 hours in and still have yet to find what people see in this game that's so amazing, and I tend to go with the general opinion. Someone please explain what is so great about it?﻿"
bruticus0,12,15,0,"October 3, 2017",Not Recommended,123.9,"We've run into a game breaking bug.  After all the patches we've been through, a game breaking bug shouldn't be present.  My wife and I both have the game.  Our inventories have become messed up we think.  The only indicators we have are five blank spots when we go to Crafting inventory.  We have even tracked down where they come from.    During Driftwood, you have a quest, Strange Cargo, to rescue a guy in a barrel.  The moment you tell him to come with you, he becomes part of your party.  In his inventory are five grenade items.  No matter what you do after that, you will have blank spaces in your Crafting inventory.  Whether you kill him on the spot, or lead him safely out of town.  You might wonder what a few missing spots would matter.  As did we.  But when you get ready to leave Act2 and go to Nameless Isle, you'll either get kicked back out to the main menu during the cutscene, or get Crash to Desktop.  If you get kicked back out, it gives Save Error 302.  We haven't been able to get any attention on the issue.  But I suspect more people may realize having the same problem as time goes on and people progress through the story.  And they'll probably lose three days worth of progress like we did, and really really not even want to finish the game anymore.  So until this is fixed, or maybe even if it does, there's gonna be at least two negative reviews on this game from us."
Myzzy,235,14,3,"December 2, 2017",Not Recommended,133.6,"If you want a quality game without tons of random nuances, please buy the Divinty: Original Sin 1. This game butchered a lot of that game's charm, but quickly cut off its face and wore it around as a facade. Sourcery feels flat and weak, and almost entirely pointless at times due to it just being sucked out of you like nothing by most every enemy you come across (not to mention they're oftentimes weak and eat your AP like no tomorrow when you can do comparable damage or effects for the same amount AP). Some of the combat scenarios you will go through are also just tedious and can take upwards of an hour and a half per fight even when you are spending less than two minutes per character turn.  Slight Edit: The difficulties are also superficial in their differences. Tactician spouts on about in its description about how enemies have special effects and think more about their moves. In truth, the enemies have double your base stats: double vitality, phys. and magic armor, and quite often double your damage. They also commonly outnumber you meaning that you are up♥♥♥♥♥♥creek without a paddle. The first voidwoken you spot upon landing on the beach have ""vampire"" which lets them lifesteal damage they do. Some enemies have a bonus spell that 'spices' things up (usually a summon or something else of the sort that also has double your stats). It's not even a fair way to play the game, because you often have to abuse game mechanics and essentially cheat with quicksaves and quickloads to get anywhere. I am by no means a noob at this game either. I played a coop save with a friend in the first original sin where we both picked lone wolf, which rendered us locked to a two man party. We functioned as a team and got through the playthrough easy peasy as a first playthrough. That was a fair challenge. This game's difficulties are nothing more than jokes to play on people expecting a tactical difference in how the AI functions.  The biggest kicker, and the most apparent reason for my negative review is that the game is HORRIBLY optimized for Radeon cards. I have an AMD Radeon R9 Fury Sapphire and it absolutely begins to cook under the pressure of this game's coding. Within six minutes of starting the game, mind you this is only at the main menu, my graphics card's temperature jumps from 54 degrees Celsius to 72 degrees. Six minutes. On the menu. I have a water cooling system and near to seven fans in my PC that are all optimized to keep my tower as cool as possible. For comparison, I can play Doom on Ultra graphics at 1920x1080 resolution for hours without my PC trying to become an easy bake oven. The problem persists even on the lowest graphics settings as if it just wants to fry my GPU (once again, something that happens in no other game regardless of graphics settings). This game is absolutely a hog, and even the devs know it because they always talk about needing to remove peripherals from your USB or shutting off all non-essential programs. What is this: a pre-flight check-up? Just program your game better and give AMD cards a fair chance with optimization.  This problem is not just me either. Many other AMD users, based on community posts, support tickets, and forum posts, have had similar issues are just being flat-out unable to play the game because it crashes their graphics drivers. If you are an AMD user, avoid this game and buy its predecessor- a game you will enjoy far more. This might seem like pointless ranting, but as a consumer who has tested multiple things to adjust how this game functions. When I can't even play the game with my friends for more than a couple hours at a time (and at risk for damaging my PC) then this game has serious problems."
frederickhxu,101,62,9,"December 31, 2017",Not Recommended,81.9,"This is a heartbreaking negative review, but it is one that must be said. This game does not respect your time, or your agency as a player. The ending completely butchers the experience. Every choice you've made, every decision you went through, all the lives you save/lost, have no meaning in the game world in the end.  You have two choices in the end. One results in the world not changing at all, the other results in the world falling into chaos. Either way, you as a player have no control over any of it, and that's a damn shame.   Now, that being said, the glowing reviews do get 1 thing right: the first half of the game is quite uniquely done and is excellent. Acts 1 and 2 are excellent, I don't need to go into any real detail as all the glowing praise the game is receiving centers around those first two sequences.  Act 3 is generic, sluggish, and the combat is unfairly balanced towards the player (ironically). It's intended to be a filler act, but that's understandable. You get some nice lore revelations here, at least that saves this act.  Act 4 is horrible. It took what Act 3 did badly, and dragged it out. 20 hours of puzzles, hidden switches, locked doors, all for what? For predictable plot points. Things revealed in Act 2 and 3 and quest progression all play out exactly how you expect them to. A tedious and boring slog through an unfinished and rushed map. As for the combat, their effort to make it challenging results in cheap tactics. Bosses will always go first, and have large amounts of action points to spam spells endlessly and kill your party outright, and all throughout the act you will need to result in strange gimmicks to conclude fights.  One very positive thing though: The companion system and the character building is insanely well-done. If you are to buy this game, buy it for those companion quests. Very well done quests indeed. This is where the replay value lies, to experience the quests of the allies that you didn't get to adventure with the first time through.  As for the ending, I can't reiterate it enough. The game simply does not deliver. All the creative world building and world impact that you can make in Acts 1 and 2 are erased, and replaced with a generic blanket ending that will ultimately overshadow the adventure and leave you feeling dissatisfied. Even your companions are generically written in the ending.  What a damn shame. This is a game that was released unfinished. I suggest keeping this title in the back of your mind, and when they do release an Enhanced Edition that rectifies the problems that arose from (likely) rushed development, I will wholeheartedly recommend it.

Raziel,65,7,0,"October 16, 2017",Not Recommended,149.5,"Before you downvote, I definitely enjoy(ed) this game.  This review is just to notify customers who are looking into purchasing this.  I am not hating on the game, nor attacking, but expressing that I would not recommend it in its current state. Although, if you have any information that may compliment this game/solutions to included problems below, then I'll be more than happy to test those and alter this review accordingly  Now, you may expect the game to be flawless now that it's officially out of Beta, but there are some things completely askew; content is missing.  And, to some, that content can be extremely valuable if you like to immerse yourself into the world of Divinity.  Voice: Dialogue is missing in particular parts of the game with certain NPCs - even their portraits are missing.  There are sections within the game where the Narrator will say one thing, but the text will say otherwise.  (Narrator will say 'she/her' when the dialogue states 'he/his') During party conversations, one person's dialogue will be skipped completely and instantly followed up/replaced by another party member.  (In my experience, Ifan's voice would not be there, but Beast's voiceline would be spoken)  Loading Times/Party Play: Now you may have seen a lot of people complaining about this - but they are right; loading times are quite tacky as of now.  During Fort Joy, loading times were bearable - with a load time of roughly 3-5 minutes.  Although, as you progress, the duration gets seemingly longer; with times fluctuating anywhere between 9-20 minutes.  Keep in mind that loading times vary if you are playing solo, compared to multiplayer. Conclusion/TL;DR: Great game with a lot of potential.  It was released from Beta, in my opinion and experienece, too early.  If you are okay with missing content such as voicelines and misguided/incorrect text, accompanied by lengthy loading times, then this may be for you.  But for now, I would suggest waiting before making this purchase. "

Amitaya,156,100,7,"November 6, 2017",Not Recommended,121.8,"I'll split this into pro and contra and try to explain my negative aspects. The pro will be shorter because they don't need explanation.  The game is not for everyone. Many however will still like it. So if you are considering a buy, read the below points and ask yourself if they are important for you. I am a completionist. I tend to explore every nook and cranny and I like to manage equipment and skills in RPG's. I'm an old school RPG lover, always comparing classical RPG's to giants like Icewind Dale or Neverwinter Nights 2.  Pro  - Much heart was put into this project. There is love for detail which can be especially well seen in the area design and side quests.  - The music is, like in it's predecessor awesome.  - The diversity of spells and skills is impressive  - there are many secrets, hidden areas and treasure to be found everywhere  - The first act feels like the last game, it has a clear goal, you get a big area with sub areas to explore  - There are difficulty settings to adjust for different playstyles  - Modability is there and it's easy to mod or add already existing ones  - It's relatively bug free  - For an isometric RPG the graphics are really nice    Contra  - The UI: It's ok in the beginning, but later in the game you have to fight a war against cluttering of hundreds of small items with no availability of a search function. Item and craft UI feel half heartedly done and clumsy.  You don't even get nameable bags to put stuff in to sort it manually.  - Romances come late but then way too sudden. There is almost no personal idle banter and when they happen, it's like being forced into a relationship with someone you know nothing about, even while traveling with them the whole time. There is no additional remarks/chats/mentions/opportunities after you take a romance. You feel like being ""together"" with a robot. Also companions don't see/care what you do and with whom. You can romance all options and then, late pick one. Still no idle banter. No personal conversations at all.  - Bugs are few but the ones that are in can break your game or kill all your fun. (possible spoiler example below)  - After the first Act, the pace of the game slows down to a crawl. Instead of being able to chose areas to explore like in the grand RPG's of old: Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights, you get one freakingly huge area and are thrown in without much word of what to do and where to go. This paradigm stays until the end of the game. You don't get much info in your journal of what to do and where to go. You get the huge areas and can go explore all of it. The problem: you are expected to explore the places in the order Larian thought. But get no info on what order that is - apart from too hard (or too easy) enemies.  You can't simply take one single area and explore it as everything is connected and around every corner is another sidequest. Why do you do them you may end up asking yourself. The answer: to get the levels necessary to do your main quest. That's not roleplaying. That's powerleveling.  - Equipping new stuff is a horror: when the old item provided skill points that you used to learn and activate abilities, then on equipping something else you immediately deactivate all abilities your new gear doesn't allow you to wear anymore - without any warning. You then have to look through all the learned skills by yourself and find the ones that were deactivated. Becomes super annoying late game as there are easily a few hundred skills available.  - A few hundred skills is simply too much. It may be a nice idea to have freedom of using what fits the playstyle but with 30ish skills for every school (warfare, scoundrel, hunter and all 8(?) magic schools) and on top of that dozends of secret spell-combinations it's just overwhelmingly too much. - The main quest feels awkward to play. For most of the game I was uncertain if the story aims to force the player into some kind of Battle Royale with their friends. I quit the game at the last dungeon because I lost any interest in finishing it so I don't know if it indeed does. The feeling however, kinda ruined the atmosphere pretty good. And the companions did nothing you would expect in an RPG in such a situation. No long discussions about friendship/love/the right to live. They just say ""yeah, yeah later"". - The world Larian paints in this game is so ugly and imoral, that in the late game I was even considering of ending it for good. Whereever you look, you see discusting atrocities being done upon innocent people and beings. And not just from ""the bad guys"". Beggars torture their dogs, innocent and virtuous seeming (and presented, and behaving) girls who are first saved by you, turn into the next Hitler of their race and want to kill all intelligent life that is not of their race and ready their people for war. People (including your companions and yourself) seem to just shrug off the fact that they talk to mass murderers (your party). It's a cruel, dark, heartless and worthless world. Whatever ending one pursues, it's made clear by Larian that the world may change. But not the nature of it's inhabitants. Surely a completely different from what we saw in the brilliant Original Sin 1. - Riddles are really just time wasting unintuitive walls to make you google the solutions. They are not fun, not interesting and the bigger ones are annoying to handle. I just quit one after trying to solve it for 45 minutes. No hint. No reaction to what you do. No response to if you got something right or not. It just sucks and destroys all fun still left.   All in all I can't recommend this game to anyone who thinks my negative points would be important for them too. Else, enjoy. If all negative points are unimportant to you, this will be a great experience for you.       Example of fun killing bug  (POSSIBLE SPOILER - STOP READING IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE GAME)               You have to try and get three source points in act 2. If you don't, then a certain NPC will help you out with that by sacrificing a part of their soul for you. In my game I had all three but the NPC did not recognize this. They still answered like I had not and sacrificed part of their soul. This lead much later to their demise. This again lead to them not being available at the end of the biggest and most interesting side quest in the game. That lead to me being forced to cheat to get a good ending for that particular quest which killed all the fun... (SPOILER END)"

Watch as your character gets shuffled down in real time so you miss 2 whole turns before acting, despite having a stellar initiative score.   -Unlike a truly freeform game like D&D tabletop, your choices are dictated by the parameters of the game architecture, rather than a human GM.  This makes predicting the outcome of almost any decision you make difficult, even if something makes sense.  Save-scum often, which isn't that fun, and breaks immersion. -No confirmation system in iventory management, crafting, or bartering.  This adds a level of difficulty in tedium that is unnecessary.  It's like having to make DEX checks while trading so you don't sell the wrong item. -Artificial difficulty curve that takes away from the overall experience of the story, which isn't so great to begin with. -Lazy storytelling that makes me feel like I'm playing a mediocre D&D game with a novice DM. -Arx is so buggy, even post-update (10/8/17), it is an exercise in frustration that had me eager to just finish the game and get it over with. -As of today, final battle crashes mid-fight during second phase.  Tried it several times, but it is unplayable, which has killed my interest in what happens at the end.    Overall: 5/10       I can understand why this game is getting so many accolades, but I feel that there needs to be more objective reviews out here. It is unique in a very important way: Couch Co-op.  It's one of a tiny handful of games that my wife and I can play together, and for that, we are both having fun despite the myriad flaws present.  Also, I admire Larian Studios' passion and dedication to their work, which seems a rare commodity in today's game industry.   EDIT 10/8/17: Final battle is buggy, crashes, and isn't actually that well designed as far as final battles go.  Game overall is a glitch-fest, combined with lazy, forced game design.  I may recommend it when an enhanced edition releases a year from now and everything is ironed out."

It has tons and tons of side quests where you can make small, meaningless impacts on the world around you.  The game likes to play in the moral grey areas.  The biggest disappointment for me was the ending.  Your decisions during the game don't matter so much as a multiple choice selection of what ending you would like.  The game is quite good if you don't mind the ending."

Skarn,397,55,7,June 24,Not Recommended,121.0,"This review contains spoilers.  I'm an avid BD / IWD fan so i was excited for Divinity 2, after beating it, I can say that divinity has elements of a great game but has many fundamental problems that destroy the experience for a typical player, I played this game with my other half and I'd highly recommend not playing this game with more then a single player, I'll get into why later in my review.  Lets start with what makes divinity good: the story, lore, characters are all very rich, there is a lot to explore, every NPC is fully voiced and the world is beautifully crafted. There is a delight in finding hidden goodies and being rewarded for really taking your time to search through each area.   Divinity excels in and out of combat, and the first 2 parts (islands) of the game are a masterpiece. Fights are balanced and your party feels like they are able to handle most encounters without the game ever feeling unfair. There is fun to be had everywhere, NPCS are interesting to talk to and there are many off the beaten path quests that will make you laugh out loud, make you feel genuine sadness and sometimes infuriate you at a game character. Last but not least is the puzzle elements, there are some great small puzzles to be done as well as a handful larger puzzles that make you feel great for solving them.  As the first 2 parts (islands) are so well crafted it makes the cracks in the second 2 parts (islands) that much more obvious. The third part of the game is very story-lite and feels like filler, it was extremely tedious with some key story characters thrown in for good measure to make the story tick along. Combat for the first time in the game was incrediablely easy, there were no challenging fights and nothing that tested our group of merry adventurers, which was different to the first 2 parts. It's important to note that part 3 is filler for a point later.  Despite the above, the third part of the game is mediocre/boring but still playable. The fourth part of the game is however a train wreck. Many of the quests are linear, with no objective thinking, fights are not balanced with many ""HAH GOTCHA"" mechanics put in place, only a select few standout puzzles (which were all too common in part 2) and quite frankly there are so many things trying to happen at once that it's a bit of a mess.   The story in part 4 falls apart with so many elements chucked in place that the finale of the game for me personally was A) ruined and B) hollow, part 4 of the game suffers from filler content like in part 3, but to the extent that nothing is interesting, as a player I stopped caring about the objective i was being set because the game was throwing the kitchen sink at me, so much of the content had felt ham-fisted and boring compared to the finesse of part 2 that I'd lost all emotional investment in the game that the first two parts had worked so hard to build. The game had simply gone on to long for me to care anymore, it would of benefited from removing part 3, and overhauling part 4 to be better paced and run a longer length to create a grand finale.   Part 4 also suffers from the ham-fistedness in the difficulty department with fights ranging from silly easy to ""cheese""to beat for a party that was not power gamed on NORMAL difficulty. The final fight of the game, I had to make a different choice simply because 1 of the 2 options was ridiculously hard, just because the game would 1 shot party members 2 levels higher despite my party being okay through most other fights (other then a few that were obviously overtuned, I'm looking at you doctor.)  The above is further made worse with the biggest problem of all: This game is a buggy mess.  I understand that nothing works 100% of the time, sometimes a game crashes, sometimes a quest is bugged. This wasn't the case for me throughout Divinity 2, about half way through part 2 of the game, every time I played, I ran into one of the many bug related issues listed below, shattering my immersion and often garnering my frustration at the game.  Bug 1: Save games lagging & causing the game to crash for either myself or other player. Divinity 2 has a limit on how many saves it can create, eventually causing the game to have immense lag, you have to fix this by managing your saves... why? I'm not here to manage save game files, I'm here to hammer the quick save button incase one of the many quests bug out.. which leads me to....  Bug 2: Quest bugs, this happened so many times where a quest wouldn't trigger or close or have part X fire properly, meaning time would be wasted online to find a workaround or whether I could continue on with the game, I ended part 2 of the game with 4 side-quests still open because they simply ""didn't close"".  Bug 3: *MAJOR SPOILER*: Cutscenes don't work in multiplayer, the final cutscene of the game was not shown to me because I did not ascend, so whilst the other player got to see the cut scene we'd played over 100 hours for, i was left on the ship twiddling my thumbs waiting, RUINED the ending of the game for me, I've never been angrier at a bug.  Bug 4: Inventory becomming locked, so many times this happened, where the main characters inventory would lock and no longer allow me to access it, forcing a game restart, frustrating as the game takes 2 minutes to load, and a further 2 minutes to get the other player in, this happened every playthrough in part 4.  Bug 5: Non-party leader members don't integrate into story, probably the most immersion destroying bug is that during the game, some party members will ""step"" into the spotlight to have their say should the party leader let them, but the second players characters never do this other than in moments for those character core quest lines. Player ones ifan would constantly step in and dialogue but player twos red prince and beast would never interject in a conversation and thus felt like tag alongs rather than party members.  Bug 6: Spells not working, sometimes spells would not hit their target despite a clear arch to hit an enemy, often this would been we'd need to target a different body part or some such, without the character or target moving.. ridiuclous.   In summary, Divinity 2 has great elements but I think it's unfinished and very rushed in areas, it's in dire need of bug fixing and re-writes, I wanted to love this game but I couldn't be happier that I've beaten it so I can see the back of it, a frustrating experience in the end and a wasted potential for something that could stand shoulder to shoulder with the old greats."
Cryswar,219,30,4,September 5,Not Recommended,61.4,"Wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle; despite the countless options the game wows you with even from fairly early on, the horrific game design makes a great many of approaches unplayable or pretty underwhelming.  The EXTREME overuse of enemy immunities is a big one - good luck trying to play a synergistic earth/fire caster when huge swathes of enemies are completely immune to most or all of what you can do with little to no warning - but don't worry, you can reload and respec and completely change your build to deal with them!  Hope you didn't bother bringing mixed physical and magical damage - enemies essentially have separate health bars for each type - making it ideal to bring pure magic OR physical damage (and in almost all cases it's vastly superior to just bring overwhelming physical damage). Don't worry, maybe you can have a buffbot caster - or just reload and respec for free with no downsides.  Hope you didn't want to roleplay each character having different social strengths and out of combat abilities - you never know when you're going to get dragged into an unskippable and unavoidable conversation that requires you to have high social stats to navigate successfully - but don't worry, you can just reload and respec to a social god, go and do it, and then respec back into being a thief or whatever!  While I am always in favor of respecs, making it completely free and without any downsides, at any point in the game, in a game that HEAVILY rewards specialization and defined roles, really rips apart any veneer of real player choice. It's not about going through a world, it just turns into a puzzle of deciding when to respec to automatically win one challenge and then respec again to beat the next.  There's also a wonderful modding community with a wide variety of intriguing mods to make the game harder/easier, add new classes, fix problems in the base game, add more monsters, and basically everything else to tailor your experience to be exactly as punishing or trivial as you want - but fortunately Larian knows best and ensured that a single mod disables all achievements because how dare those filthy modders try to alter their game!  The character interactions vary from hilariously terrible to genuinely interesting and were among the brightest points in the game; there is some excellent writing that does a lot to help you get into the head of each character (vengeance-driven elvish assassin, snarky egotistical undead, hardcore grizzled mercenary, etc) while allowing you to twist those personalities in ways that fit the character but align with your vision of them; the Elf is never going to be a chill person but you can turn her into a relentless hate-fueled machine of death who slaughters anyone who ever wronged her, a laser focused woman only concerned about the few people who truly deserve her vengeance and doesn't hurt others unnecessarily, or anything in between.  I especially enjoyed how each player character in coop can react to things differently and further their own storyline, but if you don't discuss it with your coop partner it can get pretty awkward at times, especially if they just happened to trigger a major plot event that you have no say in until after they aggro'd everything on the map. Or if you accidentally trigger a cutscene that you simply don't have the social or perk-based tools to handle appropriately. Or if one of you accidentally misclicks and aggros half the city.  The recent Definitive Edition update professes to make the execrable plot slightly better and 'rebalances' the game - by nerfing power combos into the ground and giving tiny buffs to skills that were comically bad before and are generally still comically bad now. Doesn't deal with any major design flaws, unfortunately, just dunks on SOME of the best combos while ignoring others and not actually giving a damn about underwhelming options.  This game definitely has heart and while I am forced to give it a thumbs down based on steam's binary system, in reality I would probably give it closer to a 5 or 6 out of 10. maybe as high as 7 if you're willing to overlook some of its flaws. It's not a TERRIBLE game by any means. But it's no Baldur's Gate or anything close - a lot of glossy paint over a rotting veneer, with a major subsection of the community among the more toxic and elitist individuals I've met in my time of online gaming and forum discussion. DoS2 is enough of an improvement over DoS1's horrific missteps that it gives me a little hope that DoS3 might actually be a genuinely good game, but the tripe of this Definitive Edition doesn't do a lot to give hope."
Nogan,125,24,2,April 2,Not Recommended,46.2,"I kept hearing this game being touted as the best RPG ever made, so I checked it out. Not to say that it's a bad game, because IT ISN'T, but I was disappointed. Seems that it was described that way by the sorts of people whose favorite aspect of ""RPGs"" is discovering new builds and squeezing the best possible numbers out of them. It actually functions very similarly to Skryrim in that way, as it exists as a sort of sandbox for players to experiment with builds while ignoring the story until they get bored and try a different one.  If you're looking for a game with a compelling story, I don't think you'll find it here. It's pretty forgettable and was obviously thrown in as an afterthought. Again, this is the sort of RPG built for metagamers. In the sake of allowing that openness, you aren't hampered in your endeavors by anything but the level of the enemies you encounter. For instance, Fort Joy is described as a ghetto where you're kept under thumb by a group of militant radicals, where the prisoners have set up their own gangs and attempt to run things under the radar. But you're never accosted by your jailors. You're never confronted by Gangs of New York inspired Griff. You just do your own thing and run around the fort like you own the place. It never imparts the sense of genuine strife.  If you're looking for a game with tight tactical combat, I don't think you'll find it here, either. Combat is turn based and off grid. Means characters have very little physical presence and everyone can just squeeze by each other. Also means that there's no real advantage to be gained from positioning. AoE spells fall where they may because everyone is rooted to the ground while its someone else's turn, and there aren't any good methods of herding or aggroing enemies to keep them still while your mage rains down powerful spells.  Speaking of spells, class abilities are pretty homogenized, so everybody gets powerful recovery, AoE, mobility, and debuffing options. Class identity has been sacrificed in the name of customization, which I'm sure many find appealing, though I personally find it detracts from the meat of the gameplay.  The last issues I have rest with itemization. All the equipment you find is based on item level, which is based on character level. The difference between items one level apart is significant. Equipment two or more levels below the current level of your character might as well not even exist. The damage you do and the damage you can take is almost entirely based on item level. It means that any equipment you find is going to be rendered useless in about an hour, which is frustrating. And more than that, the problem lies with ARMOR.  Armor is, by far, the single biggest issue with combat and levels in this game. Armor effectively stops characters from being effected by any number of the overpowered statuses. It stacks up and goes down like health as you do/take damage. Once you're armorless, you're defenseless against them. So why is this an issue? The amount of armor you can stack is heavily tied to the level of armor you're using. Because the level of armor the enemies use is tied to their level, it means that character level is the most important factor in deciding where you can go and what you can do. There's no cheating out unlikely victories against higher level encounters, because you have to smack each other until the armor goes away before you can actually influence combat in any reasonable way. This effectively means that the game holds your hand as it walks you to from encounter to encounter that you're currently allowed to beat. No strategy. No tactics. Just numbers.  All in all, it wasn't the sort of RPG that I was looking for. I don't think most of these points are negatives so much as they're descriptions of what to expect. The strategy you'll find in this game is derived from how you feel like building your character, rather than in the encounters themselves. Basically, it's ""do I want to make a stealth archer or tanky mage"" rather than ""there are multiple archers across that gap, how do I want to tackle this particular encounter"". I don't personally enjoy RPGs like that, so I didn't find a lot here that I cared for."
Squirmonkey,192,36,8,July 23,Not Recommended,94.6,"Wow. I played the Fort Joy section of this game, and I was blown away. The combat was excellent. The storytelling was immaculate. Not a bug or glitch in sight.  And then I finished the Fort Joy chapter, and you know what? Every other part of this game completely sucks. Plotlines that make no sense, or don't resolve in the right order. Massive ""open"" areas which have to be tackled in a specific order or else result in certain death. Nonsensical combat scaling which forces you to spend hours using the disgustingly-fiddly inventory manager every time you level up. A completely pointless crafting system, which I'm sure contains hundreds of recipes that there's no way to learn but will have you carrying dozens and dozens of ingredients you have no clue what to do with. Quests designed in such a way that I spent half my time on the wiki looking up what arcane unnanounced skill check I was failing. A combat system that shows everything it has to offer in the first few levels and then falls off thanks to poor scaling, a lack of new abilities, the exceptionally un-fun source mechanic, and abilities that straight up don't do what they're supposed to (I'm looking at you, Mad and Taunted).   I was really excited after the first chapter. However, after that chapter the game devolves into a total mess which I wanted to love and can't recommend."
Bob1004,149,54,4,"September 19, 2017",Not Recommended,43.3,"This game is maddening. But let's get the positives out of the way: The game has a great world and characters. I liked being part of the world. Magic is powerful and elemental combinations can be interesting. Normally I would consider this a good game and would heartily recommend it. It is a mechanically sound experience.  BUT  The game is a damned mess in execution. Bugs are ever present. And these are not graphical glitches. Quests conclude totally ignoring what you did in them. Not sure that it affects gameplay, but it is confusing to see it write the exact opposite of what you did into the journal.  But the biggest issue is that the game is unforgivably obtuse and lacks any structure in its story. I don't as much follow what is going on as stumble from one event to another, sometimes having dialogue options that I have no idea who it references or what is going on. There is absolutely no structure to the story. There are also nothing but vague hints on what are you supposed to do. This game made me rage quit an RPG, which has never happened before: After spending hours on the Nameless Island in front of a bloody gate that I have no idea how to open and only vague notions of where to proceed. This game explains nothing. Gives no hints where you are supposed to go or what to do. You just explore every corner of the map and occasionally things happen. I don't expect it to be a linear corridor, but I do expect story progression, not stumbling in the dark until something happens. I literally have no idea what am I supposed to do or where am I supposed to go. The journal itself is useless beyond recording (sometimes incorrectly) past events. It is absolutely possible to accidentally pass crucial plot details and have no idea what the bloody hell is going on. That is not 'freedom', it's bad story telling.  Also, I'm not invested in the actual story at all. You have to become Divine. Why? Because the game is called Divinity. This is just what Godwoken do on a Thursday I guess. Again, not sure because the story is lackluster or because I accidentally skipped half of the story by going into a cave.  Ultimately I'm not having fun. I'm increasingly confused and agitated by the game as it refuses to adhere to any structure. The opening was great, I had fun exploring the first islands, but everything is downhill from there. I wanted to like this, but when a game makes you yell profanities at the screen for 15 minutes, then it is no longer entertainment.  After playing this game, I can see that 'total freedom' is absolutely overrated and a terrible narrative device. Compare it to an Obsidian or Bioware RPG: Each is more restrictive and linear, but I have a grasp on what is going on, who the players are, etc. Hell, this game cannot properly remember that I choose one of their prebuilt characters, only adding to further confusion when it references events in dialogue that did not happen. Or when one character tells the other that it was not there somewhere where it absolutely was. Or when characters appear out of thin air with altered personality.  It is a mechanically sound narrative mess. And since I'm primarily interested in the narrative, I cannot with a good conscious recommend it."
Kabooozie,15,4,1,May 20,Not Recommended,90.2,"I enjoyed this game for about 100 hours, so it's hard to say I can't recommend it. It has many pros: -clever writing -great narration -a truly D&D experience where your abilities can interact with the world in interesting and unexpected ways -some truly difficult, satisfying combat  But. The game is imbalanced, and drags on way too long. There are intense difficulty spikes even on normal diffuculty where, despite being overleveled, encounters feel unfair. This happens especially at the beginning if you don't know exactly what order to do quests to gain XP. I once fought some level 2 frogs for an hour and a half and didn't get anything. Many of the systems are just obtuse and outdated. This game does not subscribe to modern, streamlined, meaningful design. There is so much of the game that just wastes your time."
KD6-3.7,31,4,0,"October 15, 2017",Not Recommended,133.3,"Is this a good game? Yes (if you like turn based RPG of course) Is this better than the first? I would say no.  If I had to summarize : +the game is beautiful, you can clearly see that the designers were inspired +the story of the firt act is really good   -the armor system is frustrating, since it encourages raw damage over control, at higher difficulty this really limits the number of good builds. A single point remaining in an armor (for you or your ennemy) can change the outcome of a combat, not really fun -for example ranger/sniper doesn't really work at higher difficulty (all ennemies have some sort of TP), and invocation is terrible -mages have basically to specialise in one scool to be efficient -two handed weapons is heavily favored for now, you can solo the game in tactical difficulty with a solo 2-handed warrior  -many things that worked in the first divinity original sin has been nerfed : crafting is more or less useless outside of runes, changing surfaces on the ground is sub-optimal (enemies like to put everything on fire, forget about poison and oil), etc  -initiative is only useful on one team number since there will be an alternance between your team and foes (hate the new system)  -the worst flaw of the game is the very weak act 3 (the last one) if you ask me (no spoil, but it is the worst of the three and the shortest) -act 3 has by far the most translation's errors of the three, it feels rushed (for example description in the place of the name of the object and name in the place of the description or two times the same sentences in dialogue, not really funny) -act 3 is also I think the one with the more bugs, at least it feels like it  So basically I am frustrated, it is quite a good game, but it feels not nearly as complete as the first. The end is rushed, the combat's mechanic is heavily damage oriented (forget about surfaces and such, it makes basically no damage and no control), and your life is basically useless, only armor really count (at least on tactical difficulty).  I don't know, it could have been so much better than I can't recommend it right now."
PanVanocka,131,4,1,May 15,Not Recommended,46.9,"First off, game is unstable and crashes relatively often. Be warned. While the game is evidently made by talented people with passion for their work, I did not enjoy it much. Audio/visual side of things, this game is gorgeous, and combat is fun and engaging, but can get a little tedious. Voice acting top notch. But the game on whole is a slow slog, with the most cliched high fantasy setting and dull story. Ye that allows for some funny scenarios, but it's not at all immersive and the world/map is so condensed and level scaled, that is similar to MMORPG only 50 times smaller. I mean you happen upon a ravaged caravan, and have to bring news to city guard 20 meters away, it's all silly, like they could not hear or see giant voidwoken worms attacking it. They should just do more maps and let them breathe a little and not filled them to the total brim with quest/secrets/enemies etc. Would improve exploring/adventure vibe. Item management is hellish and there is just so much fluff that gets in the way of doing the fun stuff."
Ghostwheel,60,17,1,"September 27, 2017",Not Recommended,8.6,"This is a very difficult game to review. It is great for what it is, but you really have to understand what kind of game it is first. I'm a huge fan of RPGs of all types, but I think this is the first one I've personally regretted purchasing. I have been playing since the 90's... have played every style except a legit D&D style game such as this. I thought Neverwinter Nights (which I loved)was legit D&D, but I can only surmise from this games success that I was wrong and this is just directed at those hardcore pencil and paper folks.       It is VERY slow moving. Forget that it's turn based, forget playing with 1 character, and forget rushing into ANY fight. It's slow - almost awkwardly so. I would say at least 90% of playing is dialogue play. There is very little combat, and I think this was on purpose. Combat is meant for playing with a full party - and even then it is VERY difficult to win without thoroughly understanding the mechanics. Unfortuantely, you don't get much practice to get familiar with them so that the fights are even enjoyable. I've wiped my entire party on every fight except the Voidwoken(overgrown maggots). I just cannot bring myself to put this on easy difficulty.       Unfortunately, the dialogue and how the story was delivered wasn't enough to keep me playing. And even then, I'd say the story telling is mediocre at best. It's simply not compelling enough to keep at it. I tried playing several times before I just got frustrated, read similar reviews, got bored then just uninstalled. It is a beautiful game with a lot of attention to detail, however, it just doesn't do enough to keep your normal RPG guy playing. For this reason, I'm going to have to go with a ""Do not recommend"" on Steam. Very sad."

NaniCat,124,29,8,February 27,Not Recommended,264.0,"I've played this game a good bit, and while on some levels I enjoy it. I think the reality of it is that I WANT to enjoy it far more than I do. The game has a rich environment, and great game feel that takes me back to the 'good ole' days' of playing baldurs gate and icewind dale and the like, however... there's some seriously massive problems with the game; Namely, Balance and Diversity.  When I say Balance, the game has been scaled horribly, a good example is warfare, being... the end all be all for literally any physical damaging characters, INCLUDING necromancer. playing a rogue? max warfare, playing a ranger? yup... max warfare... All of this becomes even more problematic when you include issues with the other big problem; Armour and Resistances.  The twist of the knife is that they seperated armour into magic armour, and physical armour; meaning that enemies (and players) essentially have 3 health pools, while different effects are resisted by different armor pools, these pools must be diminished to get into the juicy meat of the quintessential problem. not only is magic simply inherently worse because of the otherwise RANDOM elemental resistances enemies have, meaning that your fire mage may end up useless in some situations, your melee and physical damage dealers will encounter almost no issues (only one is an otherwise exploitative style 'bug' (feature?) of a few key enemies using an evasive aura that gives them and all their allies a 90% chance to dodge, it's quite stupid).  So, this means two things, A. having a split damage type group means you're effectively doubling your enemies health/armour pools, and B. many builds are completely dysfunctional because of poor scaling mechanics and skill sets affecting your abilities in nonsense ways, The witch is a great example of this ( a starting character class that is little more than a noob trap) as daggers scale with finesse, necromancer abilities scale with intelligence, and all their physical damage scales with... warfare.   For the more than 200 hours i've played in this game, I can say I enjoyed some of the game, but I can also say that due to bugs, poor game design for multiplayer co-op (I laid on the ground dead due to a bug while the end of the game cutscene went for my friend and i got to see none of it, it was an absolutely awful experience). I WANT TO LOVE THIS GAME, but sadly, it needs a serious rework of the fundamental principles that it's based on before it could potentially be any actual good."

Pros: -Story telling (mainly sidequests) and interactions in the team you assemble (and personal quests of 6 premade characters) are SO much better than in first game, there are a lot of quests and less generic npc's but... -Both character creator and later thanks to readily available respec option you can build any character you want, in this aspect the game is bit more open minded than first one but... -Visually the game is pretty, same with music though...  Cons: -... that same storytelling has pacing problems. There are 5 chapters and with ending of 4th act it suddenly dies in my opinion. SPOILER It's typical ""you almost got the objective of the story to be snatched from your hands"" and you're thrown into another bug map with urgency that world is going to hell... but at the same take your time and go about exploring another map. -...but while you have a lot of leeway on how to build your character (and 3 companions)  I simply hate, HATE how suddenly Abilities were separated into Combat and Civil with points to the second being scarcely given out so you can't really have a Civily oriented character (and how Persuation is absolutely NEEDED for any interesting outcome) and Combat abilities being such a god damn MESS that your character you want to build for SCOUNDREL will be better off first  maxing out WARFRARE to deal more damage... (not to mention choosing perk, something I couldn't wait for in first game,  is just choosing an option which does NOT suck) -Combat and overall difficulty is a f***ing joke, not even taking in to the account the bonuses/debuffs to health/armor they present. As an example: In 5th act there is a small boss fight with one character specific quest, there is the boss and 6'ish minions Explorer - my level 20 characters equipped fully with Divines and Unique items steamrolled the fight so hard it's not even funny, abilities of enemies were hardly used and they just walked up to me to get themselves killed. Classic - By the time it my 1st character could move 1 character was already dead, one was about to join him and other 2 were heavily debuffed... There is a difference between AI is braindead  at half health and AI is going to bury you under the amount of debuffs and status effects before it's your turn. But maybe it's just me. -Item generator in this game is absolute garbage. If you don't fancy multiclassing your party (which the game actively encourages to the point it feels you're being pushed into it) finding ANYTHING that will suit your characters build is a god damn MIRACLE, oh and that nice item you DID find/buy? You throw it out the bloody window cause next level it is GARBAGE and crafting is... just there. I think this game has one ot THE worst item scalings I EVER played. -Ending is trash. It's on the level of pre-dlc Mass Effect 3 to me with an added option that no matter what you do everybody is ♥♥♥♥ed (Rivellon) or your companions/npc are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unhappy about your choice (and it's presented in a way as if it's your fault and you should've chosen better...) not to mention a lot of last fight reveals (the fight itself is  pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥tery) are just a joke...   TL;DR - game in MY opinion upgrades a lot of stuff upon first game but simply f***s up the stuff that was actually pretty good in first one. If you have a question about something this review didn't cover or want to expand comment, also this is my marginal opinion so take it with a grain of salt."
HUcast,176,3,0,"October 20, 2017",Not Recommended,121.8,"Of all the content in this game, the graphical improvements and whathave you, I cannot recommend it. While the combat and stats are simplified and dumbed down, that alone wouldn't be enough for me to give the game a negative review. The key problem for me is the sheer unlikabilty of virtually every character in the game. They don't feel like people at all, none of them seem to have any real issues they care about, even the NPCs with you that have life changing events over their heads give up on them with a single easy persuasion check. It doesn't help either that half of the NPCs you meet seem to be smug and insulting of the party, not in a funny way either, but in a ""Hey guys look at this cool guy who'll guide you through the game"" kind of way. It doesn't help that a massive number of characters are introduced by showing you up in text, such as putting a knife to your throat or invading your space in some other way. In short, the npcs in this game seem to drive it instead of the players, and many seem to have a self important mary sue vibe. It really killed my ability to get in to the game as a whole."
Mendhak,487,7,0,"November 8, 2017",Not Recommended,146.8,"Backed as part of the Kickstarter campaign, had been hoping for more of what made the first D:OS memorable.  Unfortunately for me this isn't what D:OS2 was like, it was more serious and the joviality of the first was gone, giving it a somewhat generic feel.  I also wasn't a fan of the 'refined' surface mechanic - I realized this when I found myself standing in a 'cursed electrified blood cloud', it was now dancing into the realm of ridiculous.  It was similar for the additional source mechanic, it just didn't click with me - towards the middle of the game, the combat began to feel like a chore.    The serious tone of the game made the towns and cities completely dull.  And while a great amount of detail had been paid to the beginning of the game, the middle and ending of the game as well as the story felt a bit rushed and loose in terms of focus; as did certain quests, which seemed to be completely missing any context or information.    Some parts are pretty good though - the soundtrack is memorable, a bit broodier and darker than the first, though I am listening to it on repeat now and hoping to buy it soon.  There are plenty of spells to pick and choose from, though it is hampered by the enforced AP limit.  The story was... just-ok, if a bit tedious.  Performance wise, I was getting a steady 120+ fps at most places.  The artwork and level design are just great - there's a lot of detail in every place you visit.  So there was enough to somewhat keep the interest going for the sake of finishing.    Overall - decent but not seeing the accolades, good art and music carrying a dull story.  It didn't bring back the charm of D:OS, so if I were speaking to my past self, would not have recommended."
Proteus,132,11,1,"October 6, 2017",Not Recommended,88.2,"(Spoiler-free, no worries)  I'm not a big review writer, but after finishing this game I feel like the people must know.  To begin, I'd like to say this game's lore and concept are fantastic, I would recommend it fully for those things. There are, however, a ton of gameplay mechanics that are eh and make fights tedious and unfun, but those can easily be overlooked if you really play for the story. No, those aren't the issue.  The bugs are the problem. Countless, mindblowing, ridiculous bugs. I feel like I paid for an early access game, but it's not in early access anymore, and I bought it full ♥♥♥♥ing price. You have no idea how many odd things I've had happen. I'm not talking about bugs that you notice right away and just reload 5 minutes ago to fix-kinda thing, not wall clipping sillyness (Though there's some of that as well).  I'm talking:  -""Oh look that npc never prompted me for his quest so now I'm locked from one of the things that had me most curious and to fix that I'd have to reload 20-30 hours of gameplay ago"",  -""Oh look I somehow have a 5th party member when the limit is meant to be 4, but that 5th npc can't really act and is attacked by all allied npcs, and there's no way to get rid of it"".  -""Oh look because I used another one of the game's many options of approach (which is a really cool thing in theory) the story's all ♥♥♥♥ing backwards"" -""Oh look I killed the boss before he could transform into his ""true"" form, removing the discussion prompt that I'm supposed to get from finishing that, guess I ain't finding out what happens next with that...""  Last but not least: I just finished the final fight, but my main character died right before and I didn't get to resurect him, so the other characters get the final choices in the game...okay that's fine I guess...  BUT WAIT! Then, after the cinematic regarding that choice, there's only my main character left and I guess there's a bit of game left to play (new game+ kinda thing, perhaps?) but since he died in the last fight and all the other party members are gone, I get a game over prompt, allowing me to either load a previous save (before the final fight) OR just go to main menu.   TL;DR: Game's story's pretty good. Mechanics are nothing revolutionary, sometimes annoying but mostly bearable, bugs completely ruin immersion and make me not recommend the game in it's current state."
bogbrush3,52,55,13,"November 5, 2017",Not Recommended,117.2,"There are a lot of people that rave about this game, and to be fair there are a lot of positives to it. The combat is very satisfying, the writing is good and the storyline is alright. I like the character creation and customisation through the game, and the ability to customise the Origins characters is a really good addition.   However, none of that is enough to make up for the hours you will spend pixel hunting, reading through online walkthroughs and sifting through inventory screens with no search function and the most awkward 'sort by' system imaginable. There is a skill you learn to be able to see ghosts, but it is hardly ever hinted when you need to use it (even to finish quests), and at one point you even need to use it to see levers which is literally never mentioned and never happens again in the entire game. The questlog is equally illogical, and essentially tells you what you have already done without giving you any idea where to go next, and the waypoints on the map seem like they were put in the game by someone who has not read the plot. Sometimes, you are encouraged to explore with amazing loot as rewards, but other times without any notification at all you can go too far and come back to a town to find half the people dead and quests uncompleteable. In fact, I only found out those people should have been alive because I read it on an internet walkthrough after the fact.  A lot of people praise this game as a throwback to the golden age of RPGs in the 90s and early 2000s, and I get that. But for me, some aspects of gaming have moved on - I dont want to walk around in circles looking for an item that no longer exists because I chose the wrong option in dialogue 3 weeks ago and the quest didnt update. What specifically irks me is that before I bought the game I researched it, and in an interview one of the devs claimed they had made it all but impossible to miss quests by going the wrong way or doing the wrong thing - and in my opinion that is just bull****.  There are people that will mistake this frustration for the game being difficult - it isn't. Once you get a hang of the game mechaincs and level up enough to get decent skills there are very few fights that pose any kind of threat even on the hardest difficulty. What it is is time-consuming, frustrating and illogical unless you want to follow the one-dimensional path the game devs set out for you into a trap that is obvious from the middle of act two, if not earlier.  In my opinion you should just watch a playthrough on Youtube instead of buying it, and if after that you still are interested at least wait until it is on sale - because you are going to need that money to buy a new screen after you smash a hole in your old one."
chris,80,11,0,"December 28, 2017",Not Recommended,65.4,"This game has so many bugs.  It is such an awesome game, but talking to some people causes you to steal items, some areas make as though you are blinded, you are unable to target characters when standing on some staircases, a random explosion could screw up follow up dialogue once an enemy is defeated causing the enemy to just stand there with zero hit points, I don't know how many times state has been lost in my dialogue with NPCs (I have already talked to them but for some reason I talk to them again and it's reset again, I'm not changing faces when this happens).  It's a really nice RPG game and the story is great... Just so many bugs. It's infuriating.  I would only recommend this game once they have patched the major bugs."
takh01,141,22,3,January 25,Not Recommended,26.3,"This game is not for me. I get that some people love it, and it does have some unique aspects. But I do not like being forced into doing most if not all side quests just to be able to progress. In some of the Witcher games, and Fallout I have done a majority of the side quests, but that is because I choose to, not because I have to. In this game if I do not do the side quests, I can simply not progress through the main content due to being too low level. Seems every step of the main story progressions saw me having to go back and complete side quests so I had a chance of being able to progress.  If you are someone that loves doing all the side quests, then this game may well be a game you will enjoy, but if you are someone that likes just pushing through the main story line, I can not recommend this game."
vegan meth,329,18,0,"September 23, 2017",Not Recommended,103.5,"This is the best concept for an RPG ever made in my opinion. However I can not recommend it due to it being largely unfinished. It follows the same trend of Tyrrany in that the beginning of the game is vast and interesting, but once you get to the final acts everything falls apart. Constantly being forced to reload the game due to conversations bugging out, quests bugging out, combat turns bugging out, and pretty much anything else you can imagine just not working at all completely ruins the great writing and amazing gameplay mechanics. Have a character with high persuasion? Oh that is your main character? Too bad. Random peons in your group will constantly be addressed for major dialogue options, forcing you to fail the conversation, and either reload the game or just be forced to kill all of the npcs. There was even a time during one of the hardest fights in the game where I won the fight with 200 hp remaining on my final living character after an hour long fight, just to have the game bug out and prevent any further action. An hour long epic battle reduced to pointlessness. You can expect this to happen constantly. This game is worth $20 max. It isn't a very impressive display of modern technology either, so there is no reason not to wait for it to go on sale."
dragonheck,120,6,1,April 13,Not Recommended,41.2,I am liking the game but the thing that makes me dis it is the sheer fact that they still have not corrected the issue of no buyback option unless you use a controller which is miffing me because its the game saying you payed this money but you dont get all of the features because u did get a controller i hate being forced to change my controls just  for a simple feature
mech,203,6,0,"October 13, 2017",Not Recommended,4.8,"Hmm... I really liked the first one and expected to like this one too, but something just feels off about it despite the obvious depth and quality and the adorable quirky characters.  I don't like how it controls at all. It's so easy to misclick and steal stuff or attack someone you didn't mean to or make the characters walk straight through the fire when you obviously didn't mean to either. I am also not a fan of the first area being overloaded with boss encounters. They tend to produce very random fights that lead to save scumming.   In fact, most of the encounters seem to be designed around save scumming and cheesy strategies, particularly in the ""Tactician"" mode. They are straight up unbeatable unless you know exactly what to expect from the encounter and you do things like precast spells, position your characters in a certain way for that specific encounter or put barrels around the area where you know the enemy is going to appear *before* you trigger it.  But what I really hate is the armor system. Every character has two armor bars, magical and physical. They are pretty much additional HP bars that absorb damage from physical and magical attacks correspondingly before you can affect the actual HP. This is fine on its own, however you can't apply any physical effects (stuns, knockdowns) while the target still has some physical armor and you can't apply any magical effects (slowed, burning etc.) while the target still has magical armor.  What that means is that for a good part of the fight you effectively can't use any skills and are forced to stick to basic attacks until the armor is gone. This system is easily the least fun armor system I've ever seen in an RPG."
Celador,228,35,4,April 10,Not Recommended,151.8,"Took me a while to finish the game but i finally did it.   I have 150 hours in game and that's just one playthrough with Fane on a tactician difficulty while trying my best to complete everything, discover all quests, secrets, achievements and locations.   I have started playing on release and finished the game on the latest patch and i can say that it remains one of the most bug ridden games i have ever encountered on par with Fallout and Elder Scrolls.   In every act there are numerous quests which do no close or register upon completion correctly. There are broken npc's which do not progress quests correctly or even board your ship when they supposed to. Broken items which do no have any description or can't be used or have broken interactions. Broken achievements. Missing sounds and dialogues. Dead npc's reappearing later on or being addressed is if they are alive or alive npc's appearing dead. Bugged, broken, missing, wrong - that's the current state of the game. Even one of the endings for Fane was broken which is simply unacceptable and should be the very least that they could've fixed by now. Not to mention chat which never worked since the release.    What's even worse is that every bug has been documented both on larian and steam forums, there are threads upon threads detailing and repeating almost all of the bugs i have encountered in the game and some of the threads are from 2016 and 2017.   While the game has amazing graphics, music, good story, a lot of choices, puzzles and genuinely addictive gameplay - the lack of QA is truly astonishing.   I realize that partially it's my own fault since im a completionist and prefer to explore every nook and cranny and up until the ending i was still going to write a positive review but when i was unable to use the ending that i wanted all along i decided that it was enough. Game clearly needs even more polishing."

You cant experience a game when some 50% of quest legit wont update, advance,and complete. Anyone who owns this game that reads this knows exactly what Im talking about. Its frustrating being locked out on valuable experience to level up because a quest wont complete. And to make matters worse when you advance through the main quest line you auto fail any quest that wouldnt finish even though you did them! This IS an early access game I dont care what anyone tells me."
FBWilson,115,16,4,July 16,Not Recommended,68.0,"This is like Divinity 1 but with some aspects much better and some aspects much worse. The combat is good and I like the addition of source points even if it makes some skills which you could use freely in the first game require additional resources to use.  HOWEVER, the biggest problem with the game is that it cheats. I don't mean it's hard, because it isn't always too hard. What I  mean is the game will go out of its way to put you at a ridiculous disadvantage, even if it means breaking it's own rules. Enemies will often have more health or armor than their level or stats should allow and will often get advantages such as extra AP and impossible ability cooldowns. this gets really annoying when you watch an enemy run at your mage from 30 feet away before attacking them three times (at 2 AP cost each). This scenario isn't even uncommon. What's worse is when the game spawns extra enemies in mid-battle. This wouldn't be a problem if there were any warning that this was going to happen but that's never the case because the game will often spawn in several enemies at a time and give them each a turn immediately. This can happen multiple times per battle meaning that, completely out of your control, a bunch of enemies spawned in and nuked you. This leads many fights to feel like the Braccus Rex fight from the first game, not hard but stupidly unfair for no good reason. I imagine this was the developers way to try and combat save scumming but what ends up happening is you need to save scum more simply because the game expects you to know in advance what its going to do. This gets so bad that I've seen entire fights go by without even moving: The enemy will get first turn, summon baddies and stun the entire party, making you helpless as the others pick you off one by one. This is bad fight design.  All in all, I like this game but am extremely disappointed in the way its encounters were designed. I don't want fights to be easy but I want to know that the enemies are playing by the same rules I'm confined to or at least similar ones."

While I have to admit the scale of DOS2 is absolutely amazing, I've never played a game that is so difficult to get started with.  The difficulty is punishing even if you follow advice from the internet and fellow players.  I'm definitely one for a challenge but it get tiresome getting your butt kicked everytime you into an enemy.  It's as if you can never take a deep breath and relax because around the corner is just yet another group of enemies that turn you into mince meat before you get to your second turn started.  I'm a life-long, old school player of RPGs going back to the old Might and Magic and Ultima days and I've ever encourntered a game like this that so well done yet so frustrating.  I'd love to recommend it but I simply can't.  Perhaps in a few months I'll return to it since I'm a glutton for punishment and never like to let a game get the better of me.

DD,64,9,3,March 15,Not Recommended,426.7,"i played the former title, DOS EE for 570 hours in a row. That is the most enjoyable RPG i've ever played.  i started this DOS2 with very high expectation, but i'm dissapointed.  XP income is very restricted while you deaperately need appropriate level to win the battle. if you are underleveled, you can't kill just one enemy(not Boss) with your full four members in one round, while single enemy character(not Boss,again) easily kill your member in just one round. OK,OK, i know creative strategy and smart use of skills are needed to win the battle in this game. But it's almost impossible when you are underleveled in the first place.  My memorable first play stopped at the forced, scripted battle between 1st and 2nd chapter.i had to abandon the Save. In second play, i had to gather all the XPs available to win the coming forced battle.  i had to kill even the daramatically rescued NPCs after i get their thanks and quest XP rewards... when i left the first island, 80% of the population became corpse for my survival at the unavoidable battle. This is XP hunting slaughter, not role playing game...  Combat system is a total failure, i think. There're so many complicated debuff skills and terrain control skills, but NONE OF THEM WORKS AS LONG AS ENEMY HAS ARMOUR. And when you reduce their armour to zero, IT'S MUCH FASTER DIRECTLY ATTACK THEIR HP THAN WASTING YOUR ACTION FOR DEBUFFING.  There're so many skills and spells, but in combat all you have to do is same. Always attack with highest damage -expectable way.  In DOS EE, all combat are never the same depending on what tactics you selected. But in DOS2, all combat looks the same while selectable choices are too many. Far less enjoyable than the former title. For example, is there any meaning for two types of fire(normal and cursed) exists? While most enemy gets no damage with armour or elegantly teleport or fly to avoid them?  Many bugs still remain. You can recruit many NPCs to your mother ship for utility, but some of them never moves to your ship, just dissapear(fletcher and the salvaging boy ,for example)  Companion quest system is also annoying. When i talk to quest-related NPCs, companion A interrups to conversation and kill the NPC, so companion B's quest stops and can't be finished.(Sebile is the worst.she spoils the red lizard and Ifan's quests) Yes,it's avoidable through the dialogue IF YOU KNOW IT HAPPEN. Of course I didn't know it in my first play, so i had to abandone my play and load the data.What do you call it but annoying?  Crafting system is garbage. Don't bother to pick up and carry materials for crafting. You never use them. In DOS EE, crafted weapons are overpowered, i admit. But in DOS2, crafting has almost no purpose and meaning.Why goes extreme to extreme?  90% of the people in DOS2 prefer blunt weapons. You can get only hammer, mace, axes for your two-handed weapon expert. If you luckily find some, they are far too weaker than blunts. I WANT TO USE TWO-HANDED SWORD! WHY NOBODY SELLS THEM?  i hope DOS3 will be more evaluated and well-balanced one.  Oh, lastly to the players who has interest to this game via youtube or any oher movies. MOST OF THE FEATS INTRODUCED IN THEM OR WIKI NEVER AVAILABLE. Seems latest patch killed these super-play."
RyanVodka,63,19,0,"September 28, 2017",Not Recommended,130.8,"Great game ruined by a flawed combat system.  I really wanted to like this game. The majority of what is there is top notch, but the double armor system drags the whole thing down. The way combat is designed forces you to abandon creative team builds in favor of either stacked melee or stacked caster teams.   I think the team imagined that allowing any character to learn any skill would encourage creative and interesting builds. Unfortunately it ends up doing the opposite. Nearly every enemy is designed to be able to defend against jack of all trades characters.   I understand that the enemies are weighted one side over the other either being more armored in physical than magical or vice versa, but It is very frustrating when its your turn and the character you are using is nearly useless because they are just going to end up chipping away at armor pool of the opposing armor type or simply being a buff bot for your other character. All you can think about is that you would have killed that character if you wouldnt have tried to have a diverse team build."
przemekk834a,101,32,11,July 30,Not Recommended,384.7,"Well, after playing this game a lot I decided to write a review (although I do not usually do it) and give it negative score, although I must admit that it's maybe a bit too harsh. This game has its qualities. Especially on the arts side (music, graphics, the world design, etc. ) it's simply marvelous. It also has deep, complex combat system, that in theory looks awesome. But not in practice -- more on this below.  Many criticisms of this game boil down to simple statement: Explorer mode is much too easy, but Classic mode is way too hard. There is a lack of ""sweet spot"" in difficulty between the two. But I do not think this is really the problem. I've beaten it at Classic and got as much fun as frustration and annoyance during that. So there isn't a problem with difficulty, but rather irritating game design mistakes the developers made. A few examples:  - The AI cheats and certain mechanics are unfair. For example, there is a Charm spell which makes enemies to fight on your side for short time - but enemies also can use it on you. When enemy charms you, AI takes away the control from you over your character but if you charm the enemy, the game will not give you the control over them. And the AI behavior differs. Charmed enemy characters frequently just skip turns or flee, while your characters will either attack your party, or senselessly waste your resources (potions, scrolls, SP). This is obvious cheating. Similar problem is with Taunt ability.  - The game tries extremely hard to be ""physical"" in restricting your casting and ranged abilities. The target must be in sight, the path must not be interrupted, etc. This looks cool on paper, but really leads only to some tedious gameplay. Isometric perspective is not convenient to judge spatial relations like this with required precision and you constantly are forced to adjust your position by trial and error - but every movement costs action points. So you must frequently save and reload if movement result is not right. Basically the only effect on gameplay of this ""cool mechanics"" is forcing save/reload scumming. ""The Pawn"" talent fixes it, but consumes one talent slot which are very few. This should be enabled by default. In addition to the above, terrain navmeshes are buggy and often the game thinks the path is blocked although visually it is not.   - This game loves to give unpleasant surprises to the player. A conversation with some innocently looking NPC often leads to a fight with half dozen guys who appear just out of nowhere. Solution - save, reload, cheese. Position your team away, send one to talk, during conversation teleport him back, finish conversation - now you have fight started on your terms. Definitely doable but extremely anticlimatic and immersion breaking.  - Teleportation is OP and too easily spammable. This leads to irritating situations when you waste time to position tactically your team, but enemy AI just decides to spam Nether Swap / Teleportation and shuffle you around so that you are in deep sh*t again.   - So called ""diablo loot system"" with gear leveling - everyone seems to hate it but game devs still push it into their games with no reason. Forces you to replace your gear every level or two. No way to upgrade.  - Not much sense of progress of your characters. You level up, but meet higher level enemies constantly and you are always a pushover, unless you find adequate gear for your level. Source magic is totally underwhelming - except ""Dome of protection"" and some high-tier spells that you can get only near the end. You never feel like a powerful Sourcerer you're supposed to be, but just some weakling trying to survive.  - Too hard, unbalanced fights are being offset by cheesy countermeasures like ""Dome of protection"" mentioned above or resurrection during battle. Resurrection scrolls are prohibitively expensive in the beginning and very cheap near the end. You can easily stock up on dozens of them and with help of ""Morning person"" talent make yourself almost immortal.   - Many UI problems and omissions. Movement of your team during map exploration is terribly slow - there is no ""fast mode"" like in PoE games. Chaining / unchaining by dragging portraits is awkward - having a ""chain/unchain all"" button would be nice, but there is no one. Inventory management sucks (as in all games in this genre), with so much gear management required it is a major hassle. Lack of ""sneak/unsneak all"" command. Edge panning is triggered even when you are using scrollbar in the inventory. No way to list inventory by name (how the hell that blackroot plant looked like?).   - In a game which forces you to save scum and reload all the time, you will often see the loading screen. In in this case it is absolutely terrible. Even longer than in PoE, and although does not appear during map exploration (full map is loaded), frequent reloading due to trial & error gameplay will make you hate the loading screen very quickly.  I could list a lot more issues, in fact there are tens of them and this review would be very long. Each of them separately is not that big, but as a whole they generate a lot of annoyance and you start to lose patience after a while. And this game is very long. Normally that would be a good thing. Content creators did a fantastic job, preparing so much amazing content. This game is worth its price just because of that. But what is the use of it all if playing the game gets frustrating and tiresome after some time spent with it?  So why am I NOT recommending this game?

There was multiple time where we would engage in combat and I would get stunned (no big deal) then right before my turn I would get knocked down, then get petrified. I would be unable to actually take a turn sometimes throughout the entire encounter. Combat like that where the player has ZERO control throughout an encounter destroys the gameplay.   Other gripe is with the camera and theft functionality, you are in the town and want to talk to an NPC but as you go to click on the NPC they move and you end up stealing a stick. Now youre left to deal with the guards and possibly having to reload."

Pelmaleon,38,49,1,"September 20, 2017",Not Recommended,64.8,"One thumb up, one thumb down (mixed review)  Pros: Really good atmosphere, art, voice acting, writing, music, and charm.  Cons: Terrible design choices in the new armor system (0% crowd control or status affliction chance while armor is up and 100% chance while armor is down) - makes encounter solutions incredibly repetitive and thus fairly boring, as they are too easy to ""solve"" via chained, 100% success rate crowd control. Also, on tactician there are not more enemies, but instead enemies just get huge boosts to their stats (armor included), making fun, hybrid parties bad, pushing you to use a more-repetitive either all physical or all magical party. The first Divinity Original Sin also had more chance involved (hit/miss chance for both attacks and crowd control), which this sequel pretty much eliminated, which makes fights very snowbally and predictable (and thus somewhat boring) towards the mid to end portions of the fight.  Poor, lazy loot design choice as every level up your lower level equipment becomes extremely outclassed by current level equipment found by tediously going to merchants and buying their newly updated wares. Also, loot attributes are randomized on most equipment so loot while adventuring feels way less special and lovable as you ditch them frequently for current-level loot with higher numbers (feels like Diablo 3 or Borderlands - games with the same lazy, constant slow-drip dopamine design choice).  Only 4 action points without a way to increase them (unless using OP lone wolf), makes fights much less tactical compared to the first Divinity: Original Sin 1 in which you slowly increased your action points as the game progressed, allowing fun combos. In this game you will use your most powerful skills/spells at the start of almost every single fight and then your second most powerful skills in the second round. Also, because action points are more sparse, scrolls and potions are used less frequently as they take precious action points away from using the aforementioned most powerful skills/spells. It makes the combat much more repetitive than the first Divinity: Original Sin.  Initiative system is botched. The turn order is now a round robin system as enemies always get a turn in between your characters, no matter how high your or their initiatives are. This makes fun multiple character combos less possible as enemies will often move or teleport before you have a chance to perform the full combo. Example: one character casts rain on the floor, enemy moves out of the water, and your second character can no longer electrocute the water with a lightning spell.  Stats are dumbed-down. Google Divinity:OS 1's stats and then Divinity:OS 2's stats and see the difference for yourself.  Small selection of damage-dealing magic spells (with many of them locked behind the anti-fun source system which forces you to spend a few and far between source points to use them).  Conclusion: If you liked the first Divinity Original Sin you will probably enjoy this one as well, even though most combat mechanics were changed for the worse. If you are looking for a superb, deep crpg experience similar to the past greats like Baldur's Gate, you may be disappointed."

Daemone Isos,181,39,33,September 6,Not Recommended,516.1,"I wanted to like this, but I did not.  I respect the enthusiasm of the people who enjoy it, but I have to admit that I was disappointed.  There were two related major design decisions that combined to take the fun out of the game for me.    The first was the general fussiness of many of the quests.  They were very particular in how they could be progressed, and that frequently led to either failure to continue, or a great deal of (unenjoyable) trial and error, or alt-tabbing to the wiki.  Each of these outcomes spoiled the immersion and momentum of the roleplaying.  The related design decision was the general absense of clear direction.  I truly respect this idea, but it poses high hurdles for implementation.  Combined with the general freedom to explore, it led me to random places on the map, with a nice open-world feel.  The problem was that I stumbled into heavily scripted quest areas which could not progress due to the first issue above.  For example, I fight a tough group of guardians, and suddenly nothing happens.  Apparently, those guardians are for some later part of the main quest, but the game gives me no clue or context about what is going on.  The quest logs sometimes make notes reminding me of people I have met and things I have seen, but no clues to follow.  So appearing to be dead-ended someplace interesting, I fall back on the wiki, to find out that this is the scene of a major scripted encounter that I have not yet triggered.  It feels deflating.  No, I don't want to use the wiki (aka spoiler bucket).  But arriving at a grand stage before the production starts is a drag.  It feels pointless.  And honestly, backtracking to some other (undefined) location to get back on the path that the quest doesn't point me to seems far too random.  To be explicit, wandering should yield encounters, not prevent them.  This process was confusing in Act I, frustrating in Act 2, and terminal in Act 3.  I wish the best to the development team, but I can't get excited to finish the game."
WinterBit,477,3,0,"October 9, 2017",Not Recommended,48.2,"The game is fun and great, until you leave the first island.   Once you leave Fort Joy, the games quality takes a sharp nosedive as it starts throwing encounters at you way out of your league without a warning unless you notice a single corpse laying on the ground and conjecture there might be enemies that will be spawned on you. Then there are so many glitches in the game it's extremely frustrating, such as the game straight up lying to you on who actually goes next in a turn based system. Such as MC, Party member #2, then #3, then #1, oh but wait, the boss gets a turn not shown on the UI and kills two of your party members because ""Didn't expect that did you?"". Then there's the extreme ramp in difficulty and scaling which puts MMO's to shame, from levels 1-10 you're increasing your damage by two or three points every level, but once enemies start hitting 11 and 12, their damage skyrockets by a hundred points.  The difficulty is all over the place as well. You can easily take on a 4v4 hidden hero encounter at level 9, while all the other enemies are level 12, and auto-revive into stronger versions with relative ease and tactics. But you talk to the wrong person, they forcefully initiate a fight 4v1, summon a monster in the middle of your entire team, and deals enough damage to OHKO your party members with a basic melee, and can opportunity attack. So you just fought a hidden boss encounter at level 9 and had a tough time but did eventually win it, and now you're getting OHKO'd by a simple minion a single character can summon multiple of?  It's fun, but manually save every three to four minutes, before you talk to anyone, before you walk into unknown territory, and after every single fight. The games autosave does a rather poor job of autosaving, and will make you lose hours of progress because ""Oh you talked to this person and didn't know it was going to be a fight."" There are a lot of forced encounters, save often, know what you're getting into before you get this game and learn it will throw artificial difficulty at you."
Geralt of Rivia,116,3,0,"October 9, 2017",Not Recommended,72.1,"A potentially great RPG with solid fundamental mechanics, which is currently lacking polish and quality of life features and that can make it an extremely frustrating experience. This is mind boggling considering how long it was in early access. Below you can see just some of the issues which can infuriate you. When/if the devs fix these, I'll happily recommend the game to every RPG fan.  1.Whenever I start the game, it resets my controls. Every. Single. Time.  2.Inventory management is clumsy AF. You can't move around multiple items and that's a royal pain the♥♥♥♥♥ which is only exacerbated by the fact that each of the characters in your party has their own inventory and they can't use consumables or gold from eachother unless you manually transfer it between them. Might work in co-op, but it sucks in single-player.  3.Civil skills are character-specific instead of party wide. So you may have pumped a bunch of points into persuasion for 1 of you characters, but if you don't specifically click on them to initiate conversation, it'll be wasted as the game will only check the persuasion skill of the char who started dialog. This is made even worse when NPCs start the conversation, because then you have no control over which character will be involved. Another example is with the bartering skill. Since traders only look at the skill of the char talking to them, they'll have worse prices for everyone else. So you only have to pick up items with your barter guy, unless you want to either be screwed with the prices or manually transfer every single item one at a ♥♥♥♥ing time between chars. Again, might work in co-op but it's horrible in SP.  4.Crafting screen doesn't give you any information about the items so you don't know if you want to craft them or not. How much does a medium healing potion heal? Is a primitive harpoon ranged or melee? WTF is a glowing idol of rebirth? No clue.  5.Autosaves only happen once when you stumble onto an area where the game thinks you might die. But if you wander off and only run into the encounter later, you won't be covered. Or if you accidentally click on a 0 value spoon because the NPC you wanted to talk to moved and now everyone hates your dirty, thieveing guts and you thought ""damn, i should reload"" - well, your last save may be an hour ago. It should have autosaves on area changes and timed every 5-10 minutes in addition to the encounter specific ones.  6.Everything that can be used directly in some way gets tossed on your quickbar as soon as you pick it up, cluttering the ♥♥♥♥ out of your life. Scrolls, potions, skills, booze, ♥♥♥♥ing bedrolls - everything."
Maud'Dib,15,3,0,May 8,Not Recommended,62.3,"I was really disappointed with this game. I really wanted to like it, but my frustration came down to 2 issues:  1) Randomness of elemental surfaces  This is supposed to be a strategic, tactical game, but the experience is completely marred by the randomness of the elemental surfaces. You can carefully position units and use spells to create surfaces only to have enemies randomly drop cursed surfaces that overwrite everything else are very difficult to remove.  Overall, it's difficult to prepare for a battle or try various tactics when the surfaces are so random and difficult to control. The game designers seem to love the surfaces mechanic to the extend that the entire battle system practically revolves around it, and I found it kind of boring and frustratingly unpredictable.  2) Strange difficulty settings  The game is either way too easy or way too hard. I've read interviews with the devs saying they want the game to be hard—ok, then why did you provide difficulty settings at all? It seems like hedging on their design. if they want this to be a difficult game, that would be fine and I'd know it's probably not for me. Difficulty settings imply I should be able to tailor the experience, and that option really isn't there. It's either brutally difficult or so easy that every enemy dies in a single hit.  I want some challenge, but I have a limited amount of time to play games and I don't want to spend 2 hours reattempting the same battle. On the other hand, the easiest difficulty setting makes the game so easy it's not really even enjoyable (it's so easy I'd rather just read a book).  Overall, I was either frustrated or bored. The battles were never satisfying—only too frutsrating or so easy they were boring."
Shamberger,180,11,4,April 11,Not Recommended,44.9,"95% of the reviews have lied to you, they are mindless comments that fail to understand what this game should have been. As subjective as that sounds, I would like to explain how Larian studios managed to take an almost perfect game and completely destroy it through sheer laziness.   First let’s talk about the AP costs. In the first game you had starting 4 ap, and the ability to increase this through perception, speed, constitution, lone wolf, and glass cannon. Now I start with 4 AP without a single way to increase this without lone wolf, and we all know glass cannon isn’t viable due to how the AI and armor systems work. So now you are stuck doing approximately 2 attacks a turn and there are 0 exceptions unless you haste. Not only that but the max AP is also just as restrictive being stuck at 6. The attempt to balance this atrocity with source points is almost just as ridiculous. You only get source points once per combat (exception being apotheosis)  and it’s a grind if you want to keep using them after the first battle.   Second, the talents, attributes, and abilities are a complete unfinished mess. Every point in abilities/attributes will equate to roughly 5% increased damage. That’s it. In the first game increasing intellect lowered your cool-downs, increased your chance to apply CC, and gave you damage. The abilities lack any form of creativity or play testing as far as I can see (45 hours). Putting points into single handed, leadership, duel wielding, retribution, perseverance, and ranged are pointless. Increasing my ranged / two handed doesn’t increase the damage my abilities do so what’s the point? Warfare increases all of my physical damage, so just dump all my points into that. The tool tips don’t even give you proper information either. The tank / utility ability points that I mentioned above are above useless, especially compared to the first game. We had body building, willpower, block chance, and putting points into a weapon type actually mattered. If I put points into CC resistance, I received CC resistance. if I put points into damage I got damage. If I put points into block, I could use shields more effectively, they were not just a flat armor that you NEED in order to not get blown up. I do however support the civil / combat difference, as it’s not horribly done like some other things aforementioned. The talents lack essentially any use at all. Melee is forced to take “The Pawn” which gives you an AP of movement for free, you are forced to take elemental affinity if you are mage (or be unable to do more than 1 good spell a turn), if you want to experience the game you are forced to take pet pal (BTW is extremely popular mod to remove this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ feature). 80% of the talents are virtually worthless, and you would never build them forcing you to take things that increase your abilities / attributes. The only good talent  was executioner, and they removed it’s compatibility with the pawn, and it only procs once per turn… Why??  The armor system is the dumbest thing ever implemented. There is no exception here. It doesn’t do anything but give you a health bar towards a specific damage type, and make CC abilities virtually useless because why CC them (after their armor / magic armor is gone) when you can just kill them. There is no reason to *not* have a shield if you are playing a mage or someone who doesn't rely on primary weapons. They give you about 50% of your total armor and an ability to replenish almost all of it. The AI cheat. There is no other way to put this. They have more AP, have better stats, and have perfect armor for their level every time. No exceptions. Don’t believe me just examine them. Top that off with how horrible the level scaling is in this game. You start the game doing 10-30 damage, and finish doing 2000-4000 damage a hit. Yes you read that correctly. The linear progression in the game increases your armor by around 25-40% every level, and 20-25% for your weapons. This is off of the previous value of course. This puts a massive emphasis on the level of your gear, because as mentioned earlier the AI already has perfect gear for their roles. Bringing up roles, they don’t exist anymore. Mages don’t CC with massive damage, Rogues don’t stealth assassinate people, tanks don’t aggro and take damage, rangers don’t do consistent damage, and supports are barely supporting with how long cool downs are and how little support spells there is. The only role in the game is Do damage. This is backed by how horrible the talents, abilities, and attributes are. Which by the way you don’t have to cater to, or plan ahead of time because they gave you a free re-spec at any point in the game. Something that is supposed to have a price or be cheated into the game is free… There are no consequences to me ♥♥♥♥ing up. But hey, amazing game right? Right 95% other people who mindlessly followed the majority like sheep. Or maybe you guys are just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Either way, ♥♥♥♥ you Larian Studios.

It has serveral races and abilites etc. It has some depth of story and even characters that are good enough. On the other hand it is a game that heavily requires on the scroll of internet to get to the next part. The game designers have mistaken hard puzzles for just general player confusion. They put in completly random things that no normal player would ever guess so often you are left wondering what do I do next?? This is especially evident in the latter part of the game.   My other complaint would be that while you are allowed to make any character you want, unless you take the stats that make your chracter super uber powered you will never get anywhere in the game without cheating. Maybe this is just a weakness on my part for not having played Divinty 1? But still it goes against the entire RPG system they have created and allow you to use.

The 4th Survivor,106,91,7,August 7,Not Recommended,70.4,"I really wanted to like DOS2 considering it boasts a DM mode, custom community content, nice graphics, interesting plot, and DnD-like gameplay, however one thing completely ruined it for me after having already played DOS1EE, that one thing is the way combat is handled with the ""armor"" system.  Everything was shaping up to be objectively better compared to the experience I had with Divinity: Original Sin 1 Enhanced Edition before I even played Divinity: Original Sin 2. After playing it though the ""Armor"" system quickly ruined the gameplay and pigeon-holed me(and my buddy) into only a few styles of play. The  ""Armor"" system is basically a health bar for your physical and magical armor that prevents Crowd Control effects till its broken and has to be replenished the same way health is, sounds pretty interesting and good on paper right?? However, in practice this means that crowd control is impossible to use until enough physical or magical damage is given to the enemy you want to use an ability on in question which becomes a problem for people who wanted to build a tanky character or multiclassed character who will be unable to do enough damage to ever be useful when compared to DOS1EE.  The best example I can give to compare the versatility of building a character in the first game is when I played with my friend he went full on support(basically reverse engineered a bard class) mixing a bunch of different magical schools and he was always able to contribute to our mutual success even without using damaging spells(which he could still use but he decided to specialize more in healing/haste/dmg buffs&accuracy buffs etc) contrast that with my character who was built towards maximizing health and resistances whilst also using 2 handers, basically a tank who didn't use shields. We were both successful and had a lot of fun with it even though neither of us were focusing on damage. When we played DOS2 we very quickly realized that mixing and matching even 2 different focuses was hampering our ability to deal with any given situation as we couldn't do enough damage to use 90% of our abilities effectively thanks to the armor system.  My final gripe is that lone wolf was broken compared to DOS1EE. In DOS1EE if your friend decided to choose lone wolf, they could still have a single companion with then, and you were the one who couldn't use a companion. Makes sense and doesn't ♥♥♥♥ over your buddy because of your decisions right? Well in DOS2 if one of you takes it then you both might as well because if even one extra companion is in your party you lose the effects of lone wolf for whatever reason. Additionally just because you picked up lone wolf in DOS1EE didn't mean you were stronger than a party of 4, it was more an option for people that didn't want to manage more characters and preferred a different style of play. Not the case in DOS2 as we quickly found out that the most viable option in the entire game is 2 lone wolves going for a pure damage build, every other option is so much worse that you cannot really expect to have fun trying out anything that isn't pure damage and it is all thanks to how the ""Armor"" system was implemented combined with the changes to lone wolf making it overpowered instead of just different.  I never really expected to be so put off by the sequel when I had so much fun with the first game. In DOS1EE both of our characters were unique and well thought out and in the DOS2 our characters became thinly armored artillery cannons and battering rams out of necessity rather than ingenuity and that is why I am disappointed in DOS2. I really wanted to not only like it but love it but me and my buddy got bored and couldn't even finish our campaign compared to when we played DOS1EE we couldn't put the game down day after day until it was over.  Maybe Definitive Edition will solve these issues but I remain doubtful based on how the armor system was implemented, it's very existence will be practically sewn into the game at this point and even a second comb over from the devs will likely keep it very much the same."

You can carefully position units and use spells to create surfaces only to have enemies randomly drop cursed surfaces that overwrite everything else are very difficult to remove.  Overall, it's difficult to prepare for a battle or try various tactics when the surfaces are so random and difficult to control. The game designers seem to love the surfaces mechanic to the extend that the entire battle system practically revolves around it, and I found it kind of boring and frustratingly unpredictable.  2) Strange difficulty settings  The game is either way too easy or way too hard. I've read interviews with the devs saying they want the game to be hard—ok, then why did you provide difficulty settings at all? It seems like hedging on their design. if they want this to be a difficult game, that would be fine and I'd know it's probably not for me. Difficulty settings imply I should be able to tailor the experience, and that option really isn't there. It's either brutally difficult or so easy that every enemy dies in a single hit.  I want some challenge, but I have a limited amount of time to play games and I don't want to spend 2 hours reattempting the same battle. On the other hand, the easiest difficulty setting makes the game so easy it's not really even enjoyable (it's so easy I'd rather just read a book).  Overall, I was either frustrated or bored. The battles were never satisfying—only too frutsrating or so easy they were boring."

Re-rolled and this time made it to the second act. I learned how to ""bless"" surfaces, and was anxious to try it out in combat. That proved to be completely pointless, everything became a sea of necrofire anyway.  Equally pointless to bother doing anything but physical damage + max warfare as well, given the dual armor system. And there are loads of other niggles that I can't be bothered with, just like I can't be bothered to finish this thing. My wife stuck it out on her own campaign and had nothing but increasingly horrible things to say about everything after the second act.  Obviously plenty of people like it, and you might too. Certainly there's a ghost of a good game trapped in this chinese finger trap arcade machine. I found it more pointlessly frustrating than rewarding, and not worth the time investment."

Dobermann,595,No,0,April 28,Not Recommended,126.4,"Big fan of the first Original Sin. Had a lot of fun playing it through with two pads and split screen with a friend. This review is meant for fans of the first one and are looking more of the same. For those without Original Sin experience I can say I wouldn't recommend this game as a first Original Sin game.  So what has changed? Archery has been improved and is usefull in the beginning already. You have access to many skills that allow you to move full spell range from your enemies without any opportunity attacks to block you. Saddly, so has most of the enemy also. So you and your advesaries jump around a lot more than in the first one.  You have two different types of armor, physical and magical. Physical armor is meant to be removed before you are able to get health damage and extra effects like knockdown throuh. Same with magical armor and spell effects, just using different bar. This means you should use different damage on different enemies. It isn't challenging as much it is limiting.  A lot more different skills. Most of you won't be using at all. Not because they have far more useful counterparts, but also because you are introduced a memory slot system that only lets you learn a limited number of skills/spells. These can be changed out of battle, so with save/load scoutiing you can set them optimal before fight. So, not challenging, just limiting.  With creative usage of foliage and height differences your surroundings are much more lively than in the first one. Sadly I also found them more difficult to understand. Height differences should create tactical opportunities but they are lost because everyone jump around. Don't worry, the indicator is still the same white spot that you can't find in fiery surroundings.  You can't choose your fights as ambushes are used a lot. With save/load scouting and using indestructible foot high carpet rolls as barricades you might be able to capture a hint of the first ones strategical dimensions, but do note that enemy will jump around. Cities are not a safe zone. Game tries to irritate you into fight there propably even more than in the nature. Load will be used often. After you leave from first island, game will penalize you about loading with long load times. Don't dare to think what they would be without SSD.  You won't be using crafting much at anything. It has been downgraded close to zero from the first one forcing you to rely on drops and vendors with your gear.  Clear bugs that should not be in a finished product. ""Press B to end your turn"" indication is left to other players screen after battle. Game stops registering xbox controller that has been left unattended for a while. The quests also have a lot more unrefined feel to them compared to the first game.  The first Original Sin was difficult for us from time to time, but all in all it was rewarding. Can't say the same at all about the second one. A lot of clocked game time has been used looking at the same loading screen. Not just because of some difficult fights, but trying to realize if you were meant to fight with them at that point or at all as even your potential companions try pick a fight with you.  So, like I said earlier, I can't recommend this game to be the first Original Sin game. But I can't recommend it to be the second one either."
latte,238,5,0,March 18,Not Recommended,156.8,"If you came here expecting to create your own character and have fun adventures with your partner like in the first one, this isn't the game for you. Custom characters are deprived of important story chunks and in game decisions in favor of the premade ones and party interaction is gone (it's basically tacked on multiplayer now, the game doesn't even acknowledge more than 1 player).  Might be a good single player game, but I was hoping for more of the same, which was disappointing.  Update after spending 70 hours in single player:  At some point around the 50 hour mark, the game started to give me errors while saving, though it would still save the game anyway. After that, my profile bugged out. Every time I booted the game, my profile name changed to Debug_Player_Profile_1 and the original profile was gone. The folder was still there, though. Copying saves to a new profile didn't work, and neither did the other solutions suggested in the Larian forums and Steam forums. The only solution I found was to back up my saves, wipe out the profile folder and make a new profile with the same name as the original, which the game suddenly recognized in the cloud and gave me my saves back. I managed to play for a few hours after that, but this morning there were no saves in the cloud anymore and the debug profile was back.   TLDR Broken game, stay away"

JayRob,503,20,1,"September 22, 2017",Not Recommended,41.2,"Beware hyperbole.  ""Best game ever"" this is not.   Story is pretty interesting, and the first act of the game is fun.    The combat overall is pretty poorly balanced.  The armor mechanic, while seeming interesting at first, really hurts the balance later in the game.  Crowd control is basically neutralized, as you can't apply any status effect while a character's armor is still up.  There are certain battles which require you to protect certain NPCs under a time limit.  The enemy will all tunnel vision on the one NPC you're supposed to protect, in some cases this is 6+ enemy combatants.  You can't possibly outdamage that many enemies so normally your strategy would be to use crowd control to delay them until the time limit is up.  However, due to the armor system, this requires you to essentially outdamage 6+ enemies AND apply crowd control to them BEFORE they can kill your VIP.  This is simply impossible, especially with a 2-man Lone Wolf group.  The issue here seems to be a lack of playtesting all the various options that are available to the player.  Many power combinations are too powerful and others are not competitive.  Look no further than the infinite damage loop bug that the developers almost kept in the game because it was ""creative"".  The higher difficulties just exacerbate these issues even more.  The combat overall just lacks nuance, it doesn't feel tactical, mainly due to a lack of defensive options i.e. ways to negate or deter enemy actions.  This is putting aside all the combat bugs which are incredibly frustrating, such as Attacks of Opportunity not triggering and your character's turn being skipped for no reason.  This is all very sad after hearing laughable claims like ""More strategic than XCOM.""  I've put about 40 hours (half of that being pre-release) in the game on the higher difficulties before I couldn't stand the poor combat any longer.  I may start over on explorer simply to experience the story, which was quite good in my playtime.  I will give big kudos to the developer for adding full voice-overs, as it enhances the immersion and engagement of the story ten-fold.  Maybe I've gotten my money's worth already, but I am overall feeling disappointed, and I expected a lot more.  Wait for the inevitable Enhanced Edition I guess?  P.S.  For goodness sake, make your story achievements hidden."
edmek55555,450,27,1,"September 22, 2017",Not Recommended,100.7,"I want to start this review by saying this is one of the best games I have ever played (much like the first original sin). I absolutely love this game and plan to play it again with different characters.   So why am I giving it a down? Well the first three quarters of the game are phenomenal. Act 2 specifically has some of the best side quests, world building, and characters of any game I have ever played. However the last act craps all over that. It switches from turn based rpg to more of a full on puzzle game, it is absolutely littered with generic npcs unlike the other areas, and all the fights go from tactical well thought out battles to games of ""find the gimmick that will help you cheese this fight""  On top of that they built up a phenomenal story with fantastic characters only for the ending to be incredibly bland and generic.

Regarding the quests, you'll pull your hair out looking for the answers to far too many of them; google is required. While with the combat, you might as well have a good book to read while everything is moving around, and it really ends up being more frustraiting than fun; far too easy to be entirely disabled and slow as f***.

buemmschaf,575,9,0,October 16,Not Recommended,82.9,"Good, not great. Full of awesome stuff, but also full of 'howevers'.  Tactical combat full of choices and decisions, with a boatload of skills to combine with each other to get you through. However - battles sometimes start completely without warning, some of them are just unwinnable by design, others seem to expect you to save-scum to get your people into a winnable starting position.  Excellent story full of twists and turns, with excellent character design and writing. However - quests are poorly defined, goals and conditions to complete them sometimes comparable to the worst among point-and-click adventures. Remember the times when you had to scan the screen, clicking each pixel to find the one that's interactable? Now imagine having a huge, open map where you need to find the specific doodad that advances the quest - except you have no idea where it's supposed to be or what it even looks like.  Puzzles - some of them make sense, others are of the 'you got to be kidding me' variant. I stumbled over some solutions just by accident, others i finally caved and checked a wiki for.  I guess that's my main problem - the longer the game goes on, the more i feel myself drawn to consult a wiki to deal with frustration.  Having to consult an external source to enjoy a game is something i see as a failure on the design side - solutions to your game should be findable inside the game, not by consulting a third-party resource.  The game is full of awesome moments and great stories, and it genuinely entices me to explore it more. At the same time it frustrates me to no end with its design choices. It feels like one of the games I loved as a kid - full of character, deeply immersive, but also deeply flawed in a way sure to frustrate. I don't really have the patience for these kinds of flawns any more. I like Divinity II and will definitely finish it. But I can't in good conscience recommend it."
Pool,205,16,1,"December 27, 2017",Not Recommended,22.8,"Divinity Original Sin 2.  TL;DR: 6/10. Get it on sale.  The bad:  Writing: The writing for this game is muteable at best. It and NWN 1 share the 'main campaign is♥♥♥♥♥ syndrome. I do not like any of the NPCs, any of the quests or any of the plots. It lacks feeling, everything is so gray and cliche.  Barrel mechanics: The game is oversaturated in environmental hazards, most notably barrels. I feel these are to the game's detriment and I am loathed to see them no matter where they are.  Game mechanics: They're not very satisfying. It's over-saturated in magic, conditions and punishes you for being tried-and-true melee as opposed to being any sort of spellcaster or ranged combatant. Even the monsters are throwing magic. Quit that. There's also physical and magical armor, that halves damage and... huh? It's more convoluted than any of the DND rulesets prior to 5E, as someone who's played them religiously for a decade.  Lack of direction: The game sort of just... plops you in and expects you to find your way. The NPCs you do talk to basically mumble about nothing worthwhile before dropping bread crumbs of a quest in their mumble and expecting you to unravel it. Your friend? Where? Who? What? Where do I find them? Who are they? What were they doing that got them captured? Elaborate. Give me something to go on. But lets say for the sake of it that you decide to play along and actually adventure around trying to find what they're talking about. I personally could not care any less about the actual adventuring aspect, because the terrain is the same old ugly terrain that puts me to sleep to just look at it. It suffers from 'everything is samey and bland' syndrome, like Path of Exile.  Camera angles: Ungodly awful. To swivel and look around with it is a headache. Two different buttons just to pan your camera? Neverwinter Nights one called, they said they want to loan you the driving camera.  Bugs: There's so many bugs. NPCs will randomly turn hostile (even if you did nothing to upset them, no thievery, no nothing). Sometimes in the arena beneath Fort Joy, you'll beat all of the combatants. If you're playing with friends, you'll have to fight each other for dominance. Even if you win (or lose), sometimes you'll just be stuck roaming around the map because it won't pull you out, and you'll have to reload. The bugs steadily become worse and worse by act 4.  Poorly planned Multiplayer: The ability to play with three other people is a nice gesture, BUT, to play with them, you'll have to start with them at the very beginning. You can't introduce a character mid-game and have them scale up or down to the main character's level. Otherwise, you'll have to play some limp gimp premade NPC who the main player probably uses as nothing more than a loot mule and a bullet sponge.  ---- The 'meh'  UI: It's serviceable. It's not great, often times the chat box will get stuck where you're trying to click. Sometimes, when you're trying to control an NPC, it won't completely register what you wanted to do, and instead your character who's at the top of this post will instead abandon his post to chase a barrel.  The soundtrack: Generic Latin-lite choirs. It is so bland it is incapable of being offensive to the ear. It is unspired and to be truthful, I did not care for it.  Art Design: The game is bland and grey on the art design as well. Nothing jumps out and impresses. The cutscenes in which drawn characters do battle or things of that sort look far better, but the game itself is just... meh. It's clear that the armor was intended to be little more than just shapes to tell who was who when zoomed out at full capacity. ---- The good:   Initiative track: The game has a functioning initiative list, where you can join battles mid engagement, as well as ensure everyone has a fair turn. NWN had one of these but didn't truly work.  Moddable: Like Neverwinter Nights, you can mod the game to high hell and back, changing a lot of the problem I had with the game.  Custom modules: You can completely ignore the primary campaign and play different modules. There is also a DM feature, in which the DM can control NPCs, create pieces on the dot, make them talk and onwards. Much, again (if you haven't seen a running theme in comparison) like Neverwinter Nights and to the game's favor.  -----  Final verdict: The game is serviceable as an RPG, but not very fun to play. I believe the future of this game does not rest in the production of the company, but rather in the hands of the community."

I did start on tactician and wasted a good 30 hours banging my head agains the wall, before I had to start over and lower the difficulty.

maats,113,6,2,"October 3, 2017",Not Recommended,181.4,"First let me say I played Divinity Original Sin through twice. I loved that game. So naturally I was looking forward to DOS2. Admittedly both games have alot in common but not everything. The big exception seems to be play balance. The play balance in the classic mode of DOS was nearly perfect and I played the entire gamne through in that mode. Classic mode wasn't so easy it would be boring and just difficult enough so you had to be careful about your strategy or suffer death. Not so with DOS2.   I started playing in classic mode at Fort Joy and found it challanging but not impossible. However after heading to Reapers Cove it became impossible to beat any mob unless there was some trick to it that permitted me to beat them without fighting. Each mob was at least two levels above me and they always got to attack first. Worse each member of the mob would have three or four moves even before I was able to attack. So with an mob of 4 guys they would make up to 12- 16 moves BEFORE I could even attack. Bythat time each of my guys would be low on armor, frozen, diseased, poisoned outflanked etc. That automatically put me in a defensive mode to heal armor and/or health points which meant I wasn't hitting back. When I was able to hit back my attacks did far less damage to them than they did to me. This doesn't include them using spells on me that weren't available for purchase or too expensive to buy.  So I figured I try playing in story mode which is so easy I could probably take on a voidwoken with a toothbrush and win.   I don't know what the developers did to screw up the game balance but it's not longer fun to play in either story or classic mode. I don't want to give it a thumbs down becasue I'm  going to play in story mode to gain a few levels to even things out and then go back to classic mode to see if there's a difference. But I can't give it a thumbs up either because things might end up just as unbalanced when I switch back to classic mode. Since I have to choose one or the other I have to give it a thumbs down based on my experience so far. Hopefully all will be well if I level a couple of times but I'm not keeping my fingers crossed.  Ok, heres a second take on DOS II. The game is buggy, and not in a minor way. For example the pipe puzzle quest doesn't work. Nothing flows into the pipe channels when I press the control tiles. I was able to get around it somewhat by standing at the right or left corner of the control panel and placing a transport pyramid on the other side of the barrier (I'm sure that's a bug too). Then I transported down to where the three valves are and manually turned them. That got the holy elements flowing into the channels.  Unfortunately they don't flow in the correct direction when I move the control tiles. I hate this. This is a game stopper inasmuch to the best of my knowledge I need to finish this in order to continue the main quest.  IMO there's no excuse for this. When the smaller quests are bugged it's irritating but I can get around them. But now I can't advance in a game I shelled out $40 for.  What a joke."
Phantus,289,27,12,September 3,Not Recommended,265.1,"This game's a bit of a mess.  The armour system is poorly thought out as is the leveling and scaling system.  The environmental hazard is out of control and Act 4 seemed like it was done by Larians B team.  Everything is on fire.  Everything is poisoned.  Everything is frozen.  Everything is steamy.  Having the environment react to elemental spells and abilities is a cool idea but if they cut the sheer amount of this by half it would still be too much.  Battlefields ultimately become a ridiculous game of elemental hopscotch.  It's hard to tell what's going on half the time through the smoke and steam.  It's comical after awhile.  The armour, weapons and level scaling is a self-inflicted wound for Larian.  The hours I spent going over merchant wares to find better weapons because mine had become obsolete after a few levels must have accounted for a quarter of my play time.  These topics have been done to death so I'll leave them alone suffice to say you don't have to reinvent every wheel you come across.  It doesn't make sense, it didn't work and sadly bogs down a good story, interesting characters and nice graphics.  It's a popular game and many happily overlook its faults so I'm happy for them.

I have had trouble with: perma burning from cursed unique/legendary already removed, perma decay, perma wet and having characters be able to keep fighting when their hp is below 0.

Rear Fanged Venomous,29,20,2,January 13,Not Recommended,81.8,"While the game is very entertaining for some time, parts of the integral mechanics become unbearable over time. The AI of the enemy is insufferable, as they will merely walk around and drag fights out for seemingly no reason. While on this topic, the fights, while extremely interactive and unique, granted, take a very long time to complete. The ability to skip or speed up turns would go a long way to making the gameplay flow better. When completing questions, waypoints will appear and never leave; even when you beat the quest they will remain.  On the story side, I am torn. The lore in the game is incredibly in-depth with a plethora of supernatural powerhouses and somewhat unique powers, but the story itself is brutally bad. Do NOT read further unless you are OK with spoilers. While the first half of the story is very engaging and interesting, it completely falls apart half way through. Everyone who was bad turns good (except one), everyone who is good turns bad, the decisions you make don't matter. Anyone who you choose to kill will come back (if only to die again literally two minutes later) and there is nothing you can do to prevent this, despite the game tricking you into thinking your choices matter. The primary antagonist uses a weapon that is never mentioned once to beat you in one of the hardest ""this only happened because plot"" moments I have seen in fiction. For the final decision, the choice does impact the world, but at that point you don't get to see the effects outside of a minute long epilogue.   On the whole, the gameplay is generally good but has very irritating issues, such as bad NPC AI and permanent waypoints. The story, despite having an incredible potential and great worldbuilding, falls flat on its face harder than I have ever seen a story do.

Eyndra,71,24,2,February 5,Not Recommended,88.9,"I have some really mixed emotions about this game.   I'll start with the good.   This game's platform is very good. In a party oriented strategic RPG I have never played a game with better mechanics.   This game's platform for modding is left very open ended and mod-friendly, and user created content can really enrich the experience.   There is a lot of nuance in character builds, and you can make your character a useful addition to a team, or play solo in many fulfilling ways.  The bad?   Unless you're playing with the max of 4 people in co-op, this game will keep you busy for no more than 40 hours.   The story isn't open-ended, there is no new game+, and you can't revisit the world after the game is over.   The story is hilariously convoluted and you'd have to have a flair for tin-foil-hat levels of curiosity and tedium to be able to enjoy that aspect.   There is no gratifying ending available to you in this game.   Most interesting character development is walled behind ""speech checks,"" where you're given the option to choose several dialogue options that will impact the character's development; which isn't a problem in particular, but the developers were a little overzealous, with some character arcs requiring the correct permutation of up to 40 of these ""multiple choice"" options, with some details being so minute no blame could be assigned for failing them.   The developers added a ridiculous amount of detail to this game without actually adding any ""meat and potatoes"" content that is rewarding for the player.   You are expected to explore every nook and cranny on every map to be able to appreciate the story, with the continuation of some story arcs locked behind some buried pouch in some obscure and completely insignificant location.   Without the aid of mods, the game is seriously absent of balance; mods are the lifeblood of this game's accessibility.  In summary, as a single person looking to buy this game to without the intention of co-op, it is seriously not worth full price. There are more options to explore in the multiplayer arena that may make the game more fun for small groups, but regarding what the developers have provided us with, the game is sorely lacking and you'll end up paying for more than you get."
CrazyOatmeal,176,7,0,"November 14, 2017",Not Recommended,274.4,"Do you want to be punished for existing? Do you like being constrained by rules that do not apply to your enemies? Do you like being afraid to talk to NPCs in case they instakill your entire party at a whim? Then boy, is Divinity 2 the game for you.   In this game, if you're not running one of three cookie-cutter builds, and/or you're not playing on the easiest difficulty, you can forget about enjoyable gameplay. Everything costs extortionate amounts of money, in a world that is 100% finite, and traders will buy items from you at one tenth their actual value. Being one level below your enemies means instant defeat, and being one level above means a complete steamrolling - even if you do somehow manage to overlevel, because there are so few quests  - all of which involve combat, most of which completely unfair - that if you miss one or two at the beginning of the game, you are crippled for the rest of your campaign.   Bosses will simply ignore the mechanics of combat, using as many action points per turn and summoning as many allies as they feel like, and using spells that are leagues beyond what are available to a player at that level. This game's understanding of ""balance"" extends as far as having your rogue - assuming you decided to make one (if not, ♥♥♥♥ you, game over) - pickpocket every living soul from Fort Joy to Arx in order to buy enough equipment to keep you in the same league as enemies of your level, because if your armor is one level below yours, you might as well be wearing soggy tissue paper. Naturally, this punishes you for having a party of more than two people. There are NPCs in this game that, when spoken to, will give you a variety of persuasion options - all of which are guaranteed to fail, even with maxed persuasion stats (I have tested this thorughly) - and when they do fail, the NPC will turn hostile and one-shot your entire party before you are even able to take an action.   The cold, divisive meta of the game is that self-healing is a waste of time, armor restoration is a waste of time, and interesting builds are a waste of time. Spec everything into physical damage or run a 4-summoner party and faceroll the game if you don't want to lose. If you want to be creative with your party build, you're quite welcome to, so long as you don't plan on getting into any combat - which the game physically requires you to do in order to gain experience.   Divinity Original Sin 2 is a beautiful, intricate game - infected with the most moronic encounter design and balancing I have ever seen in a video game, period."
mattboesen,243,5,1,April 9,Not Recommended,146.9,"A great game.  Visually stunning, RPG fabulous, plot and thinking excellent.  Except, the devs still haven't learned some basic 'niceties' of gameplay.  Take a look at...any other game of this turn-based AP genre, and you won't find a single one of these problems.  Graphics 9/10 Story and Lore 10/10 Character Complexity 9/10 Gameplay 1/10 Combat Rules 1/10  1. Don't let me shoot into the floor.  Stop me.  Don't make me waste the AP.  This is simple stuff guys.  Yes, I can see that it says my LOS is blocked, but then why allow me to click?  You've trapped the error, now do something with it for darn sake. 2. Why does line of sight NOT work for bad guys?  They have no line of sight rules at all.  Shoot through a floor, a rock, a ceiling, a wall, no problems.  Reciprocal line of sight is ignored, and enemies have no penalty for low height apparently.  The algorithm clearly has a trap in it that says ""ignore the LOS step if it is AI targetting player'.  This is a design choice you have consciously made.  This is an admission of guilt by the devs that they couldnt get it right in gameplay instead. 3. Don't make my toons walk through stuff on the floor if they can get around it easily.  Make it easy for me to avoid.  The most common path in this game appears to start with ""Make a u-turn at Alberquerque and folloow the Basingstoke Roundabout"". This, too, is simple stuff guys.  Oh, but the enemies avoid it, so there is sensible pathing programmed into the game.  So why the hell can't I use the same pathfinding algorithm?  Oh yeah, reasons. 4. In trade, let me sell stuff off differnt guys.  Don't make me move it all into one inventory first.  Simple improvement in quality of life for me.  You will spend an extraordinary quantity of time just screwing around with bags in this game for ... reasons. 5. Yes, I am covered in oil and slowed.  No, it is totally unecessary to make my toon walk like a cripple.  I get it.  He's slow.  Now hurry the hell up and let me play.  Sigh... 6. I hide my Rogue.  The combat starts.  My rogue goes last.  So much for 'sneak' attack.  Its alsmost like smart tactics lead to dumb results according to the rules they apply.  If you are keen to have innovative tactics, maybe make them rewarding. 7. Height line of sight is totally nuts.  There are places that can see everything, and be attacked from nowhere, but only if you are an AI.  For no reason at all.  In the Fort Joy arena, yes, the enemy platform is totally invulnerable, since I cannot see the floor even if it were in range.  That's just garbage.  Oh, and when I am there, I can see...well...pretty much nowhere. 8. Hiding behind a wall, on the other side of the battlefield - no problems!  Enemy will suddenly have one hundred AP to walk on over and kill you.  Don't worry, not a bug at all.  Nice, fair, even combat, with sensible rules.  I've seen toons walk thirty metres and then use two abilities, even though they used all their AP the turn before. 8. Basic bugs - ""Blinded was removed by Clear Minded"" followed immediately by being unable to shoot because I am Blinded.  Hahahahahahahahahaha. Ox dung. 9. Enemy uses four two-AP abilities in a turn, and moves as well.  Yeah...umm...say what?  There are simply so many things in the turn-based part of this game which are pointlessly tedious, and so many things that should have been found in playtest, that I wonder if about half of the gameplay is you fighting the interface and stupidity of the toons, or the devs themselves.  Yes, this is a game where you fight everyone but the enemy at times.  The rest of the game, still absolutely awesome.  The lore and concepts are great, the maps are fantastic, the humour even has some bite.  But the gameplay niceties are totally missing.  Just like last time around.  This is the same kludge of rubbish, clothed in a pretty suit."
mario.konrad,119,3,1,June 16,Not Recommended,82.3,"Pro: - A fantastic game (Fott Joy, Driftwood). Non-linear approach to solve interesting quests. - Choices matter. - Interesting stories of companions.  Meh: - Mediocre later in the game (Nameless Isle, Arx) to a point where it gets tedious. Boring quests with ""traditional"" puzzles. This is really a bummer. Nameless Isle was basically running simulator on rails, this is a complete disappointment after Driftwood. Choices matter less and less. - Some game breaking bugs (for example I could not resolve the Imp shrine on the Nameless Isle, despite having fixed the Core and having the ruby in my inventory, the game would not let me finish the quest, achievement lost, bummer). - The combat system is part of the story (source points), but IMO is broken by the fixed max amount of AP. I liked the system of DOS1 better. Investing points into CON mattered.  Cons: - As the game progresses, the fights are always rigged in favor of the enemy. Sometimes I get the feeling, the game expects me to reload after a failure, ""to do better"". - As convenient as it seems, the respec (for free) feature on the Vengence, degrades the quality of the game. Just respec the character for a specific event, then respec back, this breaks immersion, because choices do not matter, the characters becomes a generic puppet. - The final battle is plain simple ♥♥♥♥ing cheating. Enemies having overpowered abilities with no cooldowns, far beyond what the game mechanics for the player allows, super high HP, respawning Kraken, etc. It's not a challenge, it's simply cheating. It really feels like Larian has rushed the game at the end, and ruined it. WTF.   I really liked the story, build up early, the twists, etc. But after Driftwood, I frwoned every time I had to fight. Cheap cheating is simply not fun. It would have been better for Larian to create a shorter game without the cheating. I'm not a person to give up at the first hurdle (have beaten the doctor in deamon form on my fourth attempt), but it's just not fun anymore.  Would have loved to go back for seconds, but I'm really hestitating to a point to simply not caring anymore. This cheating has ruined the game for me. Shame.  Would I recommend the game? For fanbois, sure. For people like me, who appreciate a good story, looking for a fair (not necessarily easy) game, I tend to say no."

I played on an Xbox one gamepad, and ran into an issue where when I was in a menu, a d-pad input would get stuck, making it imossible to save or reload my gamefile.

For starters all the enemies have a ton more action points than you.  to the point of making it ridiculous.  they will attack you three times, down a potion, and fly to certain areas making them un reachable.  There are traps for you everywhere.  you never once get the jump on your enemies, leaving you to wonder, how stupid are the gods if the chosen one doesnt see anything coming.  you are always stuck in some canyon and being attacked by everyone on higher ground.  its tiring and not fun.  i shouldnt have to run through combat 3 or 4 times to try and progress in the story.  you can combine affects like ""wet"" with ice attacks to freeze your foes.  but it doesnt work on your foes.  it only works on you.  you cant see through steam clouds or people in them, but your enemies can.

Reality is a cruel mistress. The battle system's complexity is a mindless popping of ""tactical decisions"", where everything pretty much explodes all the time. Holy water, cursed fire, blessed fish-tanks... who cares. It's just not fun. The best tactic is to focus completely on one type of attacks (armor or magical armor breaking) and pretty much make your whole party focus on one parameter. And this is not fun either. Regarding the story - it's broken. Sometimes you don't even know what's going on, except when the journal decides to pop some information that your characters have - mysteriously so - garnered, although I've no idea how they have. People seem to think that ""choices matter"" here. They don't. Trust me, I've tried.  Best RPG out there? Maybe. But if it ain't fun then I'd rather stick to sub-par ones. Nice try though."
Olnia,129,7,3,March 13,Not Recommended,71.5,"An honest review about Divinity: Original Sin 2.  Divinity 2 leaves me with bittersweet feelings about the future of storytelling in general for video games.   This game started off so amazingly well; the plot, gameplay and character detail in everything you did was what drew me into playing a top-down adventure RPG for hours a day.   In a time of completely over-the-top FPS games and reckless abandon-style ""story-driven"" RPGs about covert operation soldiers, as concieved by one completely insane Japanese man (ala Metal Gear Solid: 1-anything), this game is a breath of fresh air and the reason why I felt compelled to write a formal review for the first time ever.  The gameplay is top notch for a turn-based RPG; with tactics and interuption strategies taking precedent over gear investment and level-grinding.   This is truly the ""thinking man's RPG"", forcing players on higher difficulties to make careful decisions in almost every scenario.   Formulating balanced parties and covering individual weaknesses is key to success, as the game will take every chance to test your combat readiness.     The customization is very good; only lacking in some of the most abstract and long-term of considerations.   One such example is: min-maxing characters into specific roles essentially becomes non-existant after the second act of the game, as you find a way to alter and re-distribute character skill points into anything you like, at any time.   This really detracts from the overall committment I thought I was forced into making, as early on in the game I was carefully analyzing every level-up I recieved, so as to maximize my party's adaptability.     (SPOILERS FROM THIS POINT ONWARD)    That however, is only a formality when compared to the story and its ending: wow, I don't think I have ever seen such a great story completely destroyed by it's ending since the iconic Ultima series (ironic as I have compared this game series to our generation's Ultima).     The Plot starts off amazing; a quest to ascend and become gods, retaking a long-vacant, world-ruler throne as the new ascended Divine.    The notes of long-term D&D campaings called me into playing this game, as one of the atractions of playing D&D long-term is to eventually become a god of a particular focus and take up the responcibilities of said god.     This game has no intention of letting you rule anything.      I know I'm basically spoiling the ending for you, but this game was clearly rushed due to monetary restrictions.   The final act of the game, which should be the most diverse and spraling location of the entire world of Rivelon, is oddly boring and lacks any focused polish.   The endings of tag-line quests are scatter-shot in terms of satisfaction; some (mainly Lohse's quest) leave you feeling like something meaningful was acomplished and are now closer to your companion as a result, while others feel dull and rushed, making the entire story of traveling with this companion feel worthless.     The final ending: sucks.    It really sucks; leaving the players feel like they are in a rejected Highlander-style fan fiction, the ending boils down to convincing your companions to accept your divinity over theirs, overwise taking their heads in confrontation to prove that there can only be one.   While the final boss battle is epic and challenging, ultimately the choice boils down to several options that you don't care about and, quite frankly, do not represent the intentions of the players who invested almost a hundred hours into playing this game.   After everything I had learned from playing this game in its entirety; my ultimate decision to rule Rivelon was subverted by a speech desicion I had made two hours before the ending when I lied to someone to gain their favor, a decision which was made practically applicable over the course of the entire game and never punished me for making such a desicion.     While the game has its flaws (It has major flaws!!!) it is highly enjoyable to play alone or with friends in Multiplayer.   While I hate the ending that basically aborts all your work throughout the story, the game provides a combat/D&D replication system so addictive, that this is the first top-down RPG I have played in over a decade.   Ignoring the crappy ending to the story, this game is a great way to waste an entire week on the computer if you choose to get invested in its gameplay.  Thanks for reading"
Mojave,101,1,0,October 24,Not Recommended,146.4,"This game is fun with fantastic combat and a much better story than DOS1, but it's an absolute nightmare to play with other people (IE: the intended way). The dialog system SUCKS, one person can talk to an important NPC, breeze through all the text and close the window and if you don't catch it in time you're out of luck. It's also way, waaaaay to common that you'll find yourself stuck in a dialog window without a way to leave it except for progressing with the story, which is an enormous inconvenience if some random NPC starts talking to you on their own and you're sitting at the keys twiddling your thumbs waiting for another player to come back from being AFK.  Tons of stuff in this game is 100% dependant on who first initiates dialog with an NPC and if you don't talk to them with someone who has the right talents or character tags you could end up being completely locked out of quests or content. It's such a stupid system it hurts. I honestly believe and would stake my life on the fact that Larian's idea of replay value is randomly and unintuitively denying the player content.  And don't even get me started about the achievements, by act 2 I was totally disgusted by the number of achievements I failed to get unlocked simply because another person I was playing with was the one who talked to an NPC. Why the ♥♥♥♥ should only 1 of the 3 people playing recieve an achievement when all of us are standing there at the same time?   It really seems like this game was designed by jerks who wanted to stick it to people playing together as a group. I would never, ever recommend playing this in any way other than alone. If you value story and not being arbitrarily denied content because of hidden stat requirements that you would NEVER know about normally then I highly suggest using a guide for most of the puzzles and important dialog instances. But the story IS good so do try to avoid spoilers in that regard.  And if you're someone who cares about achievements you absolutely 100% need to play the game alone while using a guide for them, because it's super easy to totally fail many of them without even knowing what happened because of bad game design (I'm looking at you, two Gareth achievements). You can literally be locked out of both just for entering a certain map cell that you would normally just wander into.  If you want to play a DOS game with another person do yourself a favor and buy DOS1 instead. The story might suck in comparison but at least the glaring flaws in the dialog system aren't presant."
linkerError,832,3,1,June 18,Not Recommended,8.2,"tl;dr: you already know whether or not you want to buy this.  A few improvements to the original, but still makes all the same mistakes as the original did. If you liked the original, by all means, take the dive. But if you found the original frustrating, boring or hated the scavenger-hunt style of quest design, you will find nothing has changed. Expect lots of vague objectives and wandering around aimlessly for hours at a time whilst waiting to stumble on the solution to quests. Saving and reloading the game is the primary progression mechanic and the enemies in this game will routinely wipe you out instantly on anything but the easiest difficulty setting.   I recommend you avoid this game unless you're personally pretty sure you'll like it. It is meant for a certain type of gamer (ones pejoratively dubbed 'The Commentocracy' by game critic Jim Sterling) and I am not one of them. That said, it's likely everyday folks might eke out some extra enjoyment from the excellent co-op mode, which is the only feature that makes these games worth buying imho -- having a friend along dulls the impact of the terrible design issues the rest of the game has. Or maybe misery loves company.  Despite having everything going for it in practically every other way, the godawful quest design turns what would otherwise be an exceptional PC RPG into a miserable slog. Avoid unless you think you can cope with these issues."
Kyrth,509,3,4,May 3,Not Recommended,142.3,"Charming world, interesting characters, but the combat is too annoying to be fun.  The emphasis is all about system manipulation and setting yourself up to win ahead of time vs actual tactics. Basically, it's strategic, but not tactical. There are no choices to be made once combat starts. The choice in this game comes from setting up your character and party. And better hope you chose correctly, and maximized the right skill. If you're not completely optimized, it will become impossible to proceed. So, make sure to research the internet for builds, and how to cheese the game.  In addition, the armor system ruins combat. It works like this: physical armor stops all physical damage; magic armor does the same for magic damage. One type of damage will not affect the other. Both types of armor completely negate status effect skills. To use your special skills on an enemy first you have to whittle down one the armor types to 0. But if you are using both types of damage, like in a traditional balanced party, it will take too long, and you will die.  The armor system encourages a party of either pure physical damage or pure magic damage. A balanced party increases the difficulty to the point where every battle requires trial and error, and quicksave abuse. I'm 8 hours in, and I decided to restart the game focusing on one damage type for my party. If I was less than 2 hours in, I would just return it."

Herakilla,460,13,8,March 30,Not Recommended,61.1,"I loved the first game and played that multiple times as well as the enhanced edition.  This game starts out great.  The changes they made to almost all of the core mechanics are awesome.  But these changes have some serious side effects.  The AI is essentially too smart is what it all boils down to.  For example. there is no point in having a tank in your party because every class has multiple teleports available to it so your tank just gets ignored.  They have a lot of armor and health but what good is that if the AI just completely ignores them and uses teleports to go after your healer and damage dealers. You might think you can defeat this with superior tactics but there are just so many teleports you really can't put the AI in a position where it is forced to attack your tank.  On top of that the AI gets much faster cooldowns on the same spells that you have.  Your ability to knock down a target will have a 3-4 turn cooldown.  That exact same ability in the hands of the AI has a 1 turn cooldown so it can be used every single turn allowing the AI to put your party members in stun locks very often.  Good luck if you run out of either physical or magical armor.  And to make matters even worse the game has horrific loading times and still suffers multiplayer connection issues.  Expect to spend at least 5 minutes just loading your save.  Then your friends have to spend at least the same amount of time loading when they connect to you.  Saving takes at least half a minute most of the time even on a good machine.  And party members get timed out very often which requires them to once again go through the long loading process when they reconnect.  Very frustrating to deal with.  Putting the game on an SSD doesn't seem to help very much which is embarassing.  There are a lot of small issues that add up to a tedious experience as well.  Persuasion system is a step back from the first game (and I wasn't the biggest fan of that either) due to cost of the stat.  There are many times when a quest or objective is completed but only one member in the party has knowledge of that fact even though all of the characters were present and involved every step of the way, rather immersion breaking.  The magic pockets feature is extremely picky and doesn't seem to work with quest items and even some keys.  The AI always has an abundance of action points enabling them to take 3+ attacks during their turns even after moving.  The world itself isn't designed well enough to guide the players on a linear path even though if you try to go outside the path you should be following you will get murdered."
Rigel,170,14,0,April 29,Not Recommended,22.1,"I'll be honest: For the life of me, I don't get why people love this game so much. Clearly they do.... I am very, very obviously in the minority so far as opinions go here. But I played the first few hours of the first game and despised it, and decided to try this one out because a bunch of friends wanted in on it and I heard they fixed a lot of the pacing issues from the first game.  It's a carbon copy of the first game, near as I can tell. Mistakes included. The game world is INCREDIBLY cluttered, full of items and backstories and details that are not and never will be important. It has a ton of mechanics, only a fracton of which ever seem even slightly important. It has a bunch of characters with complex backstories.... most of which don't matter in the slightest. Every fight is either way too easy or way too difficult with no middle ground.   A ton of backstory is thrown at you almost immediately, more than you can possibly take in quickly and requires you to either slow your pace to a crawl - which is DEATH in a multi-player RPG like this where everybody needs to be paying attention and equally invested in the story, lest someone get bored - OR, for you to just skim through it as quickly as possible and have no earthly idea what's going on. A character early on got killed in cold blood by another character; I had no idea who either one was, or why I was supposed to care, though I obviously was meant to.   The mechanics, as I mentioned, are often over-complicated and irrelevant. There are food items everywhere, and crafting components, but they hardly seem worth the effort, so why bother having them at all? They're just more noise. The graphics are detailed, but usually display a whole lot of nothing, so everything just winds up looking messy. The NPCs try to come across as endearingly fleshed out and bold, but they come across way too strong right out the gate -before you care enough about them to WANT to hear them ramble or listen to their backstories - so every time you open conversation with a new one you just kind of sigh and dig in for a few more minutes of dialogue from people you don't care about, concerning a subject which may or may not have any importance at all. It makes me want to not talk to anyone at all, which is BAD for an RPG like this. It comes across more as work than enjoyment.  Characters can stick together and listen in on each others' conversations.... but as mentioned, a lot of the time the discussions don't go anywhere at all, and you have to either carefully pace things so that everyone can hear and understand it, or else power through, either ignoring the plot elements or being forced to explain it to everyone later.  The game just has way, way, way too much going on. You would think that would be a good thing - more detail and more mechanics means more interesting and unique potential interactions, right? But instead, the game just feels ike an outing at the garbage dump - full of stuff, but the vast majority of it not even remotely worth your time. Having lots of content isn't bad, but the pacing here is just.... miserable. Stuff needs to be introduced to players gradually, in managable segments, and when we are appropriately invested in those elements.   As it was, I was bored out of my mind the entire time my group was playing last night. To be fair, I was the only one who felt that way. Everybody else seemed to be having a good time, and the rest of the internet seems to love this game too. But, for the life of me.... I don't know why.  "
Kyotosomo,46,36,18,September 29,Not Recommended,2.9,"I think if you're REALLY big into super heavy RPGs or Dungeons And Dragons then you will absolutely LOVE this game; probably considering it one of the greatest games of all time.  But for the average person, you likely will not enjoy this game.  I did not realize going I'd have to sink in literally hundreds of hours if I were to play this game to completion not to mention how text heavy it'd be (which would be great if the story was captivating enough but it just isn't).  This game is also very complex, not in hard way though, in a you're going to have to spend a lot of time managing everything to get the most out of the expirience.  Now the amount of detail that has gone into this game is truly amazing, like seriously, this game is a work of art; but it is wasted on anybody not super into this kind of subgenre of RPG.  So once again if you are one of the few people into this kind of game you will be in love like seriously this is easily one of the greatest RPGs of all time in that subcategory; but for the average RPG lover myself included it'll be too overwhelming and you just won't find yourself having very much fun or will be too daunted by the unreasonable time sink you'd have to put in to truly play through and enjoy the game.

Scwigles,219,6,1,"December 25, 2017",Not Recommended,182.4,"Although I do think it's a decent game, I can't recommend it because of several aspects that are mostly personal bias.  1) The controls are god awful, it's simply clunky, unresponsive and me and my freinds have complained and made errors because clicking in one locations doesnt register properly and causes either movement or unwanted skill use. 2) The pacing is terrible, the begging is too slow and takes forever to start getting to the fun parts. I've had several times where either me or friends don't want to start another campaign together because tutorial island is an awful slog.  3) This game hates casters with a vengence, early game, casters dont do much, you cast a spell or two and have to wait 4 turns to anything again, and you dont even get a decent auto attack because staffs have a 1 turn cooldown for a basic magic missile? Really? The spells themselves are underwelming unless you stack casters to break though magic armor to start doing the debuffs and effects. Late game, so many enemies have just too much magic armor or just outiright immunity, and makes it pretty much not fun to be caster through the whole experience from start to finish.

Texas Ranger,83,4,1,March 14,Not Recommended,58.4,"Let's see, where do I start...  The controls are clunky. About a quarter of the time you don't click on what you want to click on. I've had characters run across the map instead of firing an arrow. This also applies to interacting with objects. Also, the inventory system is horrendous. Moving objects between characters is a complete pain, and you literally have to drag and drop if they're standing too close to each other (and the inventory screen 'conveniently' expands if you have lots of objects, so you might need to scroll between transfers). When trading, you can't key in the amount of cash you want to include in a trade so you're left with a scroll bar with ticks that are too large. Also, say you want to purchase an object for character 2, but character 1 is the one with the trading skills? If you change characters to take a look at their equipment, the trade closes.   It's buggy. I've had characters randomly lose the ability to talk to other characters - the dialogue boxes flicker on, then disappear, and you have to hunt for the latest save that isn't bugged.  It's slow. Like XCOM2, it wastes your time with pointless pauses between actions. A 'fight' can end up taking half an hour in the best case just because its so slow.  Lots of fake difficulty. There are plenty of fights where you simply can't plan ahead a turn or two, because some scripted event will take place. After you know it'll happen, you can exploit it and win. Typically, you're underpowered in fights, so its very luck dependent: if the AI 'decides' to focus your characters, you'll probably lose. Alternatively, if the enemy gets a few lucky rolls, it'll also wipe your party. And then you take another half hour for the fight because its so slow...  ""It's not hard. It's stupid."" Like flipping a coin until you get heads 100 times in a row is 'hard'."

It's a game about status effects and power combos and enemies with a whole lot of hit points.  The game doesn't reward you for clever combinations; those combinations are mandatory to succeed.  There are not enough fights to test the combos, either, so there is no learning as you go. Also, be preparing to scrap your first go at the game. Apparently, you can easily create a party that will not be able to succeed. I hear that the game gets easier but I'm not sure if I want to overcome the horrible experience I've had so far to find out."

Also apparently it crashes only while someone is engaged in something, be looting, talking, whatever. We turned off autosave because it would crash at the beginning of every autosaved fight and now we're saving only when we are standing still for like 10 seconds.  Act one was perfectly fine and had no issues, act two crashed very rarely, act three it got quite common and annoying and act four it was just every save, and he saves the game A LOT. It quickly became annoying and having to be reinvited to the game every 2 minutes made it game breaking for both of us."

Wolf Barrick,241,2,0,"November 12, 2017",Not Recommended,149.8,"Before I start, I want to say that I LIKE this game for the most part. This could have been much more great that it ended up to be, in my opinion of course. Just a side note: It's waaaay better to play this in single player even if Coop is available. Why? Well, I played with two other friends and we encountered many problems on the way, because the game seems to treat every character as a single player instance, so dialogs repeat for every single one of us and even Persuasion Checks has to be redone and since only one of us takes the Persuasion skill, everything goes to hell half of the time. That is really BAD! The game offers the choice of installing mods to ease up some of the, not so great, game mechanics. Too bad that those can corrupt your save file in a way that the game takes forever to load and your friends when joining (with the same mod installed) will have a huge desync problem. No hair, Nullify Resistances instead of Leadership, broken skills, an axe that for reason turned into a crossbow, a wooden figurine that is a spear that deals 2-3 damage... yeah, we've seen some weird stuff. We abbandoned the idea of playing coop again after this. Back to single player though, they made some changes from Dos1. Crafting does not require a skill, but it's still really poor in what you can do. You can craft yourself a new armor that has your level, but it would have been nice if you could create magic or even epic equipment to have some nice bonuses added to the, otherwise, fairly useless piece of junk you crafted. It would have been nice if I could improve my equipment through crafting too, outside of adding nails to boots, that was not bound to runes. Runes are nice, but I would have liked the chance to slot my equipment in order to fit them. They removed the Bodybuilding and Willpower skills and added the Physical and Magical Armor to protect you from ailments. Before we had a chance to being afflicted by CC statuses, now until your Armor is up you are completely immune to them. I seriously dislike this mechanism, the only thing that does is making enemies tankier and CC skills useless until you manage to break through their armor. No thanks, I know that having a chance calculated on a skill you have wasn't really great either, but I highly preferred that at that point. At least I could use CCs regularly to help me out. ""AI is smarter!"" Wrong, AI is either doing weird stuff or, especially during boss fights, shamelessly Cheating the system just to F*** you up. You have a maximum of 6 AP for turn, usually a normal character gets 4 AP a turn unless he has the Glass Cannon or Lone Wolf talent. You get a free point of movement if you have The Pawn talent. Well, you will see enemies move for kilometers and being able to use two spells (that usually costs 2 or 3 AP), move again and maybe even drink some tea out of spite of you. Everytime that happend I examined them with Loremaster 5 and found out that they had no Talents and their maximum AP was 6. Plus, some enemy doesn't seem to have any cooldown to his skills. That is just wrong... I get the idea of ""Battles are stacked against you"", but making the AI cheat to do that? That is just cheap, couldn't you do better than this? Let's not forget the times where a Melee opponent is able to strike you from way below you for reasons. I.E. ""Let's climb this ladder so he won't be able to strike my mage down since there won't be any line of sight!"", he attacked him anyway. Plus, if you play an undead character, nobody will know that you are one while in town an fully covered in armor. That is good, but if you enter combat, magically even the poorest sod in town will know that you are an undead and will cast upon you all sort of healing spells to wipe you out. That is cheap and dumb. Was the Loremaster skill on sale that everyone has it over the roof? I seriously disliked this. They added Character Tags in the game that adds unique dialog lines for your character and might help you doing some quests! Are they good? No. They're mostly useless and you won't need any of them except from Scholar and maybe Mystic. Scholar is direly needed if you want to complete all of the side quests you can find, Mystic is needed for one quest if I recall correctly and that's it. All the other Tags won't add anything to your game, the lines you say are quickly dismissed by the Npcs and won't open for you any Quest or available outcome of one. What was the point of them? Roleplaying the character. Sure, but it's pointless if most of the times your Tag choices doesn't create any consequence in the quest! Why should I bother? Combat mechanics are solid for the most part. Sometimes large enemies are an issue because of hitboxes, it happened to me that when I tried to hit an enemy, he would move for his animation and my character instead of attacking, moved to his side wasting an AP. Really want an Undo button for movement. I disliked the Source system a lot. Basically some skills, the higher tier ones, requires you to have and consume Source. You have a maximum of 3 points of Source that you can only acquire by stepping into Source puddles, using a Source fountain (there's only one for act, but it has infinite source in it) or using Source Vampirism on spirits, dead bodies or enemies if they are sourcerers. The skills you can use with source are good, but I felt way too limited since at some point every enemy mage will use Source Vampirism or Purge to drain you of all your source. Not a fan of Source, sorry. Quest wise the game offer you a lot of quests that you can complete. Too bad that there are a lot of quests, especially during Act 2 that are left unfinished and offers no satisfaction whatsoever and a feeling of ""That's it?"". There's a lot of breakable quests too. I lost count of the quests that didn't close in my journal because of reasons or quests that resulted in a dead end. It's nice that they added a lot of side quests, but it matters not to me if half of them are dead ends. Won't say anything on the story, since spoilers. I can say it's ok. The soundtrack is awesome, loved especially Lohse's song.  In conclusion, what I can say about this game is: Wait for an Enhanced Edition (if there's gonna be one) where MAYBE  they will polish this game and hopefully remove the problems I personally encountered. Otherwise wait for a sale, don't buy it at full price unless you really want to."
Neon Sears,225,2,0,"October 26, 2017",Not Recommended,12.5,"I tried to like it, but it just isn't very good to me. Clicking on literally everything is very annoying, the camera is extremely annoying at times, and as someone who likes to experience the entire game, not just bits and pieces of it, there are too many quests that I can't really do without ditching a party member for another one or getting side tracked by another quest. This also goes along with not being able to do much if you're wanting to play a lone wolf. Some quests force you to travel with a partner. I get that you still get the lone wolf perk with one other companion, but this doesn't change that there are like... 5 different options for companions, all with quests. I simply felt there was too much going on in the first part of the game. I've no doubt this review will get bashed, but that is simply how I felt about it. The environment is ridiculous as well. I was constantly using rain to get rid of oil, fire, poison, etc. It is extremely annoying. I never really died to anything due to fire or oil, poison killed a couple of my characters, but I still ended up winning. To me it just isn't very well done and is quite the chore."

HefBot 2.1,407,9,4,January 9,Not Recommended,77.7,"I've not yet finished this one. Despite the stupid number of hours I am into it on my first playthrough. 77.7hrs at time of writing.  It's not a bad game per se, it's just the flaws in its design just become so irritating by the end of the campaign that I found myself just going through the motions and hate-playing it simply to finish the damn thing.  I feel like if you stripped out the campaign and left the assets and the DM mode and just sold it at a much reduced price it would really nail it as a multiplayer CRPG.  The irritations that got worse as I played was the lack of actual freedom in the game. Both in terms of dialogue options having no appreciable difference and the way that quests are intended to be done in a specific order. For example, if you are just free wandering through the map and come across a hostile NPC that is 2 or more levels higher than you, just reload your quicksave and make a note not to go there until you're 1 level higher than it. In each chapter there's about a 3 level spread that you need to deal with, and quests should be knocked off from easiest to hardest if you're not comfortable cheesing the heck out of the AI.  Each level represents a huge step up in damage output, resistance and general ability. I feel this is the weakest part of a game that supposedly prides itself on player agency. If you got rid of levelling altogether and made combat all about efficient and clever use of skills/equipment then the combat would be amazing.  Another annoyance that only gets worse is the journal. It's so vauge as to what you should be doing next, who to see, what level each quest is, and even if a quest can be completed in the current chapter you're in are completely omitted. Most of the time I ended up having to look through the wiki to solve a lot of quests. Half of which weren't even in the current chapter!  The voice acting is good, the writing ranges from passable to good. The plot is extremely generic. The graphics are pretty enough. The bugs are plentiful and even with heavy patching I just don't see this game getting to a point where I can recommend it.  Hopefully with DOS3 Larian can get rid of the levelling system, add some quest markers or at least quest mechanics from this century. And maybe a shorter campaign with a story worth playing."

Szkeptik,216,7,4,July 16,Not Recommended,54.0,"As awesome as most of this game is I just can't recommend it because of the all-over-the-place difficulty it has. I play it on ""Classic"" difficulty (I guess it's supposed to be ""normal""). You might have a completely fun and interesting fight in one room, then move to the next and find yourself facing enemies with 3x more health and 2x more damage than your party have. They will often move first as well, and by the time the turn comes to you, your party is at half health and crippled/blinded/etc. I don't know if the devs intended these fights as a deterrant from higher level areas, but there's no indication that you are coming up against and unbeatable foe.   Not to mention a bunch of times the enemies will teleport in from nowhere with a proximity trigger like mechanism, so you can't even sneak up on them or know what you will be facing until you walk right into it. Even if you can somehow beat them, you can't do it immeadiately, but only after a couple of reloads when you already know exactly where they will spawn and what abilities they will use.  My personal assessment is that the level design was kind of sloppy when determining level progression and opponent difficulty. It's like you are always a level too low to face the next challenge and have to constantly backtrack to try and find some better gear or farm more XP in previous areas so you can progress.  I read that the solution is to itemise well, but the drops and market items are random, so you may or may not get the good stuff early. And if you don't you might as well start anew or reload some older save and try again because you will not be able to take on key fights. It reminds me a bit of the HoMM games where even on moderate difficulties you basically had to play a perfect game to have a shot at beating the AI.  All in all, unless you are some veteran RPG fan I'd definitely wait for a discount."

Meowsanthrope,9,No,0,July 25,Not Recommended,1.9,"I purchased this game, anticipating great things, and after having read a number of highly enthusiastic/promising reviews I felt comfortable shelling out for it. 20 minutes in it crashed. Curious, as my system met and exceeded all requirements, I started reading through forums where players were reporting all manner of crashes. There were HUNDREDS of posts--competant users who had done everything including re-installing drivers, turning down graphics--etc, despite their systems being able to handle it (I mean people were posting their system specs for FS. lol), and still the game crashed time and time again, despite their valiant and exhaustive efforts. I decided not to exceed my 2 hour allowance of game time and requested a refund. I would strongly advise anyone not to DL this game in lieu of these persistent crashes/issues, the developer's apparant unwillingness/inability to resolve said crashes is baffling. I am sorely disappointed as this game seemed to hold such a great amount of promise. In my opinion, no game that crashes repeatedly is enjoyable--reading through these user logs reminded me of playing Fallout Vegas on a PS3. *headdesk*"

gotothekitchen,105,No,0,February 21,Not Recommended,15.0,Game goes from fun to frustrating bug ridden mess pretty quickly. Often GUIs don't update properly and sometimes they update correctly in one place but incorrectly in another and then after opening and closing the windows you end up with the wrong value (example being sometimes gold from a trade getting added to the total value counter at the top but never making it into the inventory). Honestly looks like sloppy back end work which reminds me of work which isn't what I want from a game. I mean i'm sure the multiplayer aspect makes these kinds of things difficult but you really shouldn't slouch on something so important.

There are many users experiencing problems like ""Connection to the Larian support server failed"" along with several others. I tried scouring the forums for fixes. After four different fix attempts and a reinstall, the game still didn't work. The message from the devs on this was that they were looking into it...a month ago. Also, they recommend disabling anti-virus. I know you can grant special access to specific programs. The way they put it out, it was as if you should shut off your anti-virus completely. Just seems as if they didn't really give the problem due consideration and doesn't inspire confidence that they'd respond to user feedback either. It appears that many folks don't have this problem, however; I saw quite a few others on the forums in the same situation I'm in.

Kickass,64,5,0,"October 2, 2017",Not Recommended,163.1,"I hope there was a neutral button for this game.  It could be  a ♥♥♥♥ing epic game, however at this moment, I can tell u it's not. I really enjoy its story line, but the longer u have played, the more frustrated and angier u have gotten, because this game is containing a serious bug with missions, which caused your mission abort. I have wasted my half of the playing time because of it.  Pros: 1.******Great story******* 2.Nice Sound track 3.Mission rich 4.Outstanding combat style  Cons: 1. Missions bug, u couldn't finish the missions because of the missing dialogues' bugs. I encountered 8 mission bugs in driftwood (around 40 missions right there, 1/5 of the missions were abort at that time.), 6 in the Arya and 2 are about the main quests ( but lucky I could solve main story one by reloading the save.).  *** Really annoying*** u have to visit the game wiki online while playing this game, otherwise u got stuck. Save and reload couldn't fix the problem, even I restart the mission, the bug still caused your trouble. Thus, I had created 3 characters, one of them were deleted because of this ♥♥♥♥ing bug, another one's  for the experiment.  2.Dialogue/ sound suddenly went off. It could be another bug and need to be fix.  3.If you have ever played Fallout 4, then u are going to find out the same problem - Stupid dialogue option (not all of them, but it's around 40%), it usually lead to the same following dialogue whatever u have choosen differently.  For example, I was playing a male character, and there's a male npc blocking your way to enter the campus. At this moment, u had 4 choices( killing, persuasion, ***sexal attraction*** and leaving.) and I choosed the sexal attraction and it 's a success, but he described your male character as a female in the following dialogue, I tried this conversation with a female character and I got the same result. I am not sure it's a bug or not, so I gave another test with this npc ( High v.s. low persuasion), both of my characters still got the good result regardless the persuasion level.  4.Bugs on the buff states on your characters and allies. For example, a conjurer used a 2-turn damage buff on his pet.  1st turn: Pet action ended -> Conjurer used a 2 turns damage buff on his pet -> Turn end 2nd trun: Pet with dmg buff action ended -> dmg buff lost -> Conjurer turn -> Turn end Another example, u were attacked and got a burnning state by enemy. 1st turn: Hero action ended -> Enemy attacked your hero with fire ball -> U got a burning state (2 turns)  because of defeated magic armor -> Turn end 2nd trun: Hero action ended -> Hero burning state ( 1 turn) -> enemy turn -> Turn end 3rd turn: Hero action end -> Hero burning state lost -> ... There's the problem with the state turn counting between the + and - ve effect, + ve state last shorter than expected, hopefully, this is just a bug.  4. There's no difference on the enemy using charm / tanut skill, both skills cause your ally attack u. Charm- Causing your enemy attack his allies Taunt- Causing your enemy attack focus on u however, A taunted ally always choosed a high damage range skill or bomb to attack,  he wasn't focus on the enermy at all but on other heroes and dueling tons of damage on allies at that time. What a ♥♥♥♥ing joke!  5. Charm skill is♥♥♥♥♥♥ charmed enemy didn't do anything but walking around ( >50% time).  6. ♥♥♥♥ing stupid tags, different tags give different special dialogues, but only mystic and scholar tags are useful on the mission and u must have those 2 tags on the same chararcters to some missions. If u don't have a character with mystic and scholar tags at the same time, few missions u are going to miss or unsolve (only 1 or 2 can have an alternative way.). Two characters, who have mystic and scholar tags individually, couldn't solve the quest together, because u need a character with both tags. As a result, I have to build every character with those tags in each game.  What a regret on this game! I really wanted to recommend this game, but the mission dialogue bugs cause me wasting 50% of the gaming time, so I do not recomment this game at this moment, even it has a real ♥♥♥♥ing nice story. Unless there is a patch to fix the bug in the future, then I will recommend it."
devil,131,No,0,October 12,Not Recommended,112.7,"I'm not a fan at the moment, but that's just me. The game is pretty outstanding in most parts, but in the areas I bought it for, it seems to be quite lacking.  The role playing aspect looks pretty impressive. I'm not a big fan of some of that stuff personally, so I think a large part of the game has been lost on me. For example, the protagonist takes on a bit of a rebel/terrorist/survivor role early in the game and shortly after, I land in a new town/area. Someone from the corrupt law & order of the area calls me out! I've been identified! I have 3 options here. One is to surrender but that sounds lame, so I dont like that one. Second is to bribe them, but I want to hold on to my money so I don't like that either. Third is to attack the character who called me out, which I like! :D. But wait, the Entire Town goes hostile on me? Shop keepers to the beggers, everyone wants to kill me now... That quite sucks. From a role playing point of view, that makes sense I guess, but practicaly, this is a Terrible option! Totally lame! How often does an entire town go hostile if you pick the wrong dialog option? Why would they ever even put it there? Why would they put a mine in the middle of a peaceful road that insta-kills half your party? Why is there an area that enemies rediculously more powerful then you, 10 seconds of walking away from where you are supposed to be? Why is this bad guy who's 1 level higher then you able to 1-shot half your group?   Yeah, I felt like I had to reload my last quite save A LOT OF TIMES because of some variation of that. There are lots of ways to do things! But I felt a lot of them were a total waste of time.  So If you love role playing stuff, I think the game has a lot going for you.   Personally, I'm a big fan of the combat system and character development in RPGs. I had a lot of fun feeling like I was mastering the combast system in the first game and thought the new game would have the same combat system, or something basically the same but a bit more polished. Nope. Vastly simplified in my opinion and a lot less fun. I'm pretty sure that they wanted to more closely control the options that the player had for developing the plot, so they took a lot of complexity out of the combat system so that a level 10 creature can be beat by a level 10 party with a bit of focus, but no miracle. 1 level over? Pretty darn hard! 2 levels over? Just forget about it. 3 levels over? You're bascially trying to teach Mario how to swim in lava. The designers don't want to stop you from trying, but it's Very clear they don't want you going there. Likely because if you can skip areas, that will screw up your plot progression, which they put a lot of time and effort into.  It's like the game is giving me all these options of stuff I can do, wich is cool! But some of these options are apparently stupid and I shouldn't have picked them because I keep getting gibbed? Not a fan."

Enemies large amount of physical/magic armor on top of health allow them to walk through tactically placed status effects without effect. Enemies have high amounts of AP, less cooldown, and other cheats to straight up overpower your well thought out strategies. The game appears to only allow for a small subset of party combinations to be successful. Having little to no physical/magical armor in the beginning of the game is a huge handicap in combat.  The jump from classical to tactician modes is a huge leap. And it forces the player to cheese to even have a chance of passing. Expect a lot of reloads even on classical difficulty.   The random loot system often gives poor reward you end up vendoring.  A definite step down from the first. Wait six months to a year before buying this game."

Terrainosaur,26,34,11,August 19,Not Recommended,138.8,"If DOS2 was a tabletop RPG, it would be the worst Game Master ever.  STAGED TRAPS Every battle is a trick. A lone person can call reinforcements from off-map who run right up next to you while you're stuck there unable to react. THEN combat starts. Ambushes are the most common fight. Sometimes the enemies aren't even there. They appear out of thin air to shoot you. Some situations are scripted, killing your whole party. You either get around them with exploits or avoid them. It's amazing how enemies always go first and have tons of action points, but if you try to ambush one of their sentries, their friends detect it from ANY distance and come running. You struggle to improve your basic gear and spells while monsters blast you with spells that are hard to find or create. Every enemy seems to be able to make opportunity attacks, but you have to spend points to get that.  STRAY CLICK? RELOAD! Undetectable traps kill your party. One was underneath a crate I accidentally picked up. I heard 'Look out it's a trap' at the same instant as the explosion. I wasn't even trying to move the barrel, I was trying to open it. If you accidentally click an item in town, the nearby NPCs immediately get a worse attitude to you. Sometimes they attack you, from just a stray click. This is a common theme. I cast poison the ground so my undead character could step on it to heal, but I didn't notice that was his last action point, so my click on the poison sent my NEXT character to run and stand in it. Then he was poisoned, the opposite of what I was trying to do.  HEROES NEED NOT APPLY Many NPCs will attack you if you fail your Persuasion check, even when you thought you were on the same side. There are no consequences of playing a serial killer. Nobody walks into a building, sees the bodies, and alerts the town guard. Lots of online advice is 'Turn in the quest, then kill the quest-giver for more experience.' I saved a man's life, then tried to put out the fire on his house with spells. He said I was damaging his house and attacked me. You don't play a noble adventurer or wicked thief, you play a scavenger. You have to enter every abandoned house and mouse over every spoon to see if it's worth taking. There are countless situations you can't do anything about, but they're designed to make you feel bad. Orphaned baby animals, children with incurable diseases, the poor and starving ... while you're spending piles of gold on the next magic dagger. I tried to heal a beggar and got killed for it.  ROLL YOUR EYES AT THE QUESTS Some quests are impossible to start unless you talk to the NPC with the right party member, or you're carrying the right random object, or you choose the right dialogue options. And you get one chance. There are lots of bugged quests, and quests you can't complete for arbitrary reasons. Countless objects seem useful but aren't, but you have to be extra careful not to sell things that later turn out to be quest items. The lore is garbage. So many books you find are random scribblings that have nothing to do with the story. Look at the title, it's a clue. 'Divinity Original Sin 2' doesn't tell you anything. The game encourages you to use exploits. It encourages you to break it not with tactics but with tricks like 'Teleport your whole party into a prison cell, then teleport the guards in, killing them one at a time. The guards don't have the key to the door! #lolsocool'.  AN EXPERIENCE LIKE CHEWING GRAVEL Expect to spend hours managing your inventory. No, you can't label bags to easily find your herbs. The load times are long, and I'm running it on a new gaming PC. The number of ridiculous, annoying tricks means you'll need to save and reload often. There's no way to speed up the animations. When the enemy summons skeletons which then summon more skeletons, you sit there for MINUTES before you get to act.  In short, Divinity Original Sin 2 is boring and annoying. There's so little PLAYING in this game. It's a non-stop joyless deathtrap designed to make you feel bad - while spending hours saving and reloading. I think the designers actively hate their own customers."
ElevatorEleven,203,3,4,March 19,Not Recommended,95.7,"The last time I played this game was a few weeks ago. I realized this when I noticed it again in my library today and came to the conclusion that I probably would never finish it.  I quite like this game actually. It promises rich story and narrative directed by player choice and obviously falls flat just like every game that promises such, but I could have gotten past it. Obviously a game can't have total freedom, and to its credit, Divinity Original Sin 2 has more freedom than most RPGs in several ways that can create some good fun.  The combat is nice too, turn based so slow at times, but with an emphasis on the planning and spatial strategy which compliment the lack of intensity. Battles must be won with careful tactics and preparation as well as using the current status of the environment to your advantage. A rain spell can make the ground wet, a contamination spell can poison the water, any fire spell can ignite the poison, another rain spell can turn the fire into concealing steam clouds, a lightning spell can electrify the clouds, etc.  Mechanically the game is alright, though not above bouts of occasional ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t when targeting and pathing and line of sight are concerned, but the narrative elements left me cold. Dialogue is a bit too ham for my taste and quality of writing is a few rungs lower than what I'd call acceptable, and it still ultimately trips over itself by promising too much freedom. By mimicking the style of tabletop as hard as it does it only shoots itself in the foot repeatedly when I keep thinking of things I ought to be able to do but the game engine won't let me.   A few examples jump to mind as particularly galling; near the start of the game a Bad Guy argues with a lady at the city gate and they give some exposition before the Bad Guy kills the lady and then leaves. It's possible to get into the town another way so the event doesn't trigger, and they stand there at the gate arguing basically forever until you come back. So it's possible to come back at a higher level once you've learned the spell that lets you teleport other people around. My first thought was to teleport the lady away so that the Bad Guy can't kill her, but the Bad Guy's attack apparently has infinite range, goes through walls, and doesn't require line of sight. One might suppose ""oh but clearly you're using an exploit if you get around this scripted event and try to come back to it later when you have a spell you shouldn't have."" But you'd be wrong, because it's possible to defeat the Bad Guy right there and she has dialogue for it and drops her super powered hammer, so obviously the designers intentionally made this possible but didn't think I'd try to save the doomed NPC.  I could list others, but really this isn't that big of a deal. For every time my friends and I got to say ""Man, they really should let us do this thing"" there were a good one or two times we got to say ""Boy I'm so glad they actually let us do this thing."" No, what made me put the game down was at the end of the first major chapter when I had the distinct displeasure of meeting Malady, an arrogant, boring, snotty and smug insufferable and invincible DMPC so obnoxious and poorly written that after being forced to spend the next hour of the game with her I could no longer bring myself to care what happens next in this story or to this world or to any of these other characters.   Every pretense the game had to offering me freedom was immediately shoved aside so the author's pet character could have the spotlight instead. An insurmountable problem appears (which I was well on my way to resolving on my own) and she insists we retreat because there's no way YOU could beat this enemy you silly little peasant, and I can't tell her to♥♥♥♥♥♥off and let me win this fight without her, she teleports us away and I can't call her out on it. She constantly acts completely bored with my saving the world from annihilation, she rubs it in my face how mysterious and wise she is like she has all the answers but won't tell me any of them, and if I even try to refuse to talk to her, she basically mind controls me into telling her what she wants to know. And of course, when I attack her, she just shrugs it off, turns invisible (preventing me from talking to her for a minute or two until she comes back, which stalls the game because talking to her is literally the only way to advance), and says ""Please, just don't"" like my attack that took off a third of her health in one hit somehow only bothered her as much as if I were a four year old kicking her in the back of the leg because obviously she's just so cool you guys. No other character has been invincible up to that point; you can kill shopkeepers, guards, random civilians, even the NPCs you can get to join your party if you talk to them, everybody you meet except for the children, which, fine, whatever, people get pissy if you let players kill children in your game I guess.  So naturally I immediately saved and quit and went to look up how to kill her and it looks like you can but only in a story cutscene somewhere so it's still on the author's terms and leads to a bad ending or something, and keeping her alive and talking to her a whole lot seems to be the only way to stop one of the recruitable NPCs who I kind of liked from dying later. Or something. I don't know the details of course, and I no longer care. I have the impression she would only get worse, and my involvement in the story would only decline as she took more and more center stage, because that's the kind of character she is, and even if I'm wrong about this it's already too late. Malady was such an awful and offensively trite character that she broke the spell, and my trust in the author is gone.  If you're some kind of deranged mutant who would like to explain to me why Malady is your waifu and are presumably someone who's never played Dungeons and Dragons with a crappy DM so you don't know how to spot one and haven't had the chance to ever feel that particular brand of hate and impotence, feel free to leave a comment and I will not read it."

Have tried all suggested options of saves and reloads but no way past it. As such, the game is now unplayable until this bug is fixed. Anxiously awaiting further updates to fix problem. I recommend this game in its classic format."

tntwhovian,103,11,0,October 14,Not Recommended,28.7,"The first game was amazing. Sometimes very long and you could lose your way a bit, but overall great. This sequel lost everything that made the first so fun and unique. 1. Character decisions no longer affect the character at all. There's very little interaction between the characters period and few to no choices.  2. It's too easy to get into fights you cannot possibly win from the very beginning. The first game was about strategy and you were never forced into a confrontation you couldn't win. You could avoid it or put it off or do any number of things (with one exception). This game forces you into them ALL THE TIME. It's so stacked for the enemies it's ridiculous. Charmed characters can go through and use all your scrolls and anything in your inventory? BS.  3. It is ridiculously hard to find anything useful in the world. No potion bottles, no craft items, no place to cook. Resurrection scrolls are vital (considering how many OP opponents you face from the beginning) but ridiculously scarce. I've been stealing anything of value anywhere I go and I still have barely enough to do anything when I happen to run across useful items being sold.  4. It's almost impossible to figure out what you're supposed to be doing when. Map markers don't update, quests logs aren't even quests with directives.   5. The armor system completely removes the game from the original, more DNDesque combat type. In the original, status effects were based on a combination of %chance to resist (from your character stats) and %chance to succeed (also from stats) and then a random number roll from the difference. It meant needing to be flexible and have more strategy and plans because you couldn't guarantee a status would take effect. Now you have to deal with a disappointing selection of armor for yourself and enemies with 4x as much armor as you and status effects that will always ♥♥♥♥ you over.  6. The attribute and skill system was simplified so much it removed any nuance or character balancing. A tank can just stack on constitution and vitality and warfare and do nothing else. Except the combat makes tanks almost pointless anyways because you can only taunt right next to you and the enemies are never even mostly right next to you.   tldr; this is a terrible version of the first game, aka a typical disappointing sequel"
Amigo,142,14,2,"September 21, 2017",Not Recommended,81.6,"""I have a study to explore...""   If there's a single word to describe this game, that would be the word ""TEDIOUS"". I didn't like the first one. I thought it was overrated. I wanted to try this one partly because there were no new RPGs around. I wish I didn't. This game is the same chore as the first one. Playing this game for me is like grinding through many obstacles just to catch a glimpse of that old role playing feeling which this game certainly has.  The story. At it's core it's really similar to that of Baldur's Gate. Take Bhaalspawn and put Godwoken instead. You even start at a prison. Except the story in Baldur's Gate felt epic. In this game it doesn't. In Baldur's Gate 2 you had the prison, the huge city of Alkathla with it's several districts, de'Arnise Hold, Umar Hills, Trademeet, Spellhold, City of Caverns, The Underdark, Forest of Tethir Areas, Windspear Hills, Suldanessellar, The Nine Hells. What do you have in this game? I don't know really. 2-3 maps? Oh yeah, I forgot. You have a study to explore!  The voice acting. I have no idea why they made the decision to voice act every single dialogue line in this game. Was it really necessary? They wanted to impress people and boost sales? They had an excess of money to spend? This was not necessary. Like everyone in this game speaks such perfect English it's ridicuolus. Lizards speak like they are gentlemen from Westminster Abbey. Skeletons - the same. All characters sound similar. That's not what's called good voice acting. Like come on all you had to do was to add a little flavour to voice acting. Make lizards have their own manner of speech. The same for skeletons and elves. Probably dwarves too. Just voice act one line of dialogue but add flavour to it and make it count. In this game everyone sounds as generic as they can. I still remember the voice acting of one character from Baldur's Gate 2 - Tortured One, in a prison. Or Minsc. Was he fully voice acted? No, but he was so alive and had a tremendously distinctive character. With vocie acting in this game all characters can transform into a single word blob.  The pacing. It's extremely slow. Fights take forever to finish. Characters move like they are premanenlty overburdened. Every turn of the road on the map has containers/enemies/NPCs. It is the core design. To create less and to make it feel like it's a lot. Even that ghost vision. Man, it's such cheap trick. Press a button and you'll get another bunch of characters to interact with in the same places you've already been. ""But, I have a study to explore!"", you say. Indeed you do.  The gear. Gear in this game? Honeslty I felt like I was playing an MMO. Who gives a sheet? You find a so called ""legendary"" item in a chest, equip it. And then you find a blue item which is better in a chest next to it. It's just swapping gear with higher stats, that's what it is. There's no excitement in finding a new good item because you know that soon you will find a new one, a better one.  Progression system. We all know RPGs are about getting your character to new heights, learning new powers, abilities, etc. The important thing for developers is to make a player feel powerful as he progresses and develops his character. Yes, this game has a ton of abilities and powers. Yes, you do progress and get new ones. The issue is you don't feel powerful. There's always a group of mobs with higher level than you ready to make a meat stew out of you. Every fight is a tedious struggle with enemy at advantage. It makes all your glorious efforts feel a bit useless.  I could go on pointing out other weak spots of tediousness in this game. Like inventory system (oh my God, it's awful!), companion management, UI in general, crafting (what crafting? wait, there's crafting in this game?) etc. But it all comes down to this. If you are a masochist hungry for a new RPG and not afraid of grinding your way through inconviniences with a snale's pace, be my guest - buy this game, play it, explore a new study. Otherwise - AVOID, save your time. Wait for other RPGs."
AARosson,975,6,1,"December 28, 2017",Not Recommended,12.9,"Divinity: OS2 has a lot of promise but in my eyes fails in one way that breaks the game. The enemies Scale to your Lvl. This might seem like something good to keep the game challenging but breaks the game when you realize no matter how many side quest you do, you will never be strong and gaining levels only hurts you. What’s the point of progression if you are always just as strong as everyone else...?   The game has good bones, its engine works great and makes you wish they could have made a D&D or Pathfinder game rather than the story given mostly because it seems like the developers didn't care to much about it. I have a hard time caring about the story because if you have played other Divinity games you find that they have changed the nature and back stories of the races in it. I loved playing Dragon Commander because I got to learn about the generals, politicians, races, and your wife in the game. If you played Divinity 2 you learned a lot about the races in the world of Divinity and it seems like all that got thrown out.  Does the game look pretty? Yes. Does the combat work well? Yes? Does the game have an interesting Story? Yes?  But I can Also Say,  Combat works well but you will never feel strong or any need to become stronger because the enemies will just be stronger.  The Game looks pretty but when you put on a hat you grow long hair and your face changes.  The interesting story, if you start asking questions and talking to everyone, contradicts its self and changes. The story jumps all over the place and makes you wish you could just pull out a fishing pole and fish at the ocean and forget the story all together.  In general, I love RPG's and I hate that I hate this game but that is that.   I am also appalled at all the great reviews. The game is not a perfect game by any means regardless if you liked it or not it has a lot of problems, reviewers today need to be more honest.  Why is this game getting 10/10? It’s not a 10/10… I rate things either Unplayable or Playable.   This game is unplayable.  As in, I didn't find it fun and what is the point in playing if its not fun. "

In another fight I was stuck with zero AP just because I used Fane's Time Warp (another well known bug).  I gave up the game at end fight just because I could not take it any more. Too much frustration with all the stupid bugs."
Jynx,122,17,1,"September 16, 2017",Not Recommended,93.4,"This game is not just not that fun to play. Everytrhing feels needlessly complex without a real payoff. The menus are a pain to slog through. I constantly struggled to get the camera in the right spot to see anything. And good luck findning anything. You have to press a key to see items and that doesn't show half the stuff you actually want to pick up. For such a complex game, you really need extensive intro to game mechanics to have the faintest clue what is going on and that is not present.  Just as an example, lets say you want to sell items. Great, so almost every NPC you meet is a vendor with some gold and items to sell. So that means you have to click on every NPC to see what theyre selling. And when you want to sell you have to move all the gear to the character with the bartering skill so you can sell it at max price. Theres a good chance that all your gear is actually on the character with thievery (because he steals stuff and opens chests) or the one with high wits that you use to spot hidden treause and traps. So have fun moving all your gear between characters that all have individual carrying capacity and inventories full of potions and scrolls.  This game seems to be meant for a small subset of gamers that like a really heavy story-driven rpg with super complex mechanics and don't mind all the difficulties that come with no limits on what you can do. There's a reason conventions like group inventory or merchant NPC's or skill trees exist - they save the gamer time so they can go do the fun stuff like exploring the world and story. Suffice it to say, I see the promise in this game and if some of its underlying gameplay was changed to be more user friendly I would gladly enjoy the story. Instead I feel set adrift among a host of unexplained, needlessly comlex game mechanics without direction as to where to go or if I'm doing something wrong."
Shabby,165,9,3,February 12,Not Recommended,111.3,"Cant recomend. While the first act is tight and well crafted, offering you some inetersting story bits as long as you are willing to search for them and have the right NPC for them. But to be honest the whole game goes down hill fast once you get to level 5-6 because some major things happen. Crafting becomes usless, you will never need to craft anything in the game (Except a rare potion if you are not running hydrosophist), nor can you upgrade your arms and armor anymore as you could in the first game. Now, lets encounter an interesting thing i found in this game near the end of the act 1. You will find and fight a particular npc, and i made sure he was dead, i killed him, made him explode in a burst of blood smoke and meat bits, as well as tearing off his face. Yet he apears alive and well a few seconds latter, while the NPC around it say: ""Yeah, you did not kill him, he is allive."" And once you kill him again the NPC go: ""Yeah... he escaped, his boddy disapeared."" At this point i realised that you cant kill any important NPC and nothing you say will influence the main story except at  particular key points. In another addition to problems of this game is: The tone is harsher, but it does not work for the story the game tells. Going in to minor spoilers the game deals with the questions of faith, trust, divinity (obviously) and use of mass weapons of destructions, bloodshed, racism, religious zelotry and just cruelty. I think you can see why the tone can be incosistent and why the grimer and darker tone does not work for the tail of Faith, Trust and Divinity. And the game really tries to keep hammering down the point that: ""THIS IS A GRIM WORLD, WE WANT TO BE LIKE DARK SOULS!"" But its more like salt and sanctuary, throwing strung up corpses and skeletons and other gory stuff to create an atmosphere. The perks got cut down and now there is way less of them and some of them are just pointless, like ice king and demon, or ambidextry and slingshot.  Persuasion boiled down from a little game of rock, paper, scissors in to a skill check that... granted, makes no god damn sense. If there is a persuaion event you will get dialogue options that will have [Strength], [Dexterity] or [Intelegence] or any other stat before them, and you know what? They might as well have removed those little stamps, because they do nothing, if you have 50 strength and the persuasion event requieres 1 persuasion and you have 0, you will loose. Some of them are imposible and some of them are an auto pass, and while it does make sense, it points to the fact that there is no need in having persuasion as your social stat, especially considering that you get so few points. Socail skills (or stats): The only ones you need are Lucky charm, Thievery and Loremaster. Everything else is usless, and not like it even matters, you can change your character stats any time you want once you get in to the second act. What else? What else? Ah, yes, the armor. Its an awfull idea, while the first game was more about resistance and chance, this game goes bananas and says: Its all or nothing! So you can get yourself stunned for 8 turns in a row and hate your life. Also there is... something going on with the game where you can get stunned or frozen out of nowhere. The quests are rather boring and there is not much way of completing them other then the single way it was ment to be finished. Some of them cant even be finished, for some reason. In addition i must add that there are major techincal problems like the game taking 5 GB of ram and dying, on the regular bases, stutters and freezes, and some times your saves might actually not save, so check for that twise, i lost about 4-5 hours of progress in a coop game because of that. The second act is a mess, its just a bunch of stuff thrown around with no direction, its like your high scool budy wants to create a DnD sandbox adventure, and does not make any hooks for quests, so you end up aimlesly wondering around and talking to NPC in search of a thing to do. Companions are wierd, while i have been playing a lone woolf with Ifan on my side i found that he takes my acts of friendship like an excuse to put something up his bumm. At one point we got in to a conversation at one of the ins, he got himself and my character a cup of ale (or beer, does not matter), and procided to make conversation, at one point he said: ""Its good to have you by my side"" or some such, and i decided to answer: ""I enjoy your company"", now i thought its going to be like: ""Yeah, its nice traveling with you, you are after all of great assist in battle and your sharp wits keep our spirits up during the travel"" Ifan took it as: ""You want smash?"" and procedeed to blush. I might add that i was playing a 2.4m male bright red lizzard. So the only one receaving smashing would be Ifan.  So far i got to the end of Act 1 and... i really cant recomend the game for any one looking for a good time with an RPG, i would rather sugest playing the first game and droping it half way thro. Thats the best time you are going to get with this series."
Lithbane,37,9,3,"December 24, 2017",Not Recommended,106.4,"I was gonna write this long post about what basically ruins this game for me. Again, my opinion, don't get triggered. I think this is the most overhyped and poorly made cashcow of a game ever. The devs were so lazy in making the quests that even murdering every NPC in all of Rivellon doesn't even matter, they just respawn in each act with crippling alzheimer's syndrome making them forget it all. I dropped a deathfog crate in act 4 on top of all the paladins and they just kept walking into it giving me that sweet, sweet EXP. Then some random paladin woman asked me if I was behind the murders, which of course I denied, being a lone wolf character on the hardest difficulty and having maxed out finesse because stacking archers in this game with finesse + wits is entirely broken in every way conceivable, especially when Fane can just grant himself another turn after the first and always be first because wits = initiative. And I succeeded in convincing her that I was, in fact, not behind the murders of her ENTIRE PALADIN ORDER because I had 5 in persuasion, basically the only stat you need to max out every time. This kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥happens throughout the entire game, with most NPC's literally being useless and lifeless with no character traits whatsoever. Combat is a complete joke, rogues/summoners/necromancers don't even need to exist. Polymorph needs 2 points to access every broken spell in the game. The entire game's story has these insanely stupid plotpoints that are supposed to be shocking, like Dallis being Fane's daughter (foreshadowed exactly nowhere and cared about by exactly noone). It's like they are missing 50 pages of text in this game. I have so many examples of the bad or straight up missing writing in this game, it's like the devs used most of the budget to go on pool parties or something.   So basically, combat sucks on any difficulty (with tactician + honor mode basically being ""ENEMIES HAVE 50% MORE HP"" sort of lazy, typical♥♥♥♥♥♥that you should never find in a carefully crafted RPG such as this one). The story is a sad, unfunny joke, with few redeeming characters that actually make you care about them (only Lohse and Red Prince to my knowledge have proper endings to their stories, both being decently written. Beast's story can actually proceed without him being alive and end the exact same way it does if he was.) There are far, FAR too many characters that are interesting at first glance but, woops, look at that, some pages went missing! Too much effort to find those it seems! From Lucian himself to basically an entire camp of EXP fodder characters with barely any story related to them or ways to finish quests related to them without just straight up KILLING them. But oh, this game was definitely carefully crafted and wonderful, especially the part where I could teleport NPC's while talking to them with one character and make most fights an even bigger joke than they were initially. And finally, gear in this game is the most pathetic attempt at skipping work I have seen. They basically just put RNG loot everywhere and didn't give two flying ♥♥♥♥s about making more custom weapons or armor that are actually worth getting BECAUSE OF THE RNG LOOT EVERYWHERE. I also love it when talents become useless past the point where they clearly stopped trying, which is basically act 2, because they just couldn't be asked to  write anymore quests that are worth a damn (R.I.P Pet Pal). And let's not forget the always useful and prefered talents such as ambidextrous, which is great for when you want to do a grenade only playthrough with a one handed weapon only! Oh wait, that sounds tedious and stupid? Well, sucks for you, most talents ARE tedious and stupid, with no real usage over obviously better ones (Bigger and better). This game is only truly likeable by hardcore fans and people who tend to be bad at RPG's. Also those who like to delude themselves they didn't buy a crappy product that clearly has way less merit than people brandish it with.  TL:DR Combat sucks, story sucks with some small exceptions, class and talent balance sucks, difficulties suck, detailing on the world is poor gameplay wise and nothing you do has any impact on the ending and most, if not all of the game, including purging all of Rivellon for EXP GAINS is entirely viable and goes unpunished in any way. Voice acting is amazing though.  Final thoughts, do not buy this game if you like good story, a real, fair challenge or have played basically any other RPG with above toddler level difficulty enabled. Buy it if you have already managed to find the missing 100 pages of backstory and quest dialogue, as well have an idea how to patch the game into some form of balanced state where I can't oneshot the final boss in two turns on the hardest difficulty. Or, you know, if you just really like good voice acting."
Reb0,54,15,4,September 28,Not Recommended,197.7,"This game can not be rated with a simple recommend / don't recommend option.  Divinity 2 is a very odd game. It probably is the single best isometric rpg for it's first 2 acts and then drops in quality. Hard.  Sadly even the definitive edition did little to fiix this. The combat system of d2 is briliant. The plot is great. the love for detail in the first 2 acts is awesome.  BUT: The 3rd act is an insult to people who played through the first 2. Questlines are not written out, there are uncharacteristic plot twists and very limited room to make any choices. The only logical choice in this act always seems to be ""just kill everybody"" as choices are just that black and white. The last act is again much better however disappoints in the end. Because d2 has no ending. The game just stops. The story is not concluded, your descisions seem to have had little impact in the final ""what happens after..-scene"", character developement seems to not have happened in the epilogue... a very confusing and lackluster climax of what could have been one of the all time greatest.  Voting ""don't recommend"" to even the odds here. In truth the game is very much worth your time, even if only for the first 2 acts. You can drop it after that."

大声笑大声笑,128,4,1,April 22,Not Recommended,9.3,"Positives +Good dialogue system. +Many places to explore. +Interesting story. +Can be fun at times. +Vast amount of quests to complete.  Negatives -The combat system.  This in my opinion is the biggest issue with the game. The combat system in this game is if you were to take Pokemon and mix it together with Dota 2/LOL. The biggest issue with this system is you can't explore certain areas that you would like to go to or have a quest in that location because there is 4 or 5 enemies that are 1 level higher than you. That doesn't seem bad but the levels in this game are brutal. If you and your group are just 1 level below the enemy then the fights are near impossible. You also can't just go past the enemies because you are forced to fight, as soon as the enemy sees you. You are not able to run past them and the most you can do is walk away a certain distance and teleport to the nearest waypoint and when you go back you will still have to fight the enemies in that area but they start with all of their health. The fighting itself is very boring,when you and your group start a battle to actually hurt them you need to destroy their magic or physical armor or both, spending on what attacks you plan to use.  Overall, this combat system is frustrating and boring, because of this I can not recommend this game."
RigWrecker01,9,7,0,"November 16, 2017",Not Recommended,28.3,"It's not often that I find a game virtually unplayable but this one qualified.   Pro's  It looked pretty good and did share many of the design and art style aspects of the early top-down RPG grinders.  There was a lot of voice acting that was quite good (but eventually turned into a con) There was a lot of flexibility in character generation.  Con's  Some games are open-world. Everyone knows what it means and entails. This game takes that to another level by providing virtually no prompts or feedback at all. You can happily wander into one deadly fight after another with no idea what you are doing. This is fine up to a point but it can get very tiresome very quickly and if your unlucky with a save you could find yourself in a world of hurt.  The journal quickly becomes tedious and can be a liability, particularly given the above. It's more a backstory with useful hints. Some parts of it are backed up with quest markers but getting there can be a lottery as you'll generally have no idea what you're going to find.  The map is hideous. I admit I am a bit OCD about game maps but this one takes the biscuit. The mini-map somehow manages to run counter to the main map forcing you to cross-reference constantly. The main map is about as vague as you could get away with while still calling it a map.  The visual perspective is very limited. It can be switched between a literal top-down i.e vertical and a viewpoint that basically forces you to use the map to orient yourself. This is both inconvenient and fairly oppressive after a while.  The voice acting. This seems like a great thing initially but before long you might find yourself thinking ""Get.To.The.Point."" as every character seems to want to tell you their life story without actually giving you much if anything to work with. Anything that is useful goes in the jornal forcing you to read it. Again. You can see what they were trying to do - give the game some life and character but too much of a good thing...  Inventory management. It can be broken down into categories but that doesn't really help much. Again the main issue is a lack of feedback. Take the hot-bar - there's no indication what items are on it when looking at your inventory. You might think 'So what?' but the point here is these little feedback loops make the difference between intuitive and hard work and this game does hard work really well. Another example of this is food. You would think that having lived in the game world and eaten game world food, you'd have some idea what to expect. Nope. A lot of it has to be identified before you can safely use it. Rare items, fair enough, but everyday stuff is just silly. This is work for works sake.  Combat is a chore. Not hard, I don't mind hard and will dark souls all day. No, this is a chore. You'll often find yourself totally outclassed no matter what gear you've picked up or what strategy you try and use. Part of this is because you'll start a fight with one or maybe two characters but soon find yourself swamped by five, six, seven....you get the idea. There is no way out of those situations so you're only option is go again. Even if you stick it out and survive there's a realistic limit to the number of times you can ressurect and the odds of carnage don't go down as you lose characters. Escape is said to be an option but I never got it to work once the fight started.  The other option is sneaking around avoiding fights. The problem with this is it's unreliable, plus this is an RPG not a stealth game.   You can take all of this as sour grapes if you wish but if you hit half the issues I found I'd lay odds you will regret buying this game. Sure it mimics the early top-down grinders pretty well and yes it looks a lot better. But I can't help thinking there's a reason we moved on from those games and this game will almost certainly give you a good idea why.            "

Loȝan Rooke,465,10,0,"September 20, 2017",Not Recommended,90.3,"Final major edit: The game past Act 1 simply isn't finished. It's not polished at all.  Dialogs are wrong/missing, quests won't trigger/are broken, plots can't be progressed. Characters won't recognize you did something downstairs, NPCs spawn as the wrong model, combast are imbalanced as can be, etc. etc.  The first 20 hours of the game is perfect, Fort Joy is divine. The rest needs a lot of work and attention to bring it up to that level of quality. Get this game on sale down the line and it'll blow your mind once it has been tidied up.  Quest updates are out of whack. Interactions with companions are HORRENDOUSLY shallow. It basically is one of two things - take *one* step per act towards their quest. Other than that, you and your companions make a remarka bout things that happen. It's A or B. A is ""i agree with the thing"" or B is ""I disagree with the thing."" That's it. Your companions have no dialogs of depth or character development otherwise at all.  You'll get randomly stuck in dialog windows and unable to leave them. You'll be oneshotted before combat even can begin and the only way to win is by cheesing with metagame knowledge.  Don't get me wrong, the first 25 hours of this game was the MOST fun I've had in any game. If DOS:2 finished after Fort Joy I would have been disappointed at the length but happy with the game.  Everything after Fort Joy has been a hot mess that has gotten only messier and hotter. I feel nothing but frustration when NPCs repeatedly fail to recognize things I have done. That guy? I already talked to him, I can't kill him. No, I can't talk to that person for you, they're dead. Yes, I have both halves of this item you want, but you don't recognize it.  It's a lot of sloppy, sloppy stuff that should have been cleaned up before proper release. Larian should apparently have put the whole game out there for EA, because again, Fort Joy is AMAZING. It's perfect in balance and completeness. There were only a few little tiny frustrations or things that were out of whack with dialog or quests.. but that was the exception to the rule. In act 2, it becomes the rule. The game becomes a sloppy, slipshod mishmash of frustration.  Some boss encounters hit less hard, have less health, and less armors than the first mobs you fight off the boat into act 2. They're eyerolling-ly easy. And this wild variation in balance becomes the new norm. It's just.. so frustrating because the game was absolutely, perfectly wonderful for the first 20-some hours, but it tanks so hard. Going from a 10/10 to a 6/7 out of 10 is a big drop, it's disappointing. Until they take time to polish up the majority of the game after Fort Joy, I can't recommend it."
CrankyCoon,357,4,0,"September 29, 2017",Not Recommended,100.9,"I think the game is a pinacle of of RPG games with the plot, depth, freedom, and customization that it can have.  It's a shame it's a buggy mess which makes it a pain to play, especially in multiplayer.  Saving and loading shouldn't take forever.  Saving shouldn't cause other players to crash in the game.  The hot bars should work properly.  Skills shouldn't randomly be added and removed.  I love the game, I enjoy playing it.  But the bugs which aren't addressed ruin the experience completely.  For a game meant to really immerse yoursef in the experience, the bugs create a really jarring experience.  Also, puzzles in games like this ruin the gaming experience.  It slows it down and doens't have a purpose in a game like this.  It's a shame too.  It's a wonderful game otherwise."

0000000,91,11,0,"September 13, 2017",Not Recommended,28.3,"Good, classic CRPG gameplay (with just a BIT too much emphasis on environmental effects, which at the lowest or highest levels can overpower all of your leveled-up and carefully decided weapons/spells/etc), with poor story telling.  The reason why Divinity always had an asterisk next to it (and why I never finished the original while finishing Dragon's Age Origins probably 5x or so) is because I never got the story, or, to be more precise, its setting. It was always very 1, cringey (Cyseal is a cringy name for a town, please, stop it with the lower class dumb English accents, same patterns persist here as well), 2, weird and scattershot (you'd have Colonial-era boats intermixed with swords and spells-type aesthetic, you'd have all kinds of races in the story with little rhyme or reason), there never seemed to be any reconciled, singular story of the ""world"" as it was, that made sense, like LOTR does, like DA:O does, like WOW does, like all of these pretty straightforward Fantasy settings do, 3, weird (the names ""Divinity"" and ""Original Sin"" always evoke parallels with the Bible, and I don't know about you, but for me the Bible is about as much at odds with Fantasy as anything can possibly be)  So please, whoever is in charge of the franchise, get rid of it. The legacy of the setting is so strong that it poisons everything around it. The ""Divinity"" franchise came out of the Divinity: Dragon Commander game, which doesn't sound like a good foundation to build ANY fantasy epic on. That's not a game to be used as a blueprint for future games, especially in the RPG genre for F's sakes.   Restart the franchise with a setting and a narrative system that MAKES SENSE, because I immediately disconnected from the first game, even though it was STRAIGHT up my alley, just because of how cringy and awful the setting was. And no, you can't patch it up and call it done, get rid of all of it, and start with a map, a world, a few races, a crisis, some supernatural figures maybe, and that's it. Look at LOTR or DA:O for reference. I just can't recommend a game with a story in this disastrous state."
Barabus the Grey,175,11,9,October 9,Not Recommended,42.8,"I am not quite sure where to start, as a long time CRPG player from the first Baldurs Gate to planescape torment and ice wind Dale etc, I find myself frustrated and board with this game. Now please note that I really wanted to like these games and I think I have given them a fair shot as i stopped DOS 1 on the 3rd act and this game on the 2nd. Firstly I got interested in this series because of all the Baldurs Gate comparisons and yet this game does not in any way feel similar or even distantly related to those games. The advertising was just complete BS, by trying to lure in the RTWP crowed and I feel a bit betrayed and sucked in. And the developers themselves saying this game is our Baldurs Gate 2 haha, sorry bros but DOS 2 can't even scratch BG2 butt let alone compete with it. In fact I find it kind of insulting that they can even think this piece of meh can even compete with that masterpiece.  Besides all that I did play the first game and I got to the third chapter and gave up due to boredom. In fact I enjoyed the first game a lot more than i did this one, it seemed to have more charm i'm not sure exactly why.  Now I did only get to the start of chapter 2 here so take my review with a grain of salt and understand that this is all based of the first third of the game. So anyways the pros:   I do have to give praise for the amount of voice acting, and having the narrator as well is a welcome and much needed aspect to these types of RPG's, and for the most part it's pretty top notch.   The atmosphere is well done and does a good job of immersing me into the world and enviroments.   I do love the amount of options this game gives you to get through any given situation and how it rewards you for being inquisitive and trying things you normally wouldn't in most games and I think that is admirable, and Kudos to the devs for putting in the effort. More RPG's need this kind of depth in their mechanics.   Cons: I am at odds with the plot of DOS 2 as it is pretty simple, but well told. However it is just not interesting, and I find myself just zoning out when the story parts are playing. Maybe it gets better later I don't really know but judging from the first game I doubt it. The whole game feels overdesigned and not in a good way, the weapons the armor the spell effects are so flashy that it ends up just looking stupid and over the top. So I find that it kills my immersion as usually I prefer more grounded and gritty styles. I will admit that this just a preference thing and is subjective but I just feel that it is flashy for flasy's sake. Again nothing like BG The graphics and art style are nice but most of the environments are bland and not very interesting to look at or explore. Music is hit an miss but mostly not very memorable  The combat is also one of the biggest issues for me. Now I don't normally like turn based combat so again this is subjective, so If you do like turn based combat then you will probably like this. I can tolerate turn based combat if the rest of the game is good enough for me to keep me engaged and I have played other turnbased RPG's and enjoyed them so don't get the wrong impression here, it's just that the combat here feels like filler to turn a 10 hour game into a 100 hour game and to me this is just terrible design over all. Now I love my RPG combat but this is all you will be doing for %95 of the game and it gets old fast. My biggest issue with the combat is that enemies have so much HP and they are just bullet sponges for lack of a better term. so every combat encounter takes for ever and it's just exorsting and not fun, which is a shame because i think this game has one of the best Tun Based systems I have ever played. Also nothing like Baldurs Gates RTWP system. In most RPG's if the characters are good I can forgive a middling story but unfortunatley the characters here are not intersting at all, except for the red prince who I did find intrigueing but it wasn't enough to carry mr through this drudgery. They are reasonably fleshed out with back storyes and personal agendas which is nice but again it just falls flat and they feel devoid of any personallity.    The trading and bartering system is a chore, simple things like this should not take so long and require so much effort just to buy and sell, jesus! Now I get that this game does not hold your hand and I appreciate that but crist a little bit of guidance here and there would be nice and go along way in making this game more enjoyable. Most of the time knowing what to do and where to go is half the frustration I have with DOS 2 and the journal is just walls of text with no helpful information at all. You can easily miss key information about quests during dialogue if you are not payng attention which is easy to do if your constantly zoning out due to bordem like I was, but at least give people an option to turn on decent quest hints to help those who may not care about reading walls of text. And some people don't have a good enough memory to remember small little details that they came across 2 hours ago in amongst 20 pages of dialogue for 10 different quests. Options are alwsys a plus.   Overall this game just feels like a cumbersome, frustrating, monotonous time sink that wants to waste my time, the game has a nice charm and good atmosphere to suck me in but all of it's mechanics and systems just infuriate me and psuh me away which is a damn shame because I really wanted to like this series and I did have enjoyable moments with it but they are just drowned out by all the bad.  Oh and yeah and in case you didn't get it it's nothing like Baldurs Gate.  "

Rassy,162,8,4,June 24,Not Recommended,176.4,"Divinity is a fantastic game, but I can't give it a positive rating after the♥♥♥♥♥♥hand I was dealt in the final section of the campaign...    The ending was completely rubbish in a multiplayer situation    The game was amazing right through, I played it through with one of my mates and we went straight through the entirety of Arx with no issues.  Only main issue I can see with the game is that many puzzles and sections of the gameplay felt as though they weren't fluid and extremely unintuitive. Many sections required me to browse the wiki pages as I spent ages puzzling over them and couldn't figure it out at all.   ALONG WITH THIS    The journel was pretty unhelpful and didnt tell us how to complete issues. I'm not asking to be handed puzzle answers but having nothing to go on makes the whole situation drawn out and irritating to complete   Rescuing Arhu was a piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥mission, he spawned in extremely weakened and then was focused by Kemm and immediately killed, saving him was a nearly unatainable achievement.   Now...with my nitpicking aside...for the finale.   The ending obviously results in one of you ascending to divinity, however for multiplayer at least the ending is disappointing, not everyone is a loner who plays with 3 bots for a 100 hour campaign -_-  We spent forever fighting Braccus Rex and then we were treated to a tasty 1v1 where who ever got the first turn won. My friend won the fight due to turn based inconsitency and ascended.   As the loser, you are stuck on the sidelines. I didn't even get to watch the ♥♥♥♥ing cutscene for ascension, I was just teleported to the lady vengeance and expected to twiddle my thumbs while the other gets to watch. It sounds nitpicky but when you have spent ages working through a long♥♥♥♥♥campaign you need payoff of some sort. I got nothing, no cutscene or anything.   The entire game rested on a fight that lasted 10 seconds and went to whoever got the first turn. That is stupid and I cant accept how brief it was.   Its a fantastic game but for multiplayer there are changes that need to be made to the final fight. It was a serious buzzkill."
Erbs,90,8,1,"September 24, 2017",Not Recommended,84.0,"This is the first time i have felt the need to write a review of a game due to the total mis-infomation out there.     There are many reviews of this game saying that this is the best thing since sliced bread or ""Game of the year 2017""....  Do NOT believe a word of it, this game is far from it. That's not to say that at the heart of it this is not a great game, but this game is not a finished product.    Let me do my best to expain what is wrong with a few examples, I will do my best not to give any spoilers...  First is that many reviewers are comparing this game to the likes of DA:Origins, which was one of the reasons I purchased it myself, well it's not even close...  A game from 2009 has this game licked in every possible way apart from the graphics are slightly better in this but a modded version of DA:orgins sorts that too.  Right from the get go this game gives you no info or any real expalanation to anything from character creation to 10 hours into the game.   The fact it has no hand holding by itself is not a problem and to many RPG fans including myself this didnt seem like a hurdle, i've been playing games for nearly 30 years I was sure i could work it all out. Well im about 15+ hours into the game (Steam seems to say less but meh...) and ive realised my Team/Group and my lead hero are just total failure.   See once you play the game for a while you suddenly realise that the combat in the game, although feels tatically correct, if your team is not full of ranged classes then you will get wiped out for the most part. The problem is with the way combat works in general, as in enviromental elements are so massively more important than what class you play or what you do with it.  E.g you can have a rogue with everything going for it but it will hit like a wet noodle and constantly die.  Now compare that to a ranged Mage/Ranger that can fire a fire spell to light up the enviroment and just kill everything including ""your"" Melle :) This then brings you squarely to the next issue and that is the AI that you will be fighting.... It's good..... Great you say... Well yes but every single mob from a simple beast to a named Elite runs with that great AI so you feel like your fighting the same mob with a differnet skin.   Now couple that with the fact that every mob from a dumb thug to a Top notch wizard is given loads of abilities... SO everyone and their mother can teleport/stun/cripple etc etc What this means is you will find yourself in just about every fight dealing with stupid amounts of CC and fire and eviromental effects everywhere melting your team.  Thus why i mentioned earlier that you will want to start using only ranged and cheese fights which makes you feel cheap. All this then means that for the most part you may lose one or two of your team so you will want to res those people... Well thats not that easy, unlike many other games where once combat has ended and you have won your fallen comrads will dust themselves off and you can heal up and move on......    Not here, you will need to use a Scroll of Resurection on each of your dead team mates which are very expensive and rare.   What this means is even if you manage to get through those tough combat areas you are still going to have to re-load a previous save because you lost someone to some cheap mechanic. Now i do appreciate there are going to be people reading this and thinking ...Wow this sounds great and i like difficult games..... This game is NOT difficult it is Frustrating ....those are two different things.   I have been playing this game on ""Normal"" and the difficulty is bang on, if i want it more difficult there are 2 higher difficulty settings.   However banging your head against a brick wall due to bad design/cheap mechanics/bugs is just pure frustrating.  Talking of bugs and other annoyances.... and there are plenty, way too many for me to list. Some are just niggles but some are just a royal pain.   These go from bugs while in combat of spells not firing off and instead your character walks off into fire or does something else unwanted.  All the way to serious bugs in quests not completing having to walk away and back again multiple times until the game triggers something, NPC's not responding to completed quests until you re-load or click on them multiple times. This actuall brings me to another problem which is dialogue in the game, it is handled on a ""Per"" character system so you can actually talk to the same NPC with all your team members, in theory this i a nice touch e.g NPC X won't talk to me because im Human but will talk to my Lizard friend.  The problem is like most things in this game which are good in ""theory"" the execution is poor and what you are left with is a conversation which you end up repeating 4 times just to see if anything is different.  This again would not be a problem if it felt right but what usually happens is you just have to repeat all the same conversation choices you just did not knowing if the NPC will register your first characters conversation or the last. Once again this brings me nicely on to my next complaint.... Dialogue choices ... theres loads and they all feel great when your clicking on them until you realise for the most part it doesnt make any difference and there is only one outcome to the convesation then that is whats going to happen...period.  There are multiple smaller problems like UI is poor, Inventory is badly handled and quest/journal tracking is bad at best, none of which by themselves is that bad but once you start grouping all this with many of its other bad parts you end up with a mess of a game.  Now please believe me when I say I write all this with a heavy heart because the game makes you ""Want"" to love it and you will try everything to like it but there comes a point when there is just too much wrong. The annoying part is if the Devs took this game and spent a couple of weeks ironing out the problems, removing some of the poor combat elements and fixed bugs etc then this game could be something special.... the potential is there.... just not now and for the price tag of £30 .... hell NO.  However i do believe that maybe in 6 months time im sure the modding community will have this game where it needs to be and i can come back here and change my review.....  I hope..... "

On several occasions I have saved the game (I save often due to the difficulty of even Classic mode as well as my impending comment) and when I go to load the game because of a party wipe or NPC's die in combat that I'm trying to keep alive for quest purposes, the game crashes on trying to load that specific save file. Due to the nature of the autosave frequency, it could set you back quite a ways in the game by having to go back to a stable save.  As I said this has happened about a dozen times in the 50 hours I have lovingly poured into this game.

This is the first title that I didn't enjoy and didn't even finish. Why?  - The story and the characters are dull and too serious. It's lost it's sense of humor, making it just another fantasy RPG.  - It's too easy, even on the hardest difficulty.  - The elements are unbalanced. Water + aero is way way way more powerfull then fire + earth/poison. And physical damage is even more OP. A ""jack-of-all-traits-master-of-none""team just doesn't work here. This takes away variety in combat, making every fight feel exactly the same as the previous one. - Inventory management is a pain. - Lizards don't fit in as humanoid characters. I enjoyed playing undead though! - [FIXED] The final act is just plain boring. I couldn't finish it. Fortunately they're redoing the whole act in the DE.  - No Bellegar!!!!  (apart from a small reference on the starter island) and where are Zandalor, ZixZax and others? Only a companion from the previous game makes an appearance, but he's not very iconic to the series.   I wouldn't recommend this version of the game, but I have high hopes for the DE. I'll give that one another go and hopefully I'll find the immersion I'm looking for. :)  EDIT: Unfortunately DE didn't deliver what I had hoped to get from it. Technically they didn't fix any of the things that bothered me for pc and the combat is still imbalanced. I did start a new playthrough in DE, but didn't make it past half of Act 2. This means I haven't experienced the revamped final act, so I can't review that. One positive: they did make the story a lot smoother and they added a handy tutorial."

The world is interesting, graphics are good, sound assets are fine and the music is fine in most places.  I'm enjoying playing the game though there are some things that are making me grit my teeth and groan in frustration:  1. Targeting bug:  Quite often I find I can't target an enemy until I rotate the camera to a certain angle.  This often makes me move when I don't want to, and completing throwing a fight.  2.  The Ai cheats a LOT.  Being able to see through walls with attacks, ignoring elevation rules for LOS, and pixel perfect target selection that is not possible for players to do.  3.  Unfair rights.  My gear is the best I can get (the game is painfully stingy with loot considering the price of items,) and I find some fights utterly unfair even though the enemies are the same level I am.  Some creatures are excessively difficult for their level and the numbers they appear in.  Regularly I'm finding fights end with my main character being the only one alive because attacks do 200-300 in one hit oneshotting half my party and stun locking them.  Often this happens during the surprise round when my party is clumped together, or when  *sigh* SURPRISE re-enforcements arrive.  It is tiresome and unfun.  4. Scaling seems out of wack.  The higher my level the weaker I seem to be.  Enemies become tougher, stronger, faster, etc while the party progresses in a much slower rate, and are often underlevelled for encounters.   The game is almost great, but it desperately needs some balance tweaking to keep me playing for much longer."

A major NPC dies and another fight will be much more difficult, unless you cheese the HELL out of it. We did, and it worked, but it took about an hour of trial and error with constant quicksaves. Also your ship (functioning as your hub) crashes. Yo do not choose the rude dialog option when talking to that same NPC when she dies? Well, you do not get a certain waypoint that is supposed to serve as your hub then after the ship crash (in case it happened). This prevents you from completing some quests, take along an important item, you can no longer respec etc. Mostly one notices that 10 hours into the Act, so loading to back then would be a huge waste of time and effort. I sincerely hope this is a bug, because if it is intentional, someone deserves some major buttkicking. Several bugs prevent sidequests from being completable.  Also, while I am not the biggest expert on Divinity lore, as far as my knowledge goes, this game ♥♥♥♥♥ all over the previously established lore. Example? Lucian, who could not kill the child Damian, suddenly transformed into an ""the end justifies the means, be it genocide and turning people into soulless husks"" kind of person.

Although, to be fair, D:OS 2 really gives its best to be as grimdark as it can, with noone being recognisably good, everyone apparently being evil or at best neutral, people praying in pools of blood, pilgrims killing themselves in a certain trial and so on.  If it would not be for the aforementioned things, it would be a great game, seriously. But those really make it a chore at some points."
solafurn,19,2,0,May 31,Not Recommended,21.4,"I love RPGs, fantasy, and character customization which are a few reasons I got the game... however the character customization isn't very good and has very limited options. Honestly I haven't gotten far in the game. At all. I find the gameplay confusing to be honest, which many people may disagree with but I personally have a really difficult time with it. I find the panning of the camera with the right and left shift keys very annoying and frustrating. The panning of the camera makes the game feel awkward and less fluid, and I have never really been a fan of the downward gaze of a game. I don't find it appealing, it makes me feel less involved.  I have attempted to give this game a shot many times, I've even tried the gameplay with a controler which helped to a degree... but I found it inconvenient. I really really really wanted to love the game, mainly because of how much it costs. However I found those things very unappealing which made it extraordinarily hard for me to get into the game. I'm still trying to get myself into it honestly, and yet I have only gotten off the ship and to the first area. I was too distracted by those things to feel emersed in the game.

The world is interesting, graphics are good, sound assets are fine and the music is fine in most places.  I'm enjoying playing the game though there are some things that are making me grit my teeth and groan in frustration:  1. Targeting bug:  Quite often I find I can't target an enemy until I rotate the camera to a certain angle.  This often makes me move when I don't want to, and completing throwing a fight.  2.  The Ai cheats a LOT.  Being able to see through walls with attacks, ignoring elevation rules for LOS, and pixel perfect target selection that is not possible for players to do.  3.  Unfair rights.  My gear is the best I can get (the game is painfully stingy with loot considering the price of items,) and I find some fights utterly unfair even though the enemies are the same level I am.  Some creatures are excessively difficult for their level and the numbers they appear in.  Regularly I'm finding fights end with my main character being the only one alive because attacks do 200-300 in one hit oneshotting half my party and stun locking them.  Often this happens during the surprise round when my party is clumped together, or when  *sigh* SURPRISE re-enforcements arrive.  It is tiresome and unfun.  4. Scaling seems out of wack.  The higher my level the weaker I seem to be.  Enemies become tougher, stronger, faster, etc while the party progresses in a much slower rate, and are often underlevelled for encounters.   The game is almost great, but it desperately needs some balance tweaking to keep me playing for much longer."
Za,332,2,0,"November 29, 2017",Not Recommended,5.9,"This is more of a first impression review as I've not even finished the starting area but so far I'm not very impressed with how the game actually plays. I enjoy the story fine and the voice acting is wonderful though. But having just finished DOS 1 I'm very unhappy with the direction DOS 2 took in many ways.   As  a huge fan of the original DOS I find it bizarre how much the mechanics have changed. Combat isn't everything in this style of game but the changesa are so jarring I'm not sure I care to continue right now, and even if DOS 2 was the first I tried the combat system is just not much to my liking.  My biggest complaint is the weird Physical Armor and Magical Armor split. Unlike DOS 1 armor doesn't provide a flat % damage reduction and instead In DOS 2 everything has 3 Health bars, but before you can start chipping into the actual hit points of a target you have to eat through either Phyiscal or Magical armor with their respective damage types. This means having a split party of Mages and Fighters is really ineffecient as you'll be pushing through all three health pools instead of just two, doable yes, but way worse than just running 2 characters with the right skills and talents who focus on the same type of damage. There is no reward for party variety and in fact punishment for it.   Further the mechanics of both types of armor are even more of a hassle by blocking all status effects from taking effect until the armor pool broken. For example you can't stun someone with a shock spell until magical armor is depleted.  This includes, for some maddening reason, preventing any enemy who has an armor rating from being Taunted. So tanking isn't really much use. Speaking of tanking being not very useful, each enemy in the game will auto target your weaknesses and more often than not focus fire the lowest HP member of your party. You can actually learn to use this to your advantage but really it's just frustrating.   Also for vets of the first DOS the system has totally redone action points into a flat 4 per turn 6 points max, with only a few talents and spells modifying this at all. Not exactly a horrible change honestly but it doesn't feel ""right"" coming from the first game.   Honestly I'm going to take a break and play some other games and try to come back to DOS 2 with a more fresh perspective, but I'm still giving this a thumbs down for my own personal issues witht the combat system."

DevilFish,77,10,1,"September 30, 2017",Not Recommended,178.2,"Lots of people are talking about pros so I'ma share some cons.  This game will waste your time away, and by waste I mean WASTE. For starters you have to be save scum to the max. There are elements in the game that are insta-kill, and it will destroy you as simply as opening an unmarked door. Some battles will made you replay over and over and over and over again. Also if you don't invest in teleportation, you'll literally be dropped in a fiery pit with no means of getting out. Who knew? Or perhaps you'll enter a new area, be locked in a dialogue with no hope talking your way out, then being pulled into a fight and wiped out in the first turn (of course the enemy goes first...).   Long battles. Some people love the strategy in them. But as deep as the mechanics go, it gets pretty stale by your 100th tangle. What also gets stale is how long it takes for moves and attacks to animate out. If there are 10+ characters and an uneasy terrain, a fight can take well over 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and if you lose you'll have to redo it! (Unless you saved -midbattle).  Levelling system means in order to stay well equiped for adventure you'll need to spend about HALF OF YOUR TIME managing your inventory and buying/selling with merchants. You grow no attachment to your items, there is not a smug of aesthetic customization as most items both look the same and you can't see them until you put them on. Plus this isn't Skyrim so you can't just loot whatever exists in the game. Its more old school and loot is either randomly generated or placed.  A lack of seriousness. Sure there's a bounty of comedy in the game. But as far as I can tell you don't really get attached to any characters or their interests along the way. Sure there isn't a forceful light or dark path for you to take, rather its usually a I-Don't-Even-Care kind of path you end up on.  Level design is nothing new. Dragon Age has more memorable places and more interesting map corners.  Psychic enemies knowing your weaknesses. You'll literally need a mod in the workshop to make it a little more realistic and not computerized. Also you'll begin to realize that some battles have pre-programed movesets for the enemies, such as a marksman immediately teleporting to some far-reaching platform right away. This both makes fights really repetitive and also very procedural. PROCEDURAL.  Quests that don't Close. There's about a dozen or so quests that just won't Close properly. If you have OCD this game might just kill you. Plus the instructions are stylishly like a journal - in other words - often do not provide direct instructions. Think this makes it more immersive? NOT WHEN YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOUR CHARACTER EVEN MEANS IN HIS/HER OWN JOURNAL.  Soul-less characters. Revenge is a common option in the game. Most of the time its meaningless if the characters are described to be stoic and unhinged til oblivion.  90% of enemies know magic. 90% of enemies have ranged attacks. Even 'swordsman'. FYI.  Hotkeys that shift around even after you 'locked' them.  Confusing exterior-transitions. Usually to enter a building you have to click move into a space that isn't revealed yet (until you enter). How many times have I accidently 'stole' something as I'm trying to enter a building....  If you can overlook these gripes (and some others), then I'll recommend this game..."
irrelevant_elephant,94,3,1,February 7,Not Recommended,160.5,"If wondering why I spent so much time and still gave a thumbs down it's because I enjoyed it at first, but during Act 2 things went downhill. I would have quit except I had invested 120 hours at that point and I was still interested in the story.     PROS  + Presentation  The graphics are high quality for an isometric RPG with settings such as DOF, god-rays, shadowing, and other effects. Environments are stuffed full of assets, giving your eyes plenty to take in. Armors are probably the best I have ever seen containing lots of details and some especially foreign fashions. The soundtrack is an unusual combination of typical orchestra mixed in with exotic instruments; the result is a unique listening experience. The dialogue is entirely voice-acted making for a welcome addition. I did, however, noticed some inconsistency in the recording. Occasionally while talking to someone, it would suddenly sound like the actor/actress was too far away from the mic which was a bit jarring to hear. For the most part, the voice acting is excellent. Overall DOS 2 has a unique style and feels like a triple 'A' experience.   + Story  The premise is intriguing enough: Rivillon is in danger of being invaded, and the only hope is for someone to become the new Divine. You have the potential to achieve divinity, but so do your companions, and only one of you can ascend to godhood. If you decide to play as a premade character, then you'll have your own background story to play through. The main plot has some surprises which entice you to go on, and near the end, there are some crazy plot twists.   CONS  - Inconsistent Difficulty  The difficulty in this game varies way too much. Estimating how hard enemies are before a battle is less predictable than you would think. Factors such as quantity of enemies, what skills they have, and terrain significantly influence the outcome. I've had battles where I should have lost due to being out-leveled and out-numbered and yet still come out alive. On the other hand, I had enemies I couldn't defeat despite being a higher level and outnumbering them.   - Fragmented Exploration and Questing   When it comes to exploring and doing quests, you'll often get interrupted by difficulty spikes forcing you to leave and return once you've leveled up. Now, this is fine in moderation; many other games do this enforcing a sense of progression. The problem with DOS 2 is this sort of thing occurs persistently. It's frustrating to frequently start a quest, progress some ways into it, and then put it on hold while you grind other quests. These other quests also require you to stop part ways in and come back to later. The result is that you are always bouncing back and forth chipping away at things so that you can progress a little further.   It's like watching a marathon of movies, but instead of doing so in sequence, you do it in a scattered manner. Eventually, you will finish watching everything, but because there are constant interruptions, it's hard to get engaged with any one movie. In your attempt to complete what you have already started, the game thrusts several more quests for you to chip away. At one point, I had about twenty in my log. Having lots of quests to do is good, just not all at once; it gets overwhelming. It's not possible to avoid this from happening either because to progress you need to explore thoroughly, but in doing so, you unintentionally trigger more quests thus overloading your log.   A way to streamline gameplay is to decrease the difficulty, but unfortunately, this makes specific encounters underwhelmingly easy. So you can either have a fragmented adventure or have a cake walk. This quandary is all thanks to the wild variation in difficulty which I mentioned earlier.   Another thing which bothers me is the inability to go back to previous acts. I had a dilemma where I was getting tired of the Driftwood map and wanted to move on but still had unfinished quests. If the devs had allowed a return to areas, then I would have carried on with the game and come back after feeling more refreshed. Instead, I had to make an unnecessary choice between forcing myself to finish those quests there and then, or move on but forever lose the opportunity to do them.  - Flawed Combat  Initially, I enjoyed combat despite its short-comings, but as time went on, certain flaws grew more irritating. Combat lacks what I consider to be bare-bone essentials of turn-based gameplay. For starters, there is no cover mechanic which means melee characters will be out in the open exposed to ranged attacks. Also, you can't set overwatch (attack of opportunity) by yourself; it's automatic. Characters don't even get it by default; you have to earn the talent for it.   Another thing that hurts combat is the initiation system. In games like XCOM, turns get divided by teams. During your party's turn, you can use members in any order you'd like. You can also partially use a character's action points and then after issuing commands for other members, come back to use up the rest. Part of the fun and strategy of this setup is deciding what sequence of actions is optimal. In this game, however, there is no such thing; turns get divided amongst individuals. Who gets to act when during a round is determined by the initiation; the higher it is the sooner your members get to go. Performing sooner than an enemy is obviously beneficial since you can apply status effects (ex. stunned) or even kill before it gets the chance to act. That being said, having one of your members perform before another is not necessarily a good thing; here's an example.   There is a mage who is just about dead, and it's your turn. The character you are using at the moment is a melee build and doesn't have enough action points to reach and finish off the mage. You do however have an archer who could finish the job, except you have to wait until his turn. It just so happens that the mage gets to go before the archer and uses healing thus avoiding death. As a result of this, the battle goes on longer than it should have and in the end, you end up defeated. Perhaps this example is extreme, but it gets my point across; it's a rigid system which prevents you from using your members in a logical and strategic order. It's possible to delay a member's turn, but this isn't very helpful since you can't use it once any points get spent. Also, it puts that member at the very end of the round instead of swapping places with another team-mate. To summarize, the initiation system is inflexible and anti-strategy which goes against the whole idea of turn-based combat.   CONCLUSION  Despite people praising this game for its flexibility, it's ironically rigid which made me feel like I wasn't able to play the way I wanted to. I wish I my final impressions were better, but there were too many flaws. Ultimately, I give Divinity: Original Sin 2 a PAR of 1.  IMPORTANT: I use PARS instead of a standard 1-10 scale.

Cassette,445,3,1,"October 8, 2017",Not Recommended,53.1,"I wish I could give the game a Maybe or Mixed rating. It's not a bad game per se, there's a lot to be enjoyed here: deep RPG mechanics, lots of roleplay, decent story and characters...  But the fun stops with the combat, while the core elements of it are very fun with all the tactics and elemetal madness going on, most of the time it just feels cheap, unfair, unbalaced and so on and on and on. Enemies always come in overwhelming numbers, with too much health and armor, they also happen to be omniscient and know all your weak spots, have more Action Points and sometimes they even ignore initiative/round order among others.  The difficulty is all over the place, in Classic mode (Normal difficulty) a single enemy a level above you can cause very serious damage to your party if you're not careful, if they're a single level below, it's a cakewalk. But if you do lower the difficulty to Explorer mode (Easy difficulty), then there's no challenge, it's so patronizingly easy that there's no fun. There's a real problem with stats bloat here.  The armor system is just stupid, all it does is add a second health bar that completely negates damage and status effects until depleted, afterwards it's useless, you can restore it, but it'll go down again soon enough. I really don't understand why they decided to make it this way.  And somehow I always felt underleveled to most situations even after completing all the quests I could get and trying not to stray away from the path too much, it just felt very unbalaced by the end of it all. And while I'm completely against it, you can't even grind levels in this game.   I can see people enjoying the combat, but to me it just didn't felt right, I didn't felt the diffilculty was because of my (lack of) skill, but because of bad design. I've played lots of CRPGs, including Original Sin 1, but this is the first time I ran into something like this. It's a shame, because I'm really enjoying my time with the game, just not the combat, the polar opposite of the first game, where I really loved the combat but not much the rest.  There's other little quirks with the game, but I don't think it's worth mentioning since the worst aspects are already here.  I would recommend the game if you have the patience to deal with the crazy difficulty or if you just don't care at all and don't mind playing a very, very stupidly easy RPG while on Explorer mode. But if you're like me, and don't like the concept of tying the difficulty to levels and stats or just didn't like the idea of anything written here, then there's better CRPGs out there for the likes of us."
Shroom,361,3,0,"October 22, 2017",Not Recommended,60.7,"I would give this game 3 stars on a scale of 1 to 5.  The good: The game itself is pretty fun. If you have read anything about it you will know that it's a solid old school RPG that is relatively unforgiving and certainly not noob friendly. That is part of why it's a good game. You don't get quest markers saying ""go here next"" or tons of help with how to build or equip your characters. You simply need to figure it out. That is a large part of what makes it a good game. There are literally tons and tons of successful ways to play the game (and almost as many ways to nerf yourself) which is a large part of the fun.   The game itself is great. The game is totally voice acted which makes for a nice touch in the modern age of voice-overed RPGs. The combat is very strategic and makes you think (unless you're on super easy mode). The quests are not gimmes and you need to think through what you're doing AND the sequence you do quests in. There are lots of ways to play the game which is probably the best thing about divinity 2 overall.  The bad: Bugs. Bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs bugs and did i mention bugs? There are several essentially game breaking bugs that will♥♥♥♥♥♥you off to no end.  The first annoying bug is the ""half my team goes into combat bug"". You waltz into an area and bang, a fight starts. You take a quick glance at the top of your screen to see in which sequence you will get to take actions only to realize that 2 or sometimes even 3 of your 4 characters are not even involved. wtf? They're literally standing RIGHT NEXT to the character that is in combat and yet they're not considered active participants. Basically you have to load at your last save (which by the way, is the biggest advice for divinity 2, save often plus more often).  The other frustrating bug is that if you're playing on steam (who isn't?) you will get a launch error 1 out of 3 times. Basically you will get an error code that says the game executable file is corrupted in some way and you can't play. You can try verifying the integrity of the game cache and it works sometimes. Other times you simply have to delete everything and reinstall. Remember to go into your steam library files and set the game to launch in compatibility mode as an admin and this may reduce your errors to 1 in 4 launched. Nothing i have done however seems to get rid of this error.   Basically Larian made a great game but didn't take the time to fix some seriously game breaking errors. The game itself is fantastic but unfortunately it has a few massive gameplay faults in addition to some monstrous stability issues. I would wait another 3 - 6 months before picking this game up.

Enemies that are ridiculously strong even on normal. Being forced to go down to the easiest difficulty due to  running out of ways to resurrect your party members is not a fun game mechanic.  A UI and map that are utterly useless, quests aren't marked on the map at all. I can understand that in a game where you are encouraged to figure things out for yourself, but you simply can't when the quest logs are bugged themselves. There's also no way to seperate 'junk' items automatically, having to manually click dozens of items to sell them isn't fun.   I really want to enjoy this game but I can't with these issues (the broken quests are by far the most annoying, one example being me being forced into a loop where I had to return to a character who had died, making the quest impossible to complete).

I first started out by looking at FAQ about the technical issues I was encountering. When I tried the answers found there and they didn't work I continued by emailing technical support for the game, spending at least 2 more days going back and forth trying several things to no avail. I have come to the point of extreme exhaustion and annoyance, I am done trying to get this game to work. I'm not totally stupid with computers, I'm capable of following directions and doing things that need to be done but I shouldn't HAVE to do it in the first place. This whole process was so NON user friendly, to have to have your customers do this file rearranging, downloading, verifying, and god knows what else JUST to get a game to simply play right for the first time.. It has been extremely time consuming and I am furious I wasted so much time trying to get this game to work.

c_bus87,17,6,1,September 10,Not Recommended,57.0,"I might be one of the few who genuinely does not like this game. Here's why:  1) I feel like there are 'gotcha' moments in dialogue. Someone asks a question and you are given a few responses. One of them progresses the quest, the other two end it because the person gets mad at you or something. There is no way of knowing which one is correct (by investigation, getting to know the person, etc.) or by coming back later. I can hear the devs going ""Haha you picked the wrong answer!!!"" Not clever, just irritatig.   ""Hey, do you like a, b, or c?""  ""I like a.""  ""You idiot! Now I don't like you forever!!"" -- a regular conversation, apparently.  2) An over-reliance on terrain types in combat. Terrain types should be an accent to a strong combat system, but this feels like boring fighting on changing terrains. It makes combat feel like a weird board game a opposed to a real tactical experience. I would rather see an emphasis on flanking, cover, team work, and skills. There are many battles that simply cannot be won without manipulating terrain type.  3) The game lacks immersion. I'm not sure I ever cared about the quest or main mission. The world doesn't feel lived in. There are to many jokes that rip you from the seriousness of the situation. The tone is chicken jokes, not end of the world or serious danger. Additionally, once an area is clear its clear for good.  If I remove a gang in the prison, is it likely that no one will fill the power vacuum? No more prisoners will come in? The world feels empty and unresponsive.  4) Growth happens slowly at first, but then very rapidly. I don't feel like I've earned a lot of my attribute points. The way areas are leveled also makes the game feel very linear, and, again, once an area is clear it's typically clear for good. No random encounters, which might make leveling up to face a tough enemy more rewarding.  "
lowenklee,41,6,1,August 16,Not Recommended,109.6,"As a quick matter of background info, these days I generally enjoy more action type RPGs, but I’m no stranger to the old school CRPG genre. That said, and as regards the D:OS series …   I didn't enjoy the first game's story, world space/mythos, or light-hearted touch ...but the combat mechanics were rock-solid and highly compelling. On the recommendation that the narrative and thematic elements had been improved while maintaining the original's strong combat mechanics I decided to give the sequel a go.  At about 50 hours invested, it's awful and surprisingly dull:  ~Mediocre and generic storytelling (admittedly better than most games but certainly nothing to get excited over).  ~Combat encounters all feel the same (i.e. jarringly arbitrary and ridiculous ...that everything reduces to fire and teleporting regardless of enemy type is only slight hyperbole).  ~The new armor system adds nothing but tedium.  ~There's a quest tracker that may as well have been completely omitted (not asking for hand-holding or map markers, but how about at least capturing the salient details after receiving hints/tips in dialogue on a consistent basis?)   ~And finally there's the unforgivably antiquated UI/Inventory truly worthy of nothing but scorn.  Much has been made of the game's difficulty, but difficulty is manageable (simply turn it down, prepare better, or learn better tactics); what isn't manageable are bad game mechanics, even when presented in a pretty wrapper.   Perhaps the GM mode and the co-op are the game's redeeming features. If so, fair enough. But, for my money as a single-player gamer, the game can certainly be fun with some considerable effort invested ignoring its shortcomings. But is it worth the trouble? Not particularly.   Personal recommendation? ...buy it on sale. Caveat Emptor. "

I LOVE THE FIRST GAME AND I LOVE THIS GAMES WORLD. but honestly this game just feels like its punishing you for playing it. unless you want to take in every detail and take 10 minues deciding every move the first game is much much better. easy is like dumb as hell. and classic is a grulling struggle to stay alive. honestly yuou hit level 10 and the game just stops being fun. basically play a team that does one dmg type either physical or magical or struggle almost every big fight.  as a big fan of this game, i find it super annoying to se such an amazing expirence lose its self trying to be this hard game. if you can make an actually hard game do it, but making a game with bloated enemy stats late game and encounters literally designed to kill you until you figure out the ""gimmick"" (i dont use that word lightly) to win. this results in a rinse and repeat strats that kill any immersion the steller setting this game gives you. for a game that lets you do anything in many senerios, the fact that leveling kills your exploration, and guides you through thte game in a basically linear path is pretty sad and goes to show the developers had ""this need to be hard because ppl like the hard stuff"" in mind which goes so against how the rest of the game feels.  like i play games when im high and trying to relax, i like a challange, not getting but ♥♥♥♥ed for making the wrong action selection because i didnt pay attention to the five minutes it was the enemies turn....... for anyone whos played  it the oil to fire voidling fight is  a  good example of my point. unless you know whats going to happen in that fight you will die even on easy mod.  thats not fun, thats lame game design."
Jaku,145,1,2,"November 24, 2017",Not Recommended,369.0,"This game will ruin you. Not in the sense that you won't enjoy it. In that you will most likely enjoy it too much. That's one main reason why i wouldn't in my right mind reccomend it. For i fear you will also lose a fair amount of your week to week life from this game also.   However my sole reason for writting this review in the first place. Is that due to some unforeseen error. (that i can only assume is either divine intervention or just the worst luck possible) Your camera can lock perminantly into darkness. Note this is only if you having a super fun time with your perma-death difficulty enabled characters in split-screen mode. (it's rumoured to be whenever your playing split screen mode you run a risk of this, it has only happened twice so far to be fair however the entirety of your save file is thereforth unplayable).   So as I was saying(ranting, excuse the emotional nature of my review, me and my freind have just lost all progress of a finely tuned epic playthrough due to an error we can't fix no matter what we've tried.) So to contuine forth in our playing of the game would be to admit we don't care for the 40+ hours that it has taken us to get to this point.   You will most likely enjoy this game if you have ever played a turn based game prior or enjoy Dungeons and Dragons. However let me reiterate the reason I am not reccomending it, is due to the sheer heart break that may be fall you if you happen to become prey to the same bug.   (which I'm more than 100% certain is simply the camera deciding it wants to go subteranian and never reapear again)  To summerise     -Great Game    -Not worth the time  "
EinherjarsReturn,136,1,0,May 10,Not Recommended,49.7,"On the surface, this is everything you'd want from a game in this genre.  On closer inspection, however, the narrative in the game is highly geared towards one fixed end. The quote-on-quote moral choices you make don't seem impactful at all when this narrative is driven forward no matter what. The dialogue, which is besides the combat the bread and butter of the game, gets extremely preachy and tiresome very quickly. To put it roughly, the game offers you the illusion of a multi-approach binary choice, but then encourages the 1 rather than the 0 in every interaction."

NanoByteGhost,354,7,0,"October 5, 2017",Not Recommended,111.9,"I have now finished this game and have rewriten this review.   I have included some tips to help you finish this game if you really want to buy it. There are some things the game just throws at you suddenly that will end your game if your not prepared.   They labeled this game an RPG when in reality its more of a squad combat game with upgrades. Focus on that and you will understand the game better.    Role Play options are very limited. The game really does not have much support for geninue role play and the support that does exist, really does not do much. It is all about earning experience to upgrade your characters for the next fight.   The characters background stories are weak and uninteresting, the main plot never really grabbed me.   I got the impression the game was designed before the story and they wrote the story to try and encompose all the fights the game designers had created.   There are for example nearly a dozen bad guys, not of which have any explainable link to each other during the game but get thrown together right at the end without any real explanation.   Many players who have finished the game consider the ending to be a disappointment and honestly, if your expecting a good story, your going to find it disappointing too.   Its a squad based combat game, plain and simple.   With that in mind, this is the core gameplay.   You fight, you earn experience points which eventually leads to you leveling up. At that time you get awarded points that can be spent improving your character.   I found it useful not to spend all these points right away due to the games ""One way to do some stuff"" problem.   Each area you explore is filled with bad guys which you have to kill, once dead they do not respawn. The experience you earned killing them is the only experience your going to get from them. So make the most of it.   If you can get 1 level higher than the bad guys your fighting, then the game is much easier, if your equal or even lower in level than the guys your fighting, its very hard.   What characters you choose for your party may appear to be a free choice on your part but its not. That is an illusion because this game needs you to have certain things in your party to stop you either dying a lot or just not being able to process past some quests.   Without a Mage in your party for example every single fight is like a BOSS fight.   Makes are like EASY MODE on Hard difficulty. Explorer difficulty is what most games would call ""Very hard"" difficulty.   With a mage in your party things get slightly easier and you manage to avoid most of the games bad habits.  The developers favourite trick is putting you up against impossible odds that you cannot win without playing the system, eg abusing fast travel to heal, reloading saved games when a spell does not work as intended, so you can try again.   There are no easy fights in this game, in fact most fights are extraordinarily hard.   Especially if you do not have a mage in your party.   AIs at your level typically (not always) have twice as much health, twice as much armour and twice as much magic armour than you. They also seem to have far better spells to cast at you.   Source which is used to power the most powerful spells, just seems to be sucked out of you and used to power the AIs most powerful spells. So having any source on you, is like giving the AI ammo to shoot you with.   So imagine what an insane idea it would be if you had unlimited source for spells.... That would seriously suck when the AI pretty much uses your own source to kill your entire party over and over again.   Thats not rhetorical btw....  Stun, freeze, charm and shock are all spells that cause you to miss a turn, you will spend most of your game watching your characters being slowly killed without you ever getting a turn because of these. A mage helps defend against these but they still happen and are far too common in this game.  It makes fights boring.  Some people consider Teleport to be optional, but there are many locations in this game where you simply cannot proceed without it.  Blood rain or any pool of blood is also needed at one point so if your a solo character without blood rain, you game will end pretty abruptly.  Also developing your characters relationships in game is important because if they are not best buddies, you will lose some of them at a certain point in the game and that party you worked so hard on for 3 acts, will just no longer exist and it happen without fight or any choice on your party.   The game makes the same mistake Divinity 1, Pillars and Wasteland all made, they make every battle very very hard unless you stumble across the right party combination and spell combination, then the game becomes easier.  RPGs of old scaled well with difficulty, this game does not, its 24/7 hard hard hard.    If you want to try something different, you will probably find the game kicks your♥♥♥♥♥ at several points and stops you progressing. Though this game is less prone to that than Divinity 1 was.  Puzzles tend to be vague and badly explained, you really have to second guess the devs intentions a lot in this game. A sign of bad game design.  At certain points you have epic battles with an areas main boss, given most fights feel like boss fights, you can imagine how much harder these guys are.   So imagine reaching a point in the game, worked around all the bugs, learned the system so the game would not just end suddenly on you. Only to find your self facing every frigging bad guy you previously killed later on, not 1 at a time but all at once and this time they are level 20.   That is not rhetorical either....  You will be left with the impression the devs didnt want anybody seeing the end game which tends to reveal the games story is very very adhock nature.   If you still want to buy this game I suggest you take at least 1 mage in your party, this makes the game much easier. I also suggest you take the teleport spell, the blood rain spell and learn to use the Pyramid fast travel and map fast travel to send characters out of combat to heal during the worst fights because you will need that advantage.   You need the learn the system to beat this game, between the insane difficulty and bugs you cannot finish it without knowing how it all works or how to abuse that system.   I am sure their are cheats, god mode or what ever available but I dont know them, so I played the game as is and I can tell you without specialist knowledge, this game will last you about 110 hours first time around.   Finally save often and make it a new save, do not over write other saves because you will find you have to go back quite far some times to work around game bugs or that sudden case of ""cannot progress without something"" problem that this game has.    So, is it a good game ?  It is squad combat is good game but the battles are stupidly hard most of the time, so you end up getting more frustrated with the game than anything.   The original Divinity Original Sin was only finished by 6% of players according to steams stats during its first 2 years. The Directors cut/Enhanced version was slightly easier but still very hard.   Divinity 2 is a lot like that, most of you will never get to the end of it.  I found this game to be more frustrating then fun, it wears you do until you lose all interest in playing it. That is how most of your games will end.   I only finished it because it♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off and I was not going to be beaten by a badly balanced game.  I think the game engine is good, the ideas in the game are good but the gameplay difficulty is stupidly hard with clearly unbalanced features common place.   Especially in combat when an AI mage hits you with 1 spell and destroys your magic armour in one go, then hits you with another spell and just kills you out right.   That happens a lot so take a lot of resurrection scrolls.   I cannot recommend this game unless you love that feeling of frustration."

You are always out numbered at the start and it seems every encounter has atleast one or more npcs which either summon adds, or the game just cheats and throws more adds in as the battle progresses. 2. NPCs played by the same rules as the characters.  an NPC the same level as your character will always have more HP, will always have more Regular Armor and more Magic Armor (these are two seperate things in this game) will always have more skills and more resists and this is at the easiest setting.  Also NPCs can cheat and shoot arrows and cast spells through things that block your attacks. Like wise human like NPCs seem to have infinite special ammo (like fire arrows and poison bombs) and Monstrous NPCs constantly spam their AOE/status altering attacks. 3. Every battle ground is staged against you.  The enemy always has the high ground for ranged attacks, requiring you to navigate 2 or 3 turns to get on even footing and away from the preplaced barrels of fun that get exploded for your enjoyment er uhm death.  All the while your enemies, enjoying all this carefully placed stuff are wearing you down and spamming the entire battle field with fire / ice / poison etc.. 4. Even if you are the kind of person who enjoys reloading and trying the same battle over 10 times or more to figure out how to beat any particular fight, you will still be upset when the game crashes while your doing one of those reloads, or the save you have been reloading over and over again gets corrupted and cant be loaded, Or you finally win the fight only to discover that one of those negative status effects that got applied during the battle, never comes off afterwards, oh and the quest that was supposed to be updated / completed doesnt get updated or completed either.  All that said, there is a real diamond in the rough here.  Graphics are amazing, Music / sound is nice (i havnt been tempted to turn it off yet,) and what little i have been able to see of the quests / roleplaying part of the game has left me wanting more and more (which makes me ever more frustrated with all the above that keeps me from persuing the actual game.)

My craftworks didn't have all of the properties of top drops, but for what I wanted to do, my crafted equipment fit my strategy. Life was good. In D:OS 2, crafting is useless. Why bother stockpiling loot? Crafting is one of the joys of any D&D Style game, and it is sorely missing here.  2 is that combat is boring. D:OS 2 suffers from the same problem as Dragon Age II. The only way to get through toughest tier combat is to play each battle multiple times, memorize the spots where enemies spawn, and position in advance accordingly. Or, watch a video that shows spawn points and positional tactics for that battle. This is a horrible approach to combat. D:OS original had some very tough fights that required real strategy to survive. D:OS 2 requires no strategy, just watch a video for each fight, position as the video does, use the same spells, and the fight becomes almost too easy.   3 is the insane power spike of each level. A level 16 fight is impossible for a level 15 party, and piece of cake for a level 17 party. This makes the game too linear, with little freedom to explore, and the only real way to tell the right order to do things is...watch walkthrough videos! In D:OS original, I rather liked having my lvl 6 party take on lvl 8 char-boned archers. In D:OS 2, this is not possible. Your level provides huge differences in base stats, the stats of any equipment you buy, etc. It's too much.  4 is the lack of any engaging story. D:OS 2's story feels like an afterthought. In D:OS original, there was real character development, truly original twists and turns, and I was left with an inspired fantasy of something that felt like it could have really happened. D:OS original had a Silmarillion-esque quality about it, or the AD&D descriptions of the nine hells and seven heavens. D:OS was interesting reading/watching on its own right, to really contemplate an alternate theory of cosmology and the universe. D:OS 2 tries to copy the same story pattern, but there's nothing really interesting about it. D:OS 2's story ""reads"" like a typical Choose Your Own Adventure book.   So...there you go. I almost feel bad, because a lot of people put a lot of time into this. But most of what made the first game special, is missing in this. Spell combinations is probably the most interesting thing about D:OS 2, and it really is impressive. But for me, that's not enough."

Outside the bugs, that stop the progress of the game, the game itself has many moments in which you find yourself googling every next step as there's no logical conclusion to make.  Some videos for problems you'll find online have 100k+ views so it's just accepted that parts of this game are trial and error without much reasoning.   Going to try to get as far as I can into the game but with the bugs I doubt I make it much further, I'll probably have to kill a few key characters simply because they are bugged out and hope for the best.

Reias,255,3,0,August 26,Not Recommended,133.3,"Backed this game on Kickstarter  Finally beat the game. Played with 3 of my friends, from the beginning, restarted a litany of times in order to play as different characters, and finally beat it today. And wow, was it a bad journey.  Don't get me wrong; The multiplayer aspect was fun. Working with my friends tactically to take down enemies and out manuveur them was insane, but the joy was constantly sucked out by the many choices you could make to ""break"" this game. The freedom of choice is phenomenal and will draw plenty to it, but compared to other CRPGs of the time, the story was broken (quite literally at times, with our group not even finishing Sebille or Fanes backstories; My own, playing the Red Prince, seemed to get stuck at the end though it seemed to be finished), the action was often split and far between long sections of players do whatever they want and exploring, and there was a fair amount of time where I didn't experience the story at all because other players went left when I decided to go right.  Now most of what I mentioned as problems were intended to be features of the game. Carve your own path in a multiplayer in which everyone can participate on different sides of the same story; Do what you want when you want, and solve problems in unique ways. This prospect was the same thing that I loved playing Divinity OS 1 with my brother a while back. And you can find aspects of this game that mirror those exact design goals. But Divinity OS 1 handled this with a voting system that at least made sense, and the chaos of four players with different mind sets often doing what they want, that you could miss out if everyone isn't tied to each other as they advance forward, and the fact you could completely end another person's gaming experience by doing what you want in a quest and ruin what they intended to do ruined this game for me.  This entire review could be taken as the a twisted view on the positives of what this game has to offer, but honestly, I have a hard time imagining a group of friends / gamers playing the game without ruining it by devolving it into a race to see who gets to experience the game first.  If you are looking for a fun tactical romp through the Divinity universe, look no further. If you are looking for a unique multiplayer RPG that takes your choices into consideration and provides a wonderfully in depth RPG system, get ready to fight your friends and watch what little your teamwork means in a game that forces you to fight against each other to decide the end."

To support a game/franchise that you love     A1. The early access community might be the most toxic community I have seen in ANY early access (yep, that includes you Creativerse! AMAZING!). The developers have no interest in actually moderating and things are being tossed around in the forums that would get you perma-baned in other forums, let alone a soft ban... How is it supposed to work? A) Someone posts suggestion B) People agree or disagree civil like, possibly being a simple as +1 or -1. What shouldn't happen? Fan boi's rush into any thread critical of any aspect of the game and proceed to destroy not only the suggestion, but more specifically the person giving the suggestion (AKA Alinsky rules for radicals, ad hominem, ect) People have been reported multiple times and nothing has been done. I will leave below links of threads with this happening if you care to see for yourself. If you want to buy into the early access for this reason run the other way.  http://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/142261352659532710/?ctp=2 http://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/152391285462768446/  Also, another side note would be that Larian does not intend to take ""player feedback"" and change the game based on that in any degree. They have a road map and are doing what they set out to do, nothing more nothing less. If you are buying into the Early Access you are purely playing as a ""bug finder"" in which case Larian should be paying the players, not the other way around...   A2. DOS:EE was one step forward two steps back and three to the side of DOS: Original and DOS2 is following the same path. If you loved DOS you might like DOS:EE and you could possibly even like DOS2- but are the games similiar enough to support purely because of this now? No. The game is changing at a rate that frankly you don't know what you will have at release and supporting the game purely from a franchise view point is beyond risky.   Bottom line is that if you are in group one don't waste your time and money. If you are in group 2 don't take the risk (you can only play act 1 which is only 10-20 hours) and wait until the game is fully released and it is clearer.  EDIT: Once again in another EA game people are reviewing a game based on what they ""hope"" the game will be and not what the game is currently, while ignoring the community and input-giving aspects entirely... Those are literally the only reasons (as I point out above) why you would support a game in Early Access and currently the game is not worth risking an EA buy in- wait until the game comes out and read some reviews at that point in time and make your choice then."

Delimon,407,12,8,October 8,Not Recommended,68.2,"Personally, I want to love this game, I really really do, I wish I could give a mixed opinion (Gabe why can't we do this yet??????) But I can only give a thumbs up and a thumbs down. So with that I guess I can only say that I can only give it based off what the average consumer can expect.  First off this game is linear, in other words, it seems like you can do whatever you want but you actually can't because you need to be a high enough level to do so in the first place forcing you to do quests and tasks in a specific order.  Then there are more issues such as some serious design flaws. The armor system (for example) is one of them. Because of how it works you can't really used a mixed party. You either go all in for physical or all in for magical damage. To make matters worse as long as the enemy has physical armor you can't cc them which is a serious design flaw.  Then it kinda gets a bit worse when we talk about how you have to cheese everything and chain cc to win or how enemies can cc chain you into oblivion. This is why you use a diminishing returns system, ie. the more you use something the less effective it is.  The story is honestly kind of meh but it does have it's ups and downs. Personally I don't have any complaints about it.  Honestly, the game doesn't have that many issues IMO, but the issues are so bad that it seriously tanks the rating that I would give this game from an 8.5-9 out of 10 to around a 7.7-7.8.  With that being said, if you are just some random gamer just looking to pick up and RPG then this game seriously is not for you. This game was aimed at more hardcore RPG fans which is why I have to give this game a thumbs down even if I want to give it a mixed opinion because for the average person this game probably isn't going to be worth it. That's not to say that this is a bad game because it's not bad in the slightest, it's just not good enough for the average person to pick it up and enjoy it.  I suggest that you watch a stream, gameplay review, or a let's play before buying this game because this is not like the first in the series either. So keep that in mind when you decide to buy this game. I  also put the game on the second hardest difficulty and was pretty much being forced to cheese my way through most fights which was very frustrating. It gets kinda better as you get good gear and stats but early on it's extremely difficult so keep that in mind as well if you are new to RPGs that you should not be cranking up the difficulty."

Bugs and ""What I hate"" list after 37 hours in the game: 1) Sneaking + ladders are buggy 2) Companions have problems with ladders very often 3) Comparing to first game here are a lot of frustrating ambush fights. Really do not like how many of them there are. 4) Complexity. Classic mode is not what it was from previous game, it's much harder. When switching to Traveler/Explorer mode it's very easy. So there is no suitable mode for me which really upsets me. 5) Bug: Sebilla's equipment inventory doesn't get shared items from common inventory after some time in game. 6) Have a feeling that sometimes enemies can shoot precisely through the edges of the wall/obstacle while I cannot because I am just a human. It's because AI can calculate exactly the exact place where to stand to shoot. I think that developers need to make enemies behave more like humans in this concern. 7) Frustrating diary logs. Too many records in the diary can be highlighted after some event occurs which is not good. 8) Battlefield becomes hardly visible if fire, smoke, poison are present. Especially - fire. I see that fire effects were greatly improved graphically but battlefield becomes hardly visible after all these effects. 9) Voices of NPCs are good but I have a feeling that compared to previous game they are not so distinct/clear. It's especially important for me as I am not native English speaker although I do understand English if person's voice is clear/distinct. 10) Waypoint. Why not making Waypoints links directly on the map? And why putting Waypoints menu to the main menu game? It was even better positioned in Original Sin 1. I really thought developers will implement Waypoints better in 2nd game but they did even worse.

Biggest problem is that the game is obviously in an unfinished state. It is riddled with bugs and the programming is very mediocre. Many of the bugs are completely game breaking, some even make you unable to progress through the game further. Combat, while admitedly fun, is based on a ridiculous double armor mechanic that makes the game a walk in the park after a few hours, when you understand how to exploit it. The number bloating is ridiculous, and equipment scales so fast that every time you level up you need to completely re-equip your whole party, redering any equipment you may find with great effort become completely useless after 20 minutes. The scaling system was obviously made by someone with a very deficitary knowledge of even the most basic mathematics. In sum: game had much promise, failed to deliver."
Aben,69,4,2,February 4,Not Recommended,486.2,"Balance is a bit off. As long as you have armor  you can not get CC'd. However, in the early game, armor is insufficient to make not getting CC'd a real option. If the fight has your party outnumbered, your health pool will not be sufficient to handle the focus fire that comes with the CC, and you will lose party members. Lose party members, and it is not likely that you can revive them successfully without repeating the cycle. It is possible to play with a solo talent that gives more actions and armor. This makes the game much more balanced early on if not too easy. In reflection, I feel that the experience to level is simply too steep and that if the levels would come quicker everything would be much more balanced. Around level 10-12 armor gets MUCH more powerful and the game seems like it balances back out before it gets easy end game.   The real issue I have with the game though is that in order to make your character powerful you MUST focus your attributes and skills sufficiently. If the attributes were slightly less dominant, then it might be possible to build a more broad character and enjoy the resulting flexibility. In the end, this was simply extremely difficult to do, and the balance issues noted caused me to stop playing. Too a long time messing with various character configurations before that point though."

Homongoloid,584,6,1,"September 29, 2017",Not Recommended,115.6,"I can't recommend this game in it's current state. It's currently so imbalanced and glitchy that I can't even properly enjoy it, it just frustrates me. If horrible bugs and horrible balance don't ruin the experience for you, and you're fine with the game feeling pretty indie (Conversations are entirely dialogue, for example, and actions are always narrated without ever even slightly matching what the models are actually doing) then it's a great game, and you should buy it on sale. But if you're picky, or annoyable, then I'd wait for them to fix these issues.. If they ever do, they were brought up before the game was released and they did nothing about them. I'd recommend the first game if you're going to get either, which has it's share of issues but not as many as this game.  If you want some very detailed information on this game, read this thread. It's very informative and goes quite in-depth to the balance issues of the game, but doesn't really talk about the glitches:  http://larian.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=621419&#Post621419  The thread summarized is how forcing enemies to go every other turn prevents strategy and can make killing enemies detrimental, the AI is both smart enough to be psychic to know everything about everyone while also stupid enough to walk away from you to hurt themself before turning around to hit you with an attack they were in range for the whole time, the new armour system hurts team compositions that aren't entirely physical (and preferably 2 lone wolves), the old defensive abilities were deleted in place of this new and bad armour system, there are tons of useless things that you should never level up / obtain, the butchering of the attributes and slaughtering of any depth or complexity, how initiative is completely useless, and a few other things.  What that thread doesn't talk about, however, is the bugs. The horrible bugs that are everywhere. Moving might sometimes take 1 more AP than it said it did, ruining your turn. Moving might hit you with an attack of opportunity, even though it didn't show the indicator that it would and you were hugging the enemy. Moving might make your party members run off in separate, random directions and engage combat. Moving through anything that is detrimental is incredibly annoying, since the pathfinder will do it's best to force you to not step into anything hazardous for even a millisecond (even though stepping in it does basically nothing), yet will have your followers loiter in shrieker death-zones for an hour until they die. Clicking on yourself to buff yourself, when you are clearly on the middle of your character, might target a corpse behind you and give the dead enemy armour instead. Clicking an enemy to attack them a second time will instead make you move if you clicked just slightly too quickly. Dialogue will sometimes not happen at all, skipping an entire part of the conversation leaving you confused, and when it does happen it may or may not have even half of what was said. Dialogue automatically starting and being unjoinable for party members, so only one person can enjoy it. Or how vital NPCs may not spawn, triggers may not happen, and your dialogue choices won't register so you keep repeating the conversations repeatedly.  Even without counting how annoying all of the bugs are, the game's balance is still undesirable at best. You're given 4 Action Points per turn, which is what you use to do your actions, and it has a cap of 6, meaning you reach the full extent of what you can do in one turn in 1.5 turns. In the first game you had 7 max AP and every point of Constitution you levelled up, you would get one more AP. This let you actually do more things than just punch someone twice, or walk a little close then punch them once. In the first game, you could actually allocate your stats to what you think would be best. There were defensive things, offensive things, spell things, a bunch of stuff. In this, it's basically +5% damage or putting it into a spell school so you're better at casting that kind of spell. You can't increase your baby-sized AP unless you halve your party size, you can't get abilities to resist CC since the armour removes any anticipation and just makes everything ""Definitely"" or ""Definitely not"", you can't do anything about how you build your character other than ""Slightly stronger"" or ""Can now also get this school of magic"".  There's a mod to give you 8 max AP, but mods disable achievements. There's a mod to halve armour and add it to VIT so that mixed teams can work, and crowd controls ever see any use. But mods disable achievements. There's a mod that lowers the cooldown of mage spells since mages are severely underpowered... but mods disable achievements. There's a mod that makes it so that things don't just constantly get spammed onto your hotbar, filling up any open slot there is even if it's before the end of the hotbar, making the hotbar the most disorganized thing in existence that requires constant upkeep to make it not horribly ugly, but mods disable achievements. There's mods to slow down levelling, or lower the huge difference between levels because currently you have to swap out gear every level because of the giant bloat between levels, but mods disable achievements.  I know I'm forgetting at least half of what I want to write about, so I'll probably update this review later. If they fix enough of these issues I'll change the review from negative to positive."

She comes across as the game writer's personal character who gets to sweep in and save the day constantly, as if this is her story not ours.  The battles and dungeons in the last third of the game really become a chore. They are creative, sure, but they usually result in infinite respawing enemies while you attempt to go around and solve a puzzle. It just becomes more aggravating than enjoyable at that point. The moment to moment gameplay is just as fun as the first game, with the elemental aspects returning.

Jackson TC,30,2,0,July 20,Not Recommended,7.0,"This is my first time playing a PC RPG and, as such, my review has to be viewed with such a lens.  While I don't consider myself to be entirely helpless when it comes to role-playing games in general, I feel absolutely helpless here.  The game tosses you into a completely open world with no clear direction on which path you're supposed to take, with a battle system that punishes your lack of mechanical knowledge and immediately scales into party-killing fights within the first two hours.  I felt that I had two options going forward - replay the game on the lowest difficulty until I could understand it, or invest my time elsewhere.  I choose the latter."
Rayko,102,2,1,May 12,Not Recommended,24.0,"The game did not improve much on the previous game. I couldn’t make myself to go through the Fort Joy. I cannot recommend this to anyone who’d like to find interesting characters and see how their story evolves.  Dialogue system is inferior. Answer options do not differ much, sometimes being just variations of the same reaction. Often the details in the answers are unnecessary, stupid or cringeworthy. These options do not provide enough freedom to build a character and to feel any connection with your actions.   NPC characters are mostly written to be killed during the first or second encounter and are forgettable. Sometimes NPC do something to your character in their replies, which is extremely annoying, as well as the game’s commitment to make potentially hostile NPCs also a – somewhat – valuable traders.   Pacing is terrible; everything is thrown at you at once: quests, NPC, events. Freedom of movement is an illusion since you ever want to go somewhere when you are either looking for a fight, or for a trader. For this reason, making your party is immensely bothersome at the beginning of the game, as you have limited access to functionally necessary equipment.  For the mechanics, they are fine, better than in the previous game. Some might find joy in minmaxing it. For me, the setting and pacing pretty much ruin the experience and make me regret spending so much time trying to like it."

Knightly Knave,575,1,0,June 30,Not Recommended,88.1,"I have to say this game was really disappointing. The first one is far better. It mostly comes down to this game being really glitchy. There are so many times a quest didn't complete properly or a combat sequence glitched out and I had to restart. The characters are all pretty one note. Malady in particular is terrible. She comes across as the game writer's personal character who gets to sweep in and save the day constantly, as if this is her story not ours.  The battles and dungeons in the last third of the game really become a chore. They are creative, sure, but they usually result in infinite respawing enemies while you attempt to go around and solve a puzzle. It just becomes more aggravating than enjoyable at that point. The moment to moment gameplay is just as fun as the first game, with the elemental aspects returning. The co-op is fairly good but also leads to even more bugs, especially in any scenes where you're supposed to fight each other, like at the arenas of the one.  If you really want to play a game like this I recommend just playing the first one and skipping this one."

Berserker Queen,87,No,0,October 30,Not Recommended,54.7,"Mixed Review, If I could. The game has been thoroughly praised, so I'll quickly focus on the shortcomings: the combat and the story.   The combat, despite surprisingly innovative in the isometric RPG genre, is clunky and repetitive, as the armor system gimps crowd control and pushes you towards a non-mixed party. Besides, it's unbalanced. For players used to the genre, Classic difficulty allows you to steamroll everything, while Tactician's difficulty forces you to both milk the looting and stealing system to it's ultimate maximum, so as to empower yourself as much as you can, and cheapening every battle possible, like engaging people from the UBER IDEAL angle with the UBER IDEAL positioning, which ruins immersion and roleplay. The game perfectly shows how something new or different isn’t necessarily something better.  The story, from its part, is entirely monotonous. It’s one thing to be an important character, it’s another to be the Alpha and Omega to extents in which secondary characters and personal stories from absolutely unrelated people either serve only to make you more alpha and omega or are entirely cast aside. The straw on the camel’s back for me, was, first, *spoilers* the woman who destroys the initial ship being easily killed in a senseless fight and then the seekers on the island being absolutely erased after the end of Chapter 2. Characters and developments are absolutely forgotten and swept aside – the important part, the game never ceases to remind you, is that you’re the Divine. ♥♥♥♥ everything else.  Now, the graphics are gorgeous and detailed, the music and sound effects are immersive, if not entirely memorable, the animations are fun and varied and they really showed us a whole new way of fighting in a medieval fantasy setting – but if combat end up being a chore and the writing is bland, the game just isn’t fun."

wm.j.olson,138,33,5,"September 15, 2017",Not Recommended,26.3,"This issue of the game has serious balance problems. Virtually every fight early on you face opponents who individually or in the 'army' they can summon immediately overwhelm. There is basically no way to win confrontations with over-powered enemies. Enemies you stumble into are always levels above you or your team, armed with better weapons, have more skills, and better protection.  The learning curve depends on saving every turn and reloading when you lose, only to stumble into anothr no-win situation.   In the meantime, because everything you can buy is overpriced and what you sell mostly sells for peanuts, you can't earn money to buy better stuff.  Nor is it possible to complete missions and engage in combat to improve skills. So constant save and reload to dodge encounters, which of course means you can't earn experience just rinse and repeat hoping for the best the next time.  You can create your own character but you can't save it.  So, if you want to start again, you can't load the character you created.  There's basically no in-game tutorial that helps or explains what's going on or what to look for.  The few things covered have descriptions that are next to useless.  You can choose various skills with weapons that require certain attibutes, like finesse.  Fine.  What weapons does that support and where do you find the answer?  Someplace like YouTube or discussions elsewhere other than the game.  Compared to the other Divinity games, this one comes up short.  There's a system to identify collectable objects, since the game world is full of things, but the system doesn't cover much of what is there, so it's trial and error, hit and miss.  The game is now out of early access but it feels and plays like much remains to be done and it is not clear if the developers will respond to the need."
Tjaranis,181,10,0,"September 17, 2017",Not Recommended,37.7,"Ok so whats wrong with the game:  1.	Controls are really bad in combat, you can barely zoom, clicking your characters to do something is tricky and I’ve had 3 times I’ve lost an extremely long and hard fight because the game didn’t register that I clicked a character with a skill and instead just walked like an idiot. 2.	Skill/attack look is boring/bad It looks/feels exactly like the style of game before 2000, there have been done nothing to make it feel like an actual battle, so combat looks incredibly dull and boring. 3.	Balance is utterly crap, like every DnD based game you either build exploitive and become OP as hell, or build as you like “rp wise” and suck hard at the game (stats means so much bc dnd system). 4.	It is both exceptional linear and at the same time there is no redline to follow. So you need to progress and the game is all about getting from story point A to B and there is little to do in between, but the guidance of the story, motivation and making you feel there is a story at all just isn’t there. So I must admit after 5-6 hours in the game (19hours played) I had +- given up on the story, not because it would be to hard to follow but because it was pointless as nothing I did had any effect (killing all guards, prisoners still just stand stupid. Winning arena, npc only remove neck from your main ignore the rest of the team. Interactions are very limited and there is no feeling of atmosphere or reason to do anything or not do something. Its trail and error on what works and doesn’t). 5.	Its locking all your costumization on ONE click, so better not misclick when checking what stats does or you have to reload/reroll. Costumizations are like all other DnD systems “read a guide or replay a LOT”. edit(you can costumize later on a ship, but even here switching companions will be insanely expensive as they dont have the skills and thats another issue with skill pricing and acquirement) 6.	Battle’s difficulty goes from “easy mode one fight” and 2 seconds later it is just “2war,2wiz,1boss,2 monster” and roughly double the power of your team. Not impossible but the absurd difference is just ridicules. 7.	NPC’s and You. It doesn’t seem at all like they tested stuff, so as an undead I’ve had someone ask me to bed by touching me, had the text say I got drunk (even though I am immune), having my heart beat quickly etc. idiocy… 8.	The game just isn’t fun, it is average when its good and rage worthy for every time you reach bugs, misclick, unfair fights out of nowhere, etc. 9. it feels like you are a creature from another dimension and nothing you touch or do in the world changes in the dimension the npc's are in, so you can interact with them but nothing you do to the world around them ever changes in their mind/dimension. this also makes it feel very immersion breaking.  So I cant recommend it. To much focus on recreating an exact copy of the pre 2000 rpg’s instead of improving much more on it both animation, story, and living world wise.  edit: explosive corrected to exploitive, not sure if it is a word but we all know what it means ;) and typo's. added 9."

If you had the intentions of playing with a friend, be warrned the game treats both of you as the main player so both of you have to talk to the same characters a lot of the time. another warnning if you planned on playing any hybrid characters, like a battlemage, expect to be behind in eveyrthign from health to damage to utility forever, or untill you use a magical deivce which lets you respect your character as many times as you like after the first act  edit: i dont think its a bad game, just not a game i can recomend, but id love to hear other peoples thoughts on what i said."
Robobob,80,9,2,"October 2, 2017",Not Recommended,61.4,"I want to love this game so bad but just found it needlessly difficult and time consuming at just average difficulty.  It seems like every single enemy is capable of range attacks, area attacks and teleporting around the battlefield.  Every battelfield is littered with oil, fire, ice, poison, etc so that you can't take a single step without taking additional damage.  Why is does every single range skill have splash damage and alter the battelfield. You have to laugh at a game that gives you a half a dozen resurrection scrolls by level 2, because you know it's going to be a struggle.  The fights aren't impossible it's just that after 45 hours I'm at level 8 and that's half the time spent at mastering and completing games like Skyrim, Dragon Age, Witcher 3, Baldur's Gate.  As an experienced RPG lover I find it insulting to drop the diffculty to easy just to playthrough.  And normal difficulty is too much so I guess this game isn't for me.

They like stopping your movements mid way with stupid errors like ""Path was blocked"" and not refund any of your AP. They think Spacebar is a good place to put ""End Turn"". They like their combat system prone to mistakes of a single mouse click. Oops! I didn't mean to move or attack that, stupid game...  If you like to constantly save before every person you talk to, every cave you walk into, and after every thing you do, just to know that you'll be hitting F8 to reload it in no time. Dumb game systems. Very unpolished, unclear, and unfair combat.  The whole beginning of the game has no linear movement. They want you to ""figure out"" that you can't do that quest yet by dying or failing it and come back later. Every fight you are outnumbered and overpowered. Dumb system.  This game purely likes to waste your time and make your life more difficult, when it could make more sense.  WAY OVERRATED  No refund either.

elise_paulis,38,5,3,"December 27, 2017",Not Recommended,135.5,"Been looking forward to this game for a long time because I loved the previous Divinity titles. I love the combat style, the humor, the dialogues, but sadly the game has become completely unplayable due to the worst optimalisation I've seen in years.  Even on a relatively new PC it´s completely unplayable after Act 1 due to long loading times and stuttering. It´s a common problem which hasn´t been patched as yet. The game demands an unreasonable amount of processing power. My PC has a i5 processor and a GTX 1060 graphics card, which should be well within minimum requirements, yet it's still a massive slideshow even at the lowest graphics settings.  It´s a real shame, because I really enjoyed the game at the start. Act 1 was great to play, with a lot of winks and nudges towards the other games in the series. But as soon as I got off the boat in Act 2 the game became completely unplayable, taking up to 5 minutes to load a savegame and half a minute to pick up a single item. Updated my graphics drivers, got rid of old savegames, set all graphics settings to very low, but nothing helped to ease the demands on my CPU.  I had to abandon the game after really enjoying the first part :(  Don't leave your fans hanging, Larian Studios, please patch this game!"
ScrubZero,188,4,0,"September 27, 2017",Not Recommended,147.3,"The game is good and fun to play, blah blah, all that stuff. Problem is, the whole thing is buggy as ♥♥♥♥. Bugs are literally everywhere, be it in combat, in menus, everywhere. Some are minor, some are major, some are gamebreaking. I bought it, but if i knew how bugged this was i wouldn't have. If you buy this game you're supporting a company that after MONTHS in early access could not fix something as simple as quests not updating in journal, player-created undead not getting their immunities (bleed immunity, suffocation immunity etc.), and even some crashes. As a QAF tester myself i can assure you most of these bugs were in fact reported, the developer just didn't bother fixing them thinking they could get away with fixing them in future patches, or not fixing them at all.  Should the devs get their heads out of their asses and fix majority of this garbage, i will change my review."
Asriel~,138,4,2,October 13,Not Recommended,269.2,"(First off, I'd like to say that I'm not a troll, and am merely attempting to provide decent information as to why this game is, as said in the title ""pretty bad"".)  I've played this game for around 150 hours, and during that time I've discovered countless problems. The main one that has caused me to lose faith in this game is it's weak plot armour. Sure, they've implemented the fact that if you kill anyone the game doesn't stop you from progressing, but there are a select few NPCs that are either unkillable or transform into a dragon and fly away (I'm looking at you Dallis). It completely broke the immersion for me, even though I know she's required to further the plot, it just feels rather improvised and that Larian could've found a better way of portraying their immortality rather than a variation of ""Rocks fall, everyone dies"". Hell, I would've even preferred Physical Immunity over this. The second larger problem with the game in my opinion is the combat system in general. I could list off a couple pages worth of issues with said system, but instead am going to give some of the more noticeable ones such as stealth in combat, which for the most part means cooldown reset button, the armour system, which is pretty self-explanatory, and AI's damage output, which for the most part rends the only thing between you and getting stunlocked to shreds. There are like I previously mentioned, quite a number of other less ""cheesy"" issues with the system that I won't cover in fear of making this a full-fledged book. Now that I've finished naming the two main problems with the game in general, I'll get into listing some of the smaller bugs/problems with the game that are less pressing but still somewhat irritating. Frequent crashes on loading a save, doesn't matter if you have mods or not, this will always haunt you. Difficulty system just makes enemies more spongy, including their armour, which makes them almost impossible to kill when trying to solo the game. Teleportation skill in general can be pretty OP especially when used in a form of ""Hit And Run"", allowing you to whittle down the enemies ranks before facing them as a whole. Crafting has little to no use in the game, unless providing boosts to weaponry. Linearity didn't bother me for the first couple playthroughs, but past that point, It can get pretty boring. Quests provide little to no information on where to go or what to do, instead causing you to blindly stumble around, hoping to discover the answer to a question, or key to a door. Thievery gives no difficulty whatsoever, allowing you to take what you please without any chance of being caught. Talent values are incredibly unbalanced, where some give you gamebreaking skill boosts, others do next to nothing. Experience is given in very small quantities when completing quests, meaning in order to keep up with the enemies, you have to kill a decent amount of NPCs, which can be pretty immersion-breaking when attempting to roleplay as somebody besides a mass murderer.  Hope this has helped at least a few people save their money."
StrangestSilence,102,3,0,July 17,Not Recommended,49.6,"Please consider reading, It is a long but easy to read and informing opinion of a disenchanted buyer. I used cheat engine in some parts --it doesn’t contain spoilers, obviously-- Remember that in all my playthrough I looked forward to use the least ressurect spells that I could, because they are pretty expensive to buy and steal. This is very important on the criticism that I have  The story seems to be nice and it revives aspects and character from the first game (which is not required to play in order to understand this one), and certain things that bothered me in the first still continues on this game, like the little lore things being only explained by the books, traps in ridiculous places (like under a sinked boat. A sinked boat….) and the unclearance of ---certain--- quests, I say it cause the first game didnt give you at all, sometimes you selected any random dialogue cause you get bored by the voice of the character, the way she speaks or even cause she speaks too much and even tho you can still do it, the journal and the map helps much more  The skills are better to learn, requiring you to just level up your memory in the attributes menu instead of levelling a skill to its maximum to find out that you can only learn 3 master skills like in the first game. Also, there is no distinction over the rank of a skill, a skill is just a skill like its supposed to be.  The traits are now a dialogue option, but you don’t get them so easy and as far as I played I only get “hero”, not even giving me bonuses for my conducts  The beginning of the game leaves you stranded on the island youre supposed to get with only the items of the class that you chose, and it stays like that for pretty much the rest of the day. And I mean it, at the end of the day (if you get immersed in the history and the dialogues) you will find yourself wearing the same clothes, cause is hard as hell to get money to buy things for your characters and you only start getting things after lvl 5 or so. But don’t think my complains make no sense, cause it takes some time for you to get there and actually nice items are only in act 2 forward   You got to choose neo, rather this armor go to this fighter or this knight. At the end of the day someone is going to die anyway…. Jokes on you for buying resurrect scrolls!  “Oh but I can pickpocket” No. just, no. you can only pickpocket NPCs once for character. I couldn’t find a reason for that cause you can get high amount of money in late game, which translating is about 15 hours to 30, if you don’t take a thievery skill right at the start youre ♥♥♥♥ed up, the next point in ‘civil abilities’ will be only at level 2 (it means a simple fight at the beach), then 6 or something. If you want a thief in your crew be sure to skip all combats as soon as you get to the island and ask Sebille to join you (at the south, right before the sand next to the doctor)  If you pickpocket someone to get items at the beginning, you wont be able to do it again for the rest of the game with the character chosen. This game is all about choices, a full dps character? A dirty thief? A support mage? A tanker? Should I get this skillbook that my party really need or this chest armor that my warrior need in order to keep ♥♥♥♥♥es away from the source of damage? Cause I don’t only have WHEIGHT limitations over what I can steal, I also have VALUE AT THE SAME TIME. Of course it upgrades, but till that point is 20 hours of pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and in the back until you don’t even need to pickpocket anymore    That’s why I don’t used to pickpocket resurrect scrolls  “But why all of this items matter? I can be polite and educated, and thus, avoiding battles!” You’ll have to battle sometime. And the battle changed for worse, much much worse  —DOS 2 adopted a system which you need to be pretty much a NUKE in order to crowd control or even kill someone.—  You have armors now, which means that you can get a battering ram in your face and not get knocked down (if it don’t break through you armor) and you can walk in fire without get burned, sounds good enough, right?  WRONG, FOR ♥♥♥♥ SAKE NO  Remember when I told you that for the time that seems like an eternity you will get no equipment? That means nothing or close to nothing protection while the enemies have around 100. So the choice gets harder now, cause a thief isn’t really helpful in early battle if you want it to be a proper thief from the beginning, and a tanker wont deal the damage like the thief does   My first battle issue was with the AP bar, that makes you do everything with just one AP and just use the rest to walk or use skills. It gives too much power to one point and limits me in a certain way instead of making walking more easier, for example. Sure you can walk further more with this system, but walking does not deal damage. I look at a bar with 6 AP and it makes me desperate, im in a fight with 6 guys, has to control them, my armor will vanish by the second turn, and the enemies cleverly do not target the tank, and just one AP sometimes feel to turn the tides of the battle. Sometimes I believe that it was intentional, as the elves got an ability to recover AP points  Another battle issue is that DOS 1 doesn’t requires you to talk to everyone in normal difficulty, when it’s the first time playing the game its actually nice to talk and to know everybody, but when you are playing for the second time (or created a second party cause you didn’t know what the game was like in your first playthrough) you want to skip some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and jump right to the almighty battle (which is the best, damn the game just nailed it). I am talking about the first game, in classic mode, in the first location, that lets you go anywhere that with some effort you manage to kill the enemies. BUT, if youre going to play on tactician mode, the game makes the path in which you are supposed to follow very clear, it makes a crowd of enemies with 3 level difference almost impossible, depending on who youre fighting with DOS 2 is always in tactician mode my dudes. Always. If your strategy is not the best (especially in the first act) prepare your♥♥♥♥♥ cause you are the lucky boi that depends on luck and luck alone.  Luck that you will hit that strike, luck that the AI wont strike that character, or wont go that way, or luck that he will slip in the ice (most likely wont) luck this and luck that. Unfairness   It makes me force to load and save almost constantly, which is something that I barely did in DOS 1 (except for those ridiculous rock paper scissors minigame, im glad that they’re gone)  DOS 1 has a scalling problem with skills, the game gets easier when you start the second “act” or second map, I guess the armor is a lazy way to balance that out  Now, I guess is time to explain cheat engine issue. There is no better situation than the boss that finishes the first act, it goes like this:  You are greatly outnumbered and can use the scenario at your favor in one specific place only, so you do You struggle to create a crowd control because  	1 – you are two levels below the boss and this hasn’t being a issue at all until now 	2 – at least 3 guys got a armor almost the size of your health 	3 – you cant pierce through any armor, cant stun, cant knock down 	4 – only one character has teleportation, but only one doesn’t know how to climb down stairs anyway You manage to not get anyone of your party killed in 3 rounds, isolate some guys and seems to be doing fine You finally pierce through the boss physical armor, but the jokes on you because now everyone is blind The whole party got half of HP A GIANT WORM GETS OUT OF THE EARTH AND IT HAS DOUBLE THE AMOUT OF THE BOSS’S HP AND ARMOUR, THE ROOM BEHIND YOU IS CURSED AND THE OTHER ON YOUR SIDE GOT 3 OHKO JESUS WANNABE ***YOUR TURN***"

I have been playing since the first Divinity. However my favorite entry in the series is still Divinity II. I loved the third person engine in that game and it felt like a step forwards for the series. Sadly the last two Original Sin entries feel like a step backwards. Not in story but in execution. Try as I might I just cannot get into the Isometric style of this current game. The story is great but the gameplay is frustrating. Not being unable to climb up onto a ledge that is one foot higher than the one I am on just got too frustrating. Especially when on the very same map you can traverse a rock slide. After the umpteenth 'Cannot Reach' message and having to spin the view around to see where I was I just gave up.

Hagaroth,10,9,3,June 24,Not Recommended,49.7,"So after about 40+ hours in a single playthrough of this game I got to the end and just quit. This was a slow build up to me quitting that started with the end of Stage 1 of the game. At the end of stage 1 it turned out that I had missed about 5-7 quests and 2 party members that I did not know existed or could have even been party members. So I had 2 less options in party members right off the bat. This is because in this game you have to go through the grueling task of talking to every single character, read every single book, click every single opbest that can be clicked, and read through every single piece of dialogue. However, doing all of those things is not rewarding at all. It's not like there are 5 objects to click and 1 of them leads to a quest. No, there are 100 objects to click and 1 leads to a quest, or rather a single part of a 20 long chain of quest updates before you can actually finish 1 quest.  The dialogue in this game is highly acclaimed by a lot of people as being in depth and complex, but it is not. Everything you say comes down to light side or dark side and there is no in-between. I started out the game reading every single line of dialogue and carefully considering every choice I made, until I found out that simply mashing 1 did the exact same thing 99% of the time that I wanted to do anyways.  Combat is slow and there is no way to speed it up. It is also boring because while the game's creators boast that there are so many skill options and build options (which to their credit there is), only about 3 are viable. I started the game on the middle difficulty and lost the second fight of the game 3 times. That should not be possible. So then I went to Google and found out that apparently I chose the weakest build. Yay! After getting the right build (and scaling down the difficulty to the lowest setting) I found out that combat was a simple ""if A, then B"" and then you win. Not very strategic. Even on the lowest difficulty though I found some fights taking over an hour to do, most of that time being spent watching the enemy move slowly and casting animations. Even if you love this combat style, it is so slow you will come to hate it.  Exploration is a must in this game, but it becomes really tedious. The quest updates are unhelpful and vague. Not even Morrowind vague like ""go southeast and the object is in the Cave of Whatever"". It is more like ""Huh, the object isn't here, we will have to find it."" Great, where do I start to look for it? Everywhere, is the game's response. Go everywhere, talk to literally everyone, and after 3 hours of that you just might find it, or Google it. I started the game loving the exploration, and ended it by just Googling everything because 40+ hours in a single gameplay, the vast majority of it was running around the same area I had been in before trying to figure out where to go next. That is where your time will go. Not exploring the wonderful world they made for you, but running around bored out of your mind because you just want to finish the quest and move on. This occurs for the main quests too, not just side quests. The side quests range from super easy to get through, with flags on the map telling you where to go, to forget trying to figure it out and just Google it.  Play time is boasted as 100+ hours of gameplay. Not really. If the game was as simple to follow as Skyrim and the combat about as quick, the game would be about 20 hours long. Instead of it being like that they make things purposefully difficult to find and follow and get through so that you have to spend more time. It didn't make the game richer for me at all, just boring.  Quests get worse and worse as the game goes on. All of the great stuff that you can do and how seemingly innocuous things lead to big quests are literally at the start of the game. That is because each quest has progression points until you finally finish it. That is all well and good at the start of the game where there are 3-5 things to do to finish a quest, but after the first stage of the game it becomes like 10-20 things you need to do to finish 1 quest, and each section of the game has 10 quests. The quests are also set up like the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. Do A, which leads to B, and so on until you are done. However, unlike Witcher, doing A gives you no clues at all as to what B is. So each quest takes forever and a day to do, unless you just Google it, but then all of the fun of figuring it out is gone, but if you do try to figure it out it takes so long that it isn't fun anyways anymore.  Puzzles are scattered throughout the game, but they are Skyrim levels of ""Just Google it"". Basically the puzzles go ""hey, guess the 5 letter combination,"" so you try 1 combination, die, reset, try another, die, reset, rinse and repeat. Fun.  Story. The story is the same as every Elder Scrolls game, and Elder Scrolls does it better. Seriously, without posting spoilers, it is literally the exact same thing.  Overall I got so bored with the game that I just wanted to finish it. I got to the end, Googled what I had to do after 5 hours of running around, and found out that it was so tedious and downright stupid that I just called it quits."

I did my research and thought this game sounded nice. I started on medium, and I realized two things. One: the battles are stupidly hard, you barely stand a chance against things your own level, Two: the complete lack of ways to gain XP or make money make progressing a slow druge through terrible battles that I just have no time for. Sucks they decided gateing the story behind tedium was the way they wanted to go.  I understand a lot of people enjoy this type of thing, but for my taste this is FAR too slow. The witcher 3 I think is an example of a game that does this right, it feels difficult but it also feels like you can do things to curb the difficulty when you need to, grinding or going on side quests. This game does nothing to point you toward any side quests or even give you options to grind for gold / xp so you can progress. Sad but to each their own. Enjoy guys, even if I can't!"
themikeyoulike,4,8,1,September 3,Not Recommended,171.1,"Perhaps individuals are polarized when it comes to this game. I've now invested enough time in the game to get to level 14. I have to say it hasn't been an enjoyable experience. In fact it's been masochistic. It's almost as though the developers wanted to punish the gamer for playing this style of game.    It's been a laborious grind to achieve levels, forcing one to kill all types of NPCs to gain levels simply to take on the progressively demanding elements of the game. The parsimonious way in which leveling opportunities are availed to players is frustrating. Creatures or challenges do not re-spawn and paired with the weak continuity of the game narrative, a player is forced to roam haphazardly throughout the world in search of clues. Essentially an exercise in wasting time.   Not a game I recommend if you like fluid continuity in the gaming experience. A good example of a game that flows is Grimm Dawn.   Furthermore, the camera angles are terrible. It's almost as though the developers got lazy and didn't wan't to render a horizontal third-person perspective. I've honestly never seen a game where such a perspective isn't included. And I think it's a poor way of increasing the difficulty level of a game.  One could argue that eliminating a mouse, keyboard or decreasing the viewable space of  world could increase difficulty but that is truly low hanging fruit.   I truly don't see what the vast appeal of the game is. And because there are no trial versions of the game You'll have to risk playing the game before you'll know if it's for you.   Good luck."

Lockebone,43,6,2,September 6,Not Recommended,5.1,"only spoilers are for the first couple hours.  Its definately just me but this game is not as good as everybody says it is.   The story is rather dull, and almost breaks the 4th wall multiple times in the very beginning hours. I see how little hours ive played but that doesnt count the time I have also spent playing on the console versions of both games.   Besides that. The story is plain, dull, and possibly gets better the deeper you go. But with 10 other games I want to play that have come out, do I have time to care about a game that can not set its hook in me after the first 10 hours or so of gameplay.   Having played and beaten tons of games of this genre. Let me explain why I feel this way.   1. The 4th wall almost being broken really perturbs me. Maybe I am interpreting things wrong.   2. The dialogue is veryyy boring, pretentious, makes fun of gaming and ADND type playing. Another thing other people don't see but I felt that way. Mostly when dealing with the NPC's and the reactions and way they are represented.   3. The interactions between charactors. So I am a source connected (potential terrorist) to the people in control, I am captured and sent on a ship to prison, basically a genocide camp. At this camp, the people are allowed to just wonder around, with that, they are allowed weapons, flasks of poison and fire are ALL OVER THE PLACE. Really? Wtf kind of government allows its feared people that it has already illegally arrested to wonder around with weapons.   4. For example. A magistar is killed right after you get to the island, I think partially to give you story info with eating her body parts as an elf or something, also to illustrate the pure cruelty of the magistars. Forcing one of there own kind to publically cut out her own tongue and then just blast her and kill her.  But me a source connected guy who OPENLY disobeys everything she says is allowed to just walk away, with a group of weapon wielding adventures on my heels.   I am sorry. I understand why everybody likes the game. It can be a lot of fun. But also. its not a 9/10, objectively its well crafted, with difficult controls even on a PC, excellent graphics, that show you details of items and people that have probably never before been seen or done in this genre of gaming.   But I cannot get over what I would call poor effort into the Sociology and Psychology actions of the environment and people living in it.   Weapons, flasks, potions and all those things should not just be lying around all over the place. Prisoners are never allowed to roam free, empowered mythical beings with magic powers and weapons of great power would NEVER allow insubordination such as I provoke go unpunished. The controls are tight but also complicated, detail orientated, and not for people who have trouble seeing small objects. As you can indeed zoom in, try playing an rpg like this zoomed in.   All in all, its a love story to classic games of the same genre, with twists put on the traditional gaming tropes related to fantasy games that seem to be put there merely to throw the trope away.   Such as the lizard folk being the intelligent ones and the elves being wild humanoids that devour body parts. Completely reversing how this traditionaly would go.   I guess my overall point here is this, like mass effect, the choices you make and things you do, to me almost seem pointless as the story will push forward no matter what, its overly complicated JUST TO BE COMPLICATED, which makes the mechanics not fun but more of a chore required to be used to play the game (my past 30 years of ADND and RPG gaming experience should be enough).   Not downplaying the amazing work done here for the genre and the fact that many if not everybody will probably have a good time with this game.   But ehhh. It could have been better. Stop riding the bandwagon so hard and really ask yourselves. Objectively.   Is this as good as everybody says it is?"
CoolestCat,144,26,2,"September 15, 2017",Not Recommended,36.2,"Great game, awesome voiceovers and story potential for party play. However two major issues that don't cut it for me:  Backtracking The level and gear progression seems off with the amount of content there is per area. You need to be EXTREMELY careful not to miss ANYTHING or else in the next area you'll get the message the mobs are too strong and get completely overwhelmed in sheer numbers and power.   For people that like to explore and check every nook and cranny this is not a problem. For people that would like to just get on with the story it's bloody annoying going back to old areas to kill mobs that have been skipped to catch up levels and farm gold to upgrade gear. The progression in this game does NOT feel natural at all.  Oversimplified combat The combat feels nice and original at first. But sooner or later it became clear that a few tactics that worked at the start can be readily applied to 90% of the encounters. I was expecting combat where planning and strategy were key to victory.  It lacks diversity and variety that could have been done much better.   It is cool that elements can be used as a combo e.g. oil + fire. The cooldown of skills need to be looked at though, because often I cast my spells and use my abilities, and then it's back to normal attacks for a few turns (not for all classes) which is boring and limits strategy if my only option is to autoattack when all skills have been used and are on cooldown for all partymembers. This is especially true early game, less late game when you get more skills.   If these points don't concern you then it's a great game, otherwise it feels unpolished and lacking."

Nemo,19,10,0,"September 21, 2017",Not Recommended,5.2,"I brought this game to experience a traditional Western RPG with elaborate dialogue and detailed world building that I heard so much about. Hasn't disappoint on the dialogue front so far but ... I can’t say much more than that.  I started playing on Classic, the 2nd lowest difficulty, my success rate in battle has been about 30%. Maybe this is old hat for veterans of the genre but as a newcomer this has been absolutely brutal. There is little to no introduction to the combat mechanics - it has really made me appreciate the “handholding” most AAA developers like Blizzard and Square Enix provide.  Maybe I will give the game another shot in a few months - too late for a refund anyway.  Recommended if you have experience with the genre. Not recommended if you are a total noob and like getting into games quickly without too much fuss.  On a technical front, it runs pretty well on my setup. No problems there.  PS: I selected ""Not Recommended"" assuming you are someone like me since ""Yes"" and ""No"" are the only 2 options provided by Steam - it's really more of a ""It depends.""

Tiriuss,233,No,0,June 22,Not Recommended,116.2,"I want to suggest this game really badly, having finished it and having a great time through the first half of the game. However as you delve deeper you can tell the game was rushed near the end, many quests often breaking and a bland (and overall disappointing) ending makes me hesitate.   Besides that, I have a few gripes about the game that stick out like a sore thumb the more you try and ignore them. One of which is the origin character system, which kind of makes it silly to create your own character because you're going to be missing out on content (and story). Still I wanted to create my own character so I went ahead with it, and throughout the whole game you pretty much get it sticked in your face that you made the wrong decision. You bump into origin only side quests almost as much as you bump into voidwoken.   It's a good game, but I think the Very Positive score is a little generous, so I'm giving it a thumbs down until I change my mind at least."
Vorx the Siegemaster,448,5,0,"October 11, 2017",Not Recommended,83.3,"It visually stunning. It has some good voice acting and some cool backgrounds to the heroes. It even has some fun skill building strategy. I have over 80 hours in this game and more than that in its predecessor. I enjoyed the first one.  But that's where it ends. There are tedious puzzles (the ones at the very end of the game being the worst) and illogical mechanics (for example, you can't take any items from dead party members, so if they went down with the Ressurection scroll you're screwed.) The worst is the quest design which means a lot of wasted time running around trying to figure out what ridiculous element you missed so you have to load a save from three days ago. There are also issues with NPCs disappearing after certain points in quest so you can't follow up and close the quest line.   Top it off with another tired and boring story about the main protagonist being touched by divine power and his ascent to godhood. YAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWN. That's been old since before Baldur's Gate. So why not try to mess with the formula and do something different? I was hoping they would be a little more creative with a tired trope in CRPGs. I expected too much.  I gave this game a lot of chances to impress me, and in a few rare instances it did. But it felt more like a chore."

Serpent King,118,4,5,October 5,Not Recommended,350.8,"I will be honest - I started out loving the game and went straight for the taction difficulty. It was a breeze until Act 2 when I arrived at Reapers Coast. Then it suddenly became impossible; every single enemy was 3-5 levels higher than me, they all had 4 times my shields, 2-3 times my HP, and 2-3 times my DMG not to mention I was always holariously outnumbered...   I decided I must have done something wrong because the game was supposed to be challenging, not impossible so I restarted it. I did some research, read about what people were doing that works well, and made a better line up. This time Act 1 at Fort Joy wasn't just a breeze, it was a joke. I made sure to be very thorrow discovering all the secrets and completing all the quest. I was sure that this time I will arrive at Reapers Coast more prepared and will be able to get around. But no, wrong again. This time I was able to defeat the weakest enemies around from like 10th attemt. The game went something like this: SAVE, DIE, LOAD... REAPEAT!!! This went on for hours until I slowly discovered half the map, talked to a bunch of NPCs, and did the easiest quests. And of course I had to skip about 90% of all combat because most of the time my party was wiped out during the first turn.  Now I find myself stuck. I can not progress any further for this reason or that, mostly because I get wiped out by enemies who are on average 2-3 times stronger than me. And honestly, I find myself out of will to even try. I grew up playing strategies and am not accustomed to being defeated by a computer, especially if I spent hours researching and making sure to do everything by the book and even better. The undeniable truth here is, the difficulty of Divinity 2 is COMPLETELY 100% ARTIFICIAL. Meaning it is not hard because the computer is a better strategist or because I am making any mistakes - it is hard because the developers decided to give the NPCs a completely unfair advantage. Even the enemies of the same level have anywhere between 1.5 to 2 times my shields (4-8 times my magic shields which is absolutely insane), 1.5 to 2 times my HP, 2 times my DMG, and higher initiative meaning they always go first... All I have to say is this - if you are going to make a game and call it strategy, don't be a moron and give one side such a huge advantage. So hey devs, what would you say to a game of chess? A game that I will start with 4 queens and you with 0? Cuz that is pretty much how you made Divinity 2, at least on Tactian Difficulty.  Also, almost all of the ""Boss"" fights are so rigged they are killing any enjoyment of playing the game for me. I am talking about the Hanag fight where she opens a bunch of void portals and my physical DMG party has no way of closing them so the only way through is a 4 vs 20 fight. The Gwydian Rince fight at the blackpits where the only known way to fight against 3 magisters and 20 voidwoken is to abuse a flaw in the game (such as teleporting the idiot into a tent and body blocking his way out and even then he manages to friendly fire my team with his stupid lightning bolts actually causing more DMG to me than the enemy) otherwise he will literally suicide by running through fire for a mile to ♥♥♥♥♥ slap an oil blob. Or the Alice Alicseon fight where she literally 1 hits my entire party on her first move... In the end I defeated all of them but I get no enjoyment whatsoever from having to restart a dozen times every fight until finally abusing a flaw... I have read that a lot of people struggle with these fights even on the easiest difficulty and what do the devs do? Nothing therefore personally I am never purchasing another game made by this studio ever again."

Ulgorash,254,3,0,"October 15, 2017",Not Recommended,22.2,"So first of all, as a disclaimer, I haven't played the previous game. Also, I do love turn-based combat. But combat is what eventually will let me drop the game after about 20 hrs into it.  Two major issues I have with this game:  1. Side-quests are pretty much not optional. If you don't do every side-quest you can find and if you don't spend time fine-combing the environment for gear and XP (which takes considerable time), you will fail at the inevitable boss battles because you are underpowered. You can compensate a bit with clever use of skills and the environment, but at the end, you need to squeeze every bit out of the area you are currently in. In an RPG, I want to be an explorer and not an (XP) vacuum cleaner.  2. A lot of trial and error, especially in boss battles. For me, an RPG is supposed to tell a story. Battles should be challenging and give you a sense of reward and progression, but this should not rely on the players to trial and error through a fight, ideally with repeated dialogue that cannot be skipped. Throw in friendly NPCs with the AI of a rotten tomato that add an additional random factor to each fights progress and you end up with a time sink of enormous proportions.  There were other minor faults, like targeting in fights that could be overlooked, due to the interesting story and the engaging setting but sadly, I don't have the time to play Alexandar or Lady Vengeance fights over and over again until the stars of (friendly and hostile) NPC align in a way that the battle is won.  A lot of potential wasted, which is sad."

As my money was gone, the next day I tried to play again, tried to discover what others had found so interesting, but I couldn't.  So the things that I didn't like about it.  This is a slow paced game with little fighting.  More an adventure game than the ""RPG"" style that I'm used to. It's complicated.  Potentially very.  Yet it makes no effort to introduce you to the mechanics at all.  Just dumps you in the deep end with just a few pop up tips. Fighting is equally complex and equally badly explained.  So is character setup. It's very hard.  Almost everything kills you whilst you wonder what on earth you should be doing. You have to manually adjust the camera using the middle mouse button all the time. And more.  I have a feeling that this is meant for people that played the first game and know how it works.

However, it has one really big flaw: Tactician mode.  I enjoy a challenge, so when I saw the description of Tactician mode I figured it would be for me. I spent most of the weekend playing and kept running into fights in which enemies were doing the most crazy♥♥♥♥♥♥ A lot of times I was simply reloading and reloading and reloading; Avoiding most fights until I did every possible sidequest to give me enough strength to get through the fights by the skin of my teeth.  I figured I was doing something wrong, but after some Googling, it turns out there's not much that can be done: Tactician mode gives a flat 50% increase to Armour, Health and Damage of enemies and has simply not been playtested all that well. I'm currently in doubt whether to restart in Classic or not. That's a lot of hours I need to redo and I don't think I can be arsed."

Fought the voidwoken at the city gate with a character with 3000 life 1500 arnour and 1000 magic, lasted a grand total of two combat rounds.

Scary,153,2,3,February 18,Not Recommended,13.1,"This game really falls short of what I was hoping it would deliver. It promises oldschool creativity, but only captures the frustration of having a poorly developed combat system. While the combat system becomes more intuitive as the session goes on, I don't think the fact that it becomes bareable after a lengthly attempt at the game should justify the system.   Graphics and voice acting are on point and the art style will make you wish that the actual game portion of the video game was more fun."
buchecker,359,2,1,"October 27, 2017",Not Recommended,47.0,"Edit: Its funny how a significant portion of the fanbase seems to have so little self esteem that they have to downvote every single negative review, because it seems to threaten them.  A community that cant tell the difference between ""I disagree"" and ""Not helpful"" and confuses ""Difficulty"" with ""♥♥♥♥♥♥ balance"". Also expect ""Git Guds"" and ""Just play on easy"" on the forums if you ever dare to ask for help (not that the game has any tactical difficulty once you memorized the fights).   Biggest disappointment since Dragon Commander. The game feels difficult at first (especially on Tactician) until one learns the tricks of the gimmicky battle system. Foreknowledge(like pre placing barrels and characters) and broken skill combos (lets not even start about the OP brokenness of Thievery in the beginning or the outright game breaking op-ness of telekinesis) in combination with a lack of a real learning phase (other than restarting the game over and over) makes this very frustrating in the beginning (also lets not talk about the save scumming required to not having to spend hours on vendor refreshes or sticking with♥♥♥♥♥♥gear).  A couple posts from the forum that i mostly agree with:  https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682611432375/?ctp=4#c1488861734093980210 https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682611432375/?ctp=3#c3223871682612135634 https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682615762993/#c3223871682615798995 https://steamcommunity.com/app/435150/discussions/0/3223871682615762993/#c3223871682615813182  There is also only the illusion of freedom, while the game is on rails (like the first one). NPC reactions may feel clever and alive but its all show and scripted. Best example of that is an NPC you can have a flirt with who will then fight on your side, unless you trigger the fight the wrong way and i cant even talk to said NPC once hostile, because the scripts dont account for that. I think this is the biggest issue with DoS2, it thinks its so clever, while it really isnt.  P.S.: Also the armor system is the worst i have seen in an RPG so far."

This game does have some good aspects to it, the Origin characters and their individual stories are interesting enough. You are not bound to a specific class, giving you greater build freedom than in most other RPG's. The game is far from linear. And you can either kill anybody you want.. or be their errand boy/girl.   Recommend vs not recommend is not really fair.. I am not condemning the game.

I tried the rogue / assassin class and spent the 1st 8 hours of the game with a butter knife for a weapon and a bucket on my head for armor. the interaction with npcs takes way too long, sometimes you have to talk to them for 10 min then memorize everything they said cuz you need all the information for a quest on the other side of the map.   the combat is way too slow and a little more complicated than it should be. ok so im 4th in line to get to do my attacks, i got slowed from 1 of the 5 enemies my team is fighting. so move 3 spaces and buff myself thats the end of my turn. 10 min later my turn comes back around but because i got knocked down i get to spend my whole turn standing up. 10 min later again i move 3 spaces and poke someone with my butter knife, who just heals it back anyway.   each char has something called source which grants a special ability, problem is its never around when you need it and most of the time is worthless in a fight.   so if you like to spend hours running around talking to npcs, and 30 min of combat to kill 3 turtles with a butter knife this is the game for you. or you could just play final fantasy whatever one cuz its 15x better."

However I have rage quit OS2 on a number of occasions due to poor game design.  You will frequently come across enemies much more powerful than you than will kill you instantly.  There is a set path you are meant to take but it is easy to go off track and suffer.  Bosses are designed outside of the game restrictions imposed on you (you have 4 AP's) they can get 10 and cast spells every turn when you have a cool down to contend with.  Even battles with enemies your own level can be very difficult because the game designers were too lazy to to offer a balanced game.    Constantly being caught by surprise because the enemy can break core game mechanics isn't fun.  The trap detection is pointless - it goes like - I've spotted a trap - BOOM.  You have no time to react to the announcement and the characters walk straight into the traps even though spotted.  The teleportation pyramids, so integral in the first game, are pointless here.  I have used them twice, I think, as the 'puzzles' can be brute forced.  Very disappointed."

The game tells you very little, both in terms of story and history of the series, and in terms of gameplay. Pretty much all of the enemies  have the exact same abilities as you, which fails to make your character feel special or unique.  The traditional text box format of dialog is really ineffecient and really fails to convey emotions or actions well. There's a reason games nowadays have moved away from that. And the aesthetics are just way too gaudy, clashing, or just nonsensical. And the combat is very difficult, even on the lower difficulties, explains very little, and makes very little sense. At the very least, the party members are interesting, that's maybe the one thing that made me actually continue playing the game.

pikkukalsari,886,1,1,June 21,Not Recommended,2.4,"My wife played this game via family sharing and this was her judgement:  I'm not a gaming expert but everyone has a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and an opinion. Here's mine: Beautiful game with a lot of potential for modders. Most of the game I was annoyed and waited when the fun part starts and it never did. Story and it's ending was not interesting, Lohse was the only one that made me emotional (mostly because of the song), everything else was somewhat basic and hollow. It was just my own expectations but I waited there to be good humor like in D:OS 1. There was nothing funny in this game, lots of intestines and exploded monsters on the streets at the end and no one even joked about the ""gore"".   Spirit vision should be 'on' most of the time or you'll miss a lot of information, even necessary. Crafting was dull,♥♥♥♥♥♥loads of material but nothing else useful but scrolls and basic potions to do. Runes that enhance your armor/weapons can be placed only to some specific pieces and that pretty much settles what you are going to wear. Also most of the usefull or even moderately powerfull stuff to craft is available just in the last chapter because of drops, and it would not have been OP to have them earlier since the crucial drops are rare anyway.   Combat was boring and annoying and the best way (sometimes the only way) was to cheese the battle, even at the normal difficulty. Doesn't really make you feel that you ""git gud"". Also it became obvious very fast that when you see 4 enemies in the area, there will be at least 8 of them in the battle EVERYTIME.   I hated the physical+magical armor pools logic; if enemy has even 1 point of phys armor left, ie. knock down automatically fails and when there is none, it always succeeds, that system felt ""cheap"". Some sidequest lines seemed unfinished and left holes to the story (of course they were the ones that were interesting IMO). Skills felt very much the same no matter what skill line it was from; same♥♥♥♥♥♥in different package.   I think the biggest problem all in all was that there was too much of everything and nothing was made well enough, like an unfortunate compromise. I guess it's good/ok for most of the people but I'm not gonna play it again, in comparison D:OS 1 is now third time under completion. But hey! Graphics were fantastic, GUI's were good and clear and character build somewhat entertaining."
The Hellspawn Hero,103,4,4,October 31,Not Recommended,5.5,"This game is so slow-paced by the time I completed the tutorial, it was too late to get a refund. Exploration, combat, leveling up, dialogue, using the UI, and even syncing the game's data to cloud all take so long that it feels like the game was designed to waste as much time as possible. Movement in particular is so pointlessly slow that travelling from one objective to another can take upwards of three minutes when both objectives are placed in the same room. Combat comes off as more luck-based than tactical, due to a combination of poor controls causing you to accidentally make a move you didn't mean to (which, of course, you cannot undo), and enemies simply being given unfair advantages. Even if sluggish pacing, clunky controls and cheating enemies are the norm in CRPGs, exaggerating these traits probably isn't going to enhance the experience for most players. (Especially ones like me, who are trying to give the genre a chance, but keep finding it more frustrating than fun.)  I can only recommend it if you're very, very patient and already know ahead of time that you're certain that you'll enjoy it."

Paddy Mayne,85,3,2,April 26,Not Recommended,126.0,"Don't be beguiled by the large number of positive reviews! While there is a lot to admire about the size, content and look of the game the fundimentals are a mess and ridiculously unbalanced against the player. Forget thinking you have found a great new piece of armor or a splendid weapon that's perfect for you character, before long at least by the next level up it will be a vulnerability, stats too low yet barely worth selling. Every fight you are the underdog. Enemies, be they simple slugs to ghastly demons are vastly more powerful than you. It gets worse and worse as you move through the game as there is little consistency (in scale or the self contained universe) to the abilities and stats of enemy groups. There are few chances to adapt or plan unless you save every 10 seconds and replay every encounter over and over until maybe on some occasions you get a break. More and more its a case of flee or reload and avoid. My last encounter before I quit and wrote this review in utter frustration 2 of my party died in the first attack before I even got to have a turn. <Update just had a ONE hit party wipe out by goodness! ...whhhhaaaattt!> A fair and full review would need to be vastly longer than any here allows but in my personal opinion have now tried DOS 1 and 2 you best be aware its NOT D&D, its not Baulders Gate or Neverwinter or anything like.  You will quickly wonder why its goes from slow and ponderous especially in the first chapters of both games, to frequent gob-smacked rage in frustration at the perfidious onesided, almost solely armor based combat.  For a confused narrative very partially about stopping the use of magic its ironic even a slug knows more ridiculously wide-ranging spells than your party.  Occasionally my wannabe 'Gods' seemed to have powers to match their status. They could sometimes fight on an 'near' even basis, their stats miracoulsly creeping up to 'HALF' their opponents and given my careful planning and assessment. But then that was when I back-tracked to areas long by-passed or completed narrative-wise.   My advice: Only buy at a huge mark down, like 70%, or if you are a pedantic soul who spends hours studying stats and comparisions by your own work or using the (for this game) poor wikis and on line sources. Thats just me and I am in a minority.  Just try to be aware of what you are in for, the out pourings of admiration are I believe a product as much about the general state of PC gaming. I have bought it and will try hard to enjoy and play as much as I can, I don't like to waste money after all. It can be enjoyable and interesting and engaging but would I get my money back if I could ?... yes for both Divinity OS 1 and 2 and I wouldn't lie awake regretting it.  I am not a big fan of games that require you very often to leave the immersion to seek outside help with beating a game. To have work out what deals with a particular fundimental game mechanic with rarely any in game hints or advice sources.  Dragon's Dogma Dark Arisen was an exception I enjoyed despite that.  DOS2 though I haven't bothered researching help much, it just doesn't seem worth the bother."

Thus summing up my first two hours, and only two hours in game.  Divinity 2 is a shinier old school RPG, that suffers from awful mechanics, and relying on save scumming. There is nothing to do when running into a problem besides loading an old save.

Edit: Picked it up again because I was bored and wanted a good RPG. I have 130 hours in this game, got near the end of the game, and, for some reason, only then realized that everything past the first map of the game, Fort Joy, was a waste of time. My main gripes would be:  -The initiation mechanic which killed any sense of balance within the already mediocre combat system -Zero roleplayability  -Story is poorly explained and executed. I tried caring about the plot early on, I really did, but it was just such a trainwreck of unexplained fanfic.net material that I stopped caring about quarter way through the game  -Massive railroading -A complete lack of space to roam around and do as you please, see above -The camera angles are worked in a way which made me constantly turn my neck to try and get a better look at what was happening. Never experienced this from any other videogame. -The suddenness of the lewd scenes compared to just how little romance actually takes place before them. Felt awkward and abrupt, but this could be due to the lack of interaction between party characters, which leads me to: -Lack of likeable characters. This is pretty big in a role-playing game, where gameplay is usually supposed to take a hit in order to allow more resources to be put onto branching paths of the story, characters, making everything else an enjoyable experience, etc. I only liked one of the six characters and later grew to like two others, but even then they had so few lines and barely reacted to the story that I felt like they weren't really there.  -Enemies often get massive advantages, both in numbers and quality, and near-always get to have their strongest character move first combat regardless if you attacked them first out of combat or not -Still fraught with glitches despite being out for several years now, had to keep restarting the game due to my turns being skipped.  -Has the worst quest journal in any game I've seen: ignore it completely and use Google -Large difficulty spikes are common  A few good things about the game though: +Tig o' dwarf bitties +You get a randumb squirrel riding a cat companion that sometimes gives you stuff +The plot actually got me really excited one time for about three hours +There's a lot of content if you're willing to put up with all the negatives. +You can be a skeleton  +You can bang elves +You can genocide elves  +Lizard babes +You can genocide elves  3/10 would not recommend, if you really want it then get some friend to buy it for you during steam sales for a quarter or something, idk, go read a book or something"

The Edge of the Map,134,3,1,July 1,Not Recommended,32.7,"Don't get me wrong the game is not bad and I'm not desperate for my money back. However, I can't reccomend this game when there are alternatives much cheaper and about the same quality,   First off it's very difficult for a new player. The game punishes you hard for things you couldn't be expected to know. For example there's an item you need to pick up right at the begining which is really easy to miss. I restarted 3 times and missed it every time. I only found out about it later when reading a guide.  Most importantly is the combat system. There's a lot of variety of things you can do. The big problem is the armor system. It makes having a mixed party of magic and physical damage much harder than having all physical or all magical. The fights are really hard. The enemies don't seem to scale very well but as soon as you get to the next level they become extremely easy. For example the first boss I spent 3 hours trying to beat at level 3, he was able to one shot my characters. I gave up, left and came back as soon as I hit level 4 and did it first time, easily. As I progressed the fights again became unwinnable to the point that I had to lower the difficulty level, something I never do. With the difficulty level changed the fights were then all far too easy. So the difficulty is either near impossible or no challenge at all.  If I could get a refund I would choose to take it but I'm not desperate. The game isn't bad but it's nowhere near the amount of hype it has got. I haven enjoyed it less than Dragon Age origins which is much cheaper."

The story seems interesting, although I don’t really like any of the characters. But still, this seems to be the one positive thing about this game. Why can I have only 4 characters? Even if everything else were perfect, this would make me dislike the game. Now regarding tactics, I don’t want to get into details. The two kinds of shields are really strange. I have no idea what the different classes mean, what kind of classes my companions should be, and combat is generally too hard. So all in all the game is not fun. A shame, I wanted to like it. "

You cannot travel freely and easily as most paths blocked by excess rocky outcrops, rivers and other obstacles, made worse by tall trees.  Forever having to 'mouse' around the views to see a way forward which is never easy.  Very frustrating.  And difficulty on easiest setting is ridiculously hard.  All the enemies have a full spellkit and you  are easily overwhelmed by numbers and abilities.  No good cheats either.  Give us the old ~ option for some cheats, otherwise way too hard and frustrating to move around with obstacles.  Fires, bombs, posions, traps - not fun."

Bugs like completed quest flags not disappearing from map, vacant sections of the map that just see you walking from one part of the world to the other, and theaimlessness with often obscure info to work from. Conversley I love the combat, in particular the two types of armor which add to the drama.  It's challenging and really makes a difference.  There is no such thing as an easy fight. I just feel when you compare to Bioware games of the past we seem to set the bar so much lower on RPG's concerning story and immersion. BG2 is a better game than this and it was released more than 15 years ago. But on the whole it's good... but probably not $40 good. "

Joeymtl,104,No,0,June 25,Not Recommended,12.1,"The difference in difficulty between Explorer (easy) and Classic (normal) is enormous. Classic feels way too hard to be fun, even when fully equipped at the right level (you will be forced into an optimal party composition and reload quicksaves constantly), and Explorer feels way too easy, offering absolutely no challenge.  In combat, the AI doesn't seem to care at all about their peers, and often throw AoE damage on everyone, making melee combat frustrating since their damage output and number are simply higher and you'll die before they do.  It's a shame because the story seems deep and entertaining. :("

merusalem,185,No,0,"October 17, 2017",Not Recommended,25.8,"This is one of the games where I had wished a Neutral vote option were available on Steam. I do not think it is a bad game, but it is definitely not for me. I forced myself to continue playing it twice, as I wanted to give it a chance.  By all means, buy the game, if you like Baldur's Gate style games.  If not, stay away from Divinity: Original Sin 2 - I know I should have. Or take a look at it, and make sure you stay clearly below two hours played. I clocked a few minutes more than two hours, because of the save game problems (I kept trying to figure out what went wrong), and was refused a refund by Steam.  My gaming background for RPGs:  Longtime (A)D&D player, plus most other systems that were published since the eighties.     I loved Baldur's Gate in 1998.     I found most of the games with Baldur's-Gate-like gameplay pretty lackluster after 1998. Maybe it was me getting older, that is possible.     Sacrilege upcoming: I found the earlier Divinity games pretty boring.     The glowing reviews made me buy the game, although I suspected I might not like it because of its technical side. Positive:   The music was not distracting me from the game.     Somewhat nice graphics.     Some hilarious conversations.     Some over-the-top characters.     You can build the skills of your characters largely as you want. Dream of a dual-wielding backstabbing mage who summons a creature? Done. (Not saying this character would be effective in fights, but you can do it.)      Nice progression of items my group of characters - umm - found.     I have seen way worse item and hotbar management in other games. Neutral:  Some good voice acting, some bad voice directing. I.e. in some cases it is obvious that the actors did not have the faintest idea why their character would say such a thing.     The main story did not grip me. I have seen worse, but I found Dragon Age: Origins' story both more personal and more threatening. Even considering that the characters' fate is similar to Origins' mages. Negative:  The same problem as other games using this perspective: You are constantly spinning the view, as otherwise you do not see the environment you are walking into.. It is worse here, though, as we are not talking about just walls, we are talking about high walls and giant cliffs. While there is a bit of transparency when you stand under one of these huge obstacles, it is more of a circle of three feet around a character. Meaning, while you can see the character, you have no idea what is around him. Until you spin and tip the landscape. Again, and again.     Deciding who of your group should speak with an NPC can already fail a quest. It is not that automatically the PC with the best speaking ability, or the PC who would appear most friendly to the NPC is auto-selected. So, when an NPC who fears humans / elves / whatever is spoken to, and you are unlucky, you fail the quest already by just saying hello.     You have to talk with each and every NPC on the map, as you do not have the faintest idea what will progress your quests. And many of them have nothing much to say.     If you mis-click during a level-up, you have just lost a point. There is no ""oops, I did not mean that"" button.     Clicking on NPCs outside of combat is a mini-game, which I did not find very amusing. You hunt for the moving pixels on the screen, and when you click you find that they already moved again, and had stood in fromt of some object. This object is marked as stealable, so they assume you are going to steal it. Just because you hunted them down with your mouse cursor, to talk to them.     Problems with loading save games: (Known bug) The game can get into a state where no save games can be loaded, and all you see are error messages. Restarting the game does not always help, in some cases restarting Windows is necessary. If not for this bug, I would have refunded the game, so: Well played, Larian! :) "

alextwotu,22,No,0,February 12,Not Recommended,16.0,"Divinity: original Sin 2 has a good combat system, skills, and graphics, but their are some major reasons that prevent me from enjoying this game. I thought I would like this because I enjoyed xcom 2, but boy was I wrong.  One reason was the fact that monsters do not respawn (so their is a finite xp) which leads my characters being underleveled. I don't really enjoy doing side quests, but it seems you would be under leveled without doing them. This really breaks the immersion and makes the story extremely linear.   There are also quite a few skill imbalances in the game. For example, if you do not take the talking animal perk you will be missing out on tons of quests. The game seems to force you to make certain choices, which means there really isn't a choice in the first place.  I also found the death system annoying..  Overall, this game had some very unique features, but surprisingly these unique features are the reasons I dislike the game. This game seems to be catered to very specific group as opposed to what you might think when reading other reviews. I had never played a game that has finite xp and probably will never again."

Rage,140,2,1,September 9,Not Recommended,83.9,"This review is for the Classic version of Divinity: Original Sin 2. There is a new version of this game call Definitive Edition was released while I was still working my way through the Classic version.  The two versions aren’t compatible and I can't comment on the new version.  Divinity is a somewhat open world 3d isometric turn-based RPG. Think sort of Dungeons and Dragons with a different system. You create a character with certain classes and attributes and off you go!  The game gets a lot of things right.  A relatively decent story, great characters, fantastic voice acting, and lots of places to explore. There is so much charm to this game and so many things that I want to like...  However, all of this is really overshadowed by some other terrible things.  The first is that you never really know where to go. You spend considerable time simply bumbling around the world. The way the world is set up if you go into the wrong areas at the wrong time you will get absolutely beat down without mercy. There’s no way really to tell if you can do a mission except to the area and see the level of the enemies and if they are too high you know you are in the wrong place. There are also some areas where you have no idea where to go and just wander around aimlessly. This kind of stuff I call “wasting the players time”.   No wonder I’ve seen people say it takes 100 hours to complete a play-through, you spend a considerable chunk of it lost! The older I get the less tolerance I have for this kind of mechanic.  I just want to get through the game in a reasonable amount of time, and the game is already pretty long.  The second is the fact the game is so dang hard. I played on normal and I never rage quite a game as many times as I did this game. The disparage between your party and a group of enemies on +1 levels or even levels is astonishing. Many fights feel like the hardest fight ever. Even with the best gear I can find or buy my squad feels constantly outmatched. Fights can often come down to simple opening positioning and which side gets the best initiation. Nothing like the enemy getting a great initiation with big spells into a 3-4 man 2 turn fear that leads into an easy team wipe. It’s rage inducing and it happens a lot.  You feel you need to constantly quick-save because you’re afraid you’re going to walk into something and get 1000% wrecked at literally any moment because it constantly happens. To me, it’s super un-fun, but maybe if you are into that kind of thing this is up your alley. I’ve given up after 80 hours and will never finish the game.  TLDR;  A solid RPG that is marred by bad mechanics and crazy difficulty. You’ll love parts of it, then question your sanity, then rage quit, then makeup excuses why you should continue playing and eventually give up and curl into a ball and cry."

I waited for months till the enhanced edition came, i was happy to play it on the couch and enjoy the wonderful world Larian studios created, they really did.

You should try it if you in that kind of games and if it starts crashing every 20 minutes, request a refund.  The crash is game releated. The popup appears to sent a bug report to the developer and i'm back to win10."
FUNKY BEATS,115,36,9,"September 15, 2017",Not Recommended,78.4,"Game has tons of issues. To start, combat. It makes me want to strangle the early access players for not bringing up such blatant problems. Almost all enemies in the game have nearly twice as much movement as you do, forcing you to constantly scramble around in fights, and never having the upper hand. Because of this, positioning becomes worthless. Trying to bottleneck or choke off enemies doesn't work either, because they'll walk straight through a blazing fire up to your backline and annihilate them. Then you can only run back 10ft, while they can run 20ft, and still attack twice. Enemy missiles tend to ignore solid objects completely, screwing your position. They also have twice as much range as your characters do, giving them multiple rounds of free hits off. Sometimes you'll both be on even ground, staring right at each other, with the same weapon, but the enemy can fire over objects while you can't because 'line of sight obscured.' Enemies also tend to hit much higher, despite being the same level as you, with only minor equipment differences.  Abilities are too weak to even merit use. You can hold two wands with poison/fire, and spam the auto attack, which will poison then explode the area around the enemy, as opposed to spending twice as many skillpoints throwing oil on them then fire. The only good skills are ones that involve movement, like teleportation, because as previously stated the positioning in this game is god awful, and having a spell that lets you immediately reposition is broken.  On top of that, the armor system is atrocious. The devs claimed that diversity is key, but what they really meant is that everyone in your party has to be hybrid otherwise you're ♥♥♥♥ed. And it only gets worse and worse, until basic enemies are just bloated sponges with upwards of 2-3 THOUSAND armor. And this time around, armor denies everything but flat damage and blinds, so basically your CC is worthless until you spend 3 rounds busting their armor. 99% of situations are better off being handled just by dogpiling and blowing all your damage abilities at once, hoping to burst the enemy down.   Drop system is bad too. You could spend 15 minutes fighting higher leveled enemies, carefully planning and strategizing, only to be rewarded with scraps of wood. Despite the fact that they are wearing nice looking plate armor and carried shiny, big weapons. Avoiding conflict is a better choice almost always, because rewards from actually killing enemies are non existent.    And finally, the RPG system, the biggest draw of the game, is horrendous. You have two options. Play like a nice guy ♥♥♥♥♥, or fight 10 people at once. Standing up for yourself or trying to be heroic is always met with getting gang banged. 90% of the time, dialogue will always lead to the exact same ending, no matter which choices you make. It might come to that ending through different means, but it never feels like you actually influenced anything.   tl;dr, the game fails in both aspects of what it was meant to be. DO NOT BUY until it has been patched, re patched, and then sewn back together. I foresee many refunds in the near future."
Rooba,313,4,1,"September 28, 2017",Not Recommended,95.5,"It's interesting, long, packed with turn-based combat and a lot of dialogs and hidden stuff you have to explore. Now, when we are done with typical overhyped idiomas, let's talk facts.  This game sucks, especially when compared to the first Original Sin.  Unfair: you play as a living skeleton, but you're not immune to bleeding, though similar skeletal enemies are; should you take Glass Cannon as your talent - you'll be the #1 target for all enemies' status effect skills; your enemies ALWAYS have WAY more AP than you do.  Weaker: this game is missing personality system that was there in the first Original Sin. Your characters talk to each other after some things happened, but all for nothing. New physical and magic armor system is plainly stupid.  Diablo 3: remember your tank had 3k HP in the first game and it was awesome? Now you need more then 10k to survive barely, or even more. Waiting for 330.3M damage numbers to show up. This is followed by a simple problem - items of level 19 are significantly weaker than items of level 20, for example, and mind the cost in gold.  Co-op is broken: some aspects of the game are ridiculously broken in co-op, like NPC getting stuck in dialogs, fights, where you skip the first turn because or something etc.  Bugs: a lot of them. The farther you get the more broken it gets. Looks like someone got quite a rough night trying to finish the game faster than possible.  Too damn long: game does not show nothing new to you. We played 80 hours and it's still the same broken game. You just get tired of it at some point, as it gets boring as hell.  To sum up. I love Original Sin 1, I tried to love Original Sin 2, look at my playtime. Me and my friends struggled a lot to go through and see the ending, but looks like it's impossible. Shame on you, Larian."

I saw huge existing worlds. so much ways to trick the other players. there was no end to the possibilites... everything staged.  Now you have linear layers of maps. The same story. non of my friends and me were able to play it for a 2nd time because the replayvalue of the game is non existant. nearly no encounter matters. its always the same. your goal and way is the same (not like they showed in the past).  My first playthrough was amazing. All great thats left now is the amazing fight system.  Nothing is random generated. One playthrough and then never again.  It would be soooo awesome if there  would be an open game mode. throw in the great fightsystem. a nemesis system for different parties like the magisters or black ring. let them affect the world. then fight them, shape the world with a smart AI system that plays against you. random encounters guranteed. it adds some great survival and endless fighting encounters over time. getting strong. rewarding. and then imagine they realy put in their acted and staged randomized goals for each player in it which they showed in the past, what could have been.

If you're planning on playing co-op I don't think you're going to enjoy It very much with the ridiculous loading time. It increases and grows as you play with friends, It's absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥ing stupid to sit through a 5-20 minute loading screen everytime you want to reload a save.  Let's say you make a mistake, your whole party dies and you'd obviously want to reload to a previous save where you can reposition yourself better to win the fight, load a savefile wait like 20 minutes for you and your buddy to load in and play.  This in my opinion makes multiplayer/co-op no longer fun, loading times shouldn't be this long just to play a game together.  Oh and not to mention there's alot of missing voice lines, images, and misspelt dialouges, I've screenshotted a few which proves it, I don't understand how Larian Studios can release this and say It's out of early access, while there's a ton of missing features as mentioned earlier.  If you plan to play this game solo and you don't mind a few missing features then go right ahead, you won't have much of a problem.  But If you plan to play this game with a friend, expect long loading times that will increase over time, I wouldn't recommend this until they fix the loading times.  In my opinion this game still feels like It's in early access, give Larian Studios some time before purchasing.  Overall I think this game is amazing and way better than the first Divinity: Original Sin, don't get me wrong but the only thing that puts me off Is the loading times.

levantez,96,3,1,"September 22, 2017",Not Recommended,37.1,"First, let me say before hand that this is a really great game.  The Narratives and Strategy are simply superb. And the Combat being among the best Games that I've ever played.  However, it has several design flaws and bugs that really bugged me and ruined my experiences. I'm going to give this a negative review until some of them get solved.  - It's too hard to keep track of ongoing Quests. During exploration, I would encountered some Quest specific Events, without knowing that I did. Leading me to do things that I should not have done, result in the quest became close and unsolvable. Displaying a warning beforehand could really help. I know that it's Player driven narrative, but I prefer to have my quests solved.  - Shovel in Fort Joy. Even if there was a hint, I couldn't find it. And I didn't want to bring the Dragons along just to dig things.  - Trial & Errors Dialog result There was really little hints in the dialog that could show how the result will end up, making me do Save&Load again&again just so that I can clear those quests. In this kind of game, the results can be swayed by the traits of your characters. Thus, how the Players develop their characters became a fun part of it. But in this game, additional choices from traits do not guaranteed benefits. As such, I do not feel that traits are fun to play with. Please reference Shadow Run on this.  - Map & Key Object Display It took me too much time just to clear Fort Joy, with more than half the time spending on finding that exact thing to do in order to progress. I went pass both the drawbridge lever and the fort tunnel, because I didn't realize they are there. And then end up slaughtered the entire Fort before I could progress on.  - Bug - Not everyone in the party Entered Combat If a Party Member entered combat or flee, please teleport everyone in,  instead of having to make me select and manually move them one by one.  - Bug - Party Members don't follow Player This occurred sometimes. Party Members will just stand still and didn't follow. Coupled with the above bug really ruined it."

jmp3000,68,1,0,"October 19, 2017",Not Recommended,7.1,"There's a lot to it and I really want to like it. However there's a long list of complaints that make me not able to reccomend this.   First, the enemy always gets to go first and is always in range of your weakest character(s), the battle order needs work, there's no helpful explanations on how to play or starter equpiment and everything is too expensive at the beggining so you just have crap equipment and spells for a long time, it's extremely easy to have friendly fire as almost all of your AoE attacks will hurt your party (along with the status effects that continue for another 2+ turns and your characters will run through or stand in fire or poison, etc. which does damage overtime inside and outside of combat which also restarts status effects), the game can be buggy with character lines missing or no voice actor, the enemy uses almost nothing but AoE attacks so that by round 2-3 your whole party has half or less health, quests can be difficult to track, the save system spams save slots so you'll have about 10 or more everytime you play (which isn't that bad but it's annoying), it's unclear where your party members go when they are dismissed as they just leave somewhere and don't go to the party management menu so you can't switch characters out easily, and party formations aren't very helpful for avoiding AoE attacks as you're always close to the enemy and your characters can't/don't spread out that much.   Some cool things though are that the quests can be interesting, there's a lot of dialouge & characters, customizing your character can be fun, though it's very limited at the beginning and it's a rpg.  Overall it's more frusterating than difficult, and that's what made it not fun for me.

This gets worse and worse as the game goes on.  Storyline is really unengaging. Characters are unlikable all around.  I'm very close to the end and I don't think I'm going to finish.

Zeldenhandel,51,1,2,"December 24, 2017",Not Recommended,83.0,"I stopped playing the game about halfway through it, I think. I got to three source and finished most of the quests on Reaper's Coast.  I really wanted to like this game. I liked the premise. I like some of the mechanics. But combats quickly become tedious affairs that you just want to get through. And even on Explorer mode they're still pretty hard. And then there's the bad game design. One of my biggest annoyances with the game design, is that npc's don't stop when you try to talk to them, which in one occasion meant that I clicked an npc, went to the toilet and put away my laundry, came back and I STILL wasn't talking to her.  Another annoyance is the bugs in the game. Saves that get corrupted. PC's that disappear out of combat. Enemies that you can't reach and that can't reach you, leaving you stuck in combat (luckily you can run away from the combat). Enemies that get full health again for no reason. PC's that die for no reason.  The first Divinity: Original Sin had great gameplay, but the story for me was broken at the point that you travel through the portal from interesting murder investigation into ""meta-cosmic universe in the balance"" quest, that you then leave behind again, because you still have to solve that murder... This game has an interesting story, but has managed to ruin the cool gameplay elements from the first game."

The Mish,81,19,0,"March 14, 2017",Not Recommended,145.4,"As a first impression of the game I'd say that the previous game was much more user friendly, and probably worth your money until they work on this game. There are a lot of issues with early level encounters being too based on enemy moves to really be ""fun."" Some classes seem virtually unsable at the beginning of the game, for example if you choose wizard and take the fire spells you are recommended to choose you are essentially useless in most early encounter as enemies are 100% resistant to fire damage and plague damage actually heal enemies (a mechanic carried over from the original, but not implemented until a character has enough economy or experience to buy different types of wands for different situations). 3 hours into the game and I have only gotten plague wands which makes me feel useless in undead encounters or a certain set of slugs. Also, the campaign is very ambigious as to what you're supposed to do, and with the dialogue not being voiced reading endless text for hints that you cannot access after exiting paces the game very slowly.  I love D:OS, but I urge fans of the series to exhaust the first game prior to buying this one. While the multiplayer allowing you to play with three friends instead of one is a huge selling point, I would still heavily recommend the first game. 4/10 currently atleast as a first impression. Potential to be as great as the first D:OS which I believe is a terrific game. Currently, not worth the 45$ in my opinion."

That is until I reached the Reaper's Coast. The difficulty spike is ♥♥♥♥ing massive. I'm not talking about a little, I mean almost everywhere is a giant boss monster that can literally one shot your team with ease. The only method of killing them is to cheese them like throwing dozens of fire bombs to prevent regeneration, talking to them, then teleporting them to an extremely overpowered friendly NPC, survive waves of enemies so the portals finally dissapear while a character literally pours instant KO lava onto your characters, or somehow killing 6 wolves that give the already massive enemy a buff that increases almost every stat on almost every turn they get.   I grinded, and grinded, and grinded. I rebuilt my characters, I even got better gear, but these fights only introduce rage. As a Lone Wolf character, all these fights were impossible, since I could only have a max of two characters, including my own. I've gone through this game thus far using my wits, and patience.

Just Lewis,294,No,0,October 19,Not Recommended,24.6,"This game is far too difficult to enjoy. I have played the game where we did well, forgot to save, had to replay doing all the same things and ended up doing terribly. This game feels like an RNG sim with no stratergy applicable. You can face the same thing with the same odds and constantly end up with different results. If I liked real llife gambling, maybe I would like this game.  It's hard to come back to, it's hard to enjoy in the first place, it's hard to get better at.. I just, don't get why this has such high ratings.   Okay enough critisising without any actual evidence to back up my opinions. Here is some in depth critisising.  I don't know about you, but I seem to fall into the same ""do gooder"" attitude when I'm playing RPGs and I've started this game from scratch a few times and every time I've restarted; it's completely different. The battles change dramatically, but the story does not. Like magic I guess. The story changes depending on the way you answer questions sure; but the experience in gameplay, battling and whatever doesn't change. No matter what; the battles will either be in your favour or not. When the battles are not in your favour, they suck; reload and try again because they will change dramatically. it's seriously random and seeing as you can basically control the world by saving and reloading, do it and keep doing it because it's the only way to progress. Otherwise YOU ARE LITERALLY GOING TO START THE GAME OVER THINKING THINGS WILL BE DIFFERENT. The hardest battles can be beaten by this method and that's the reason the level scaling is so high. 1 level lower than you're oponent? The odd's are NOT in your favour, 1 level higher? The odds are. The thing is that if you want to challenge yourself and fight a higher level opponent, the only reason you will win is out of luck, not skill. This is not a skill or stratergy based game and by using stratergy I have failed numerous times. For a strategic player, it isn't fun. It's a gamble every time no matter what I do and the cost always feels far too high. Fighting lower level enemies is the only way to progress without having to reload and redo..... (which I have done far too much)  It took me far too long to figure this out so I'm posting this for the people that enjoy a real challenge; not a fake one. Fake challenges suck and aren't fun. Make a challenge that is actually satisfying to overcome and you have a good start to a game, people look forward to the next challenge. This battle system sucks. It sucks because it is so random and so unforginving. Real life isn't like this. In real life, You try harder to beat the things you think are going to be hard and a lot of the time, you do overcome them. And when you don't overcome them, it is completely devistating; SO MAKE IF F****ING DEVISTATING. It makes you want to do better!!!   My thought... I dunno. Take'em or leave them   :)"

With some comboes of elements ruining each other, you cannot have a wide range of spell types for example, and stun/blind/etc is so powerfull that it doesn't make sense not to abuse it. In addition, attribute pooling to get optimal value from traders off your barter player, or perfect persuasion in encounters makes characters feel min-maxed to the point that they aren't characters, they feel like part of a would-be character, and very off to play.  Overall assesment: -You feel as playing a small part of a character, not a full character of your own, which is an extremely frustrating feeling with a background in games like Diablo."

BlindIdiotGod,31,4,2,February 7,Not Recommended,28.2,"According to Wikipedia, this game is widely regarded by critics as one of the greatest role-playing games ever. On the strength of these glowing reviews, I bought the game at full price, although I wasn’t able to get around to playing it until much later.  Had the game been released in the late 90s, it would probably be worthy of such glowing reviews. But if you’ve ever played a Bioware game or … well, actually any other CRPG, you couldn’t possibly believe such nonsense after playing this. The first real problem is the interface. I've played a few isometric games in my time, but never have I found the view so restrictive. It’s impossible to get any real sense of where you are in the world. This might have been resolved with a decent map system or compass but what there is just beyond awful. It feels utterly claustrophobic.  The camera controls are wholly counterintuitive. Eventually, I found the control to enable you to move the map by panning at the edges, and this improves the situation a thousandfold … meaning the game is now simply boringly mediocre rather than staggeringly awkward.  I say eventually because there’s barely any documentation and the in-game help is about as useful as flood defences in a desert.  The graphics are okay, but nothing to get super excited about. The music is likewise mediocre. However, that’s not really important if the playability is there. After all, I’ve lost more hours than I’m willing to admit to Nethack of all things, not to mention the Dominions series.  But is the playability there? Sadly no.  I got brutally slaughtered on my first foray into combat. It’s rather demoralising to be killed in the game’s tutorial bit on the ship. At first, I put this down to my ignorance of the combat system, but as I pushed forwards I began to realise that the game’s “deep” combat system is just another word for “hard”. If a fight to the death between a special forces commando with a black belt in every martial art known to man and a morbidly obese hamster took place in the Divinity system, then the AI controlled hamster will systematically break every bone in the commando’s body, pull his entrails out through his nose, and grind the rest up for burgers.  (It’s at this moment I expect the fanboys to chip in, bragging about how the game is “too easy”, how they beat it on super hard iron ball buster mode, one hand tied behind their back, blindfolded and being hung upside down by a pair of nipple clamps. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we’ve all heard it before. You’re so tough and good at video games. Yawn.)  You have to be a tactical expert because the slightest mistake results in watching various internal organs being spattered over the landscape. This is, of course, extremely realistic. It’s also extremely dull.  Because the combat system itself is not “deep”, at least no more so than any other game. Gosh, there are cool-downs? Yay! And different damage types?! Oh my gosh! Optimised attacks work well against some enemies but not others? Oh, my gosh, I haven’t seen anything like this since … umm … Pillars of Eternity? Every Bioware game ever? Third edition D&D? Or any other game in the last twenty years!  C’mon, the combat system is bog standard. That’s not a criticism – these things are tried and tested and there are only so many variations on the theme. It all seems to work well, other than being bone-crushingly hard – but it’s hardly earth-shattering innovation.  Then there’s pathfinding. You “chain” your characters together so they follow each other. And follow you they do. Well, sort of. Because every now and again, for no discernible reason, they stop following you. So you switch control to the lost character and move him to rejoin the party. Except now the whole party moves to follow that character (again, sort of). And because you can't find anything because of the godawful camera system and the godawful mapping, it’s like watching a bunch of spice zombies stagger around a British town centre.  And that reminds me. What is it with all the regional British accents? At first, I made the assumption the studio was British and almost thought it was refreshing not to have American accents in a video game. But the more I listened, the more affected and mocking the use of these accents seemed to be. And the studio is Belgian. Is this some kind of massive pisstake because of the Brexit vote?  So given the gameplay is utterly mediocre, what could it be that has inspired all these reviewers to practically have ♥♥♥♥♥♥s over how amazing this game is?  It must be the plot, the characterisation, right?  This is the first game in the series I’ve played and there was no effort at all to explain anything about the setting at all. I wake up on a ship, with a collar around my neck, to stop me using magic, magic is bad. Why is magic bad? Why am I in prison?  In games like Pillars of Eternity, Skyrim, Morrowind, Baldur’s Gate, etc. you were slowly introduced you to their mythos, until you become immersed in the culture of the setting. But not this game – I feel like I’ve started reading the Wheel of Time from Book 8 and I’m desperately trying to work out what the hell is going on. I realise there were prior games in the series, but it shouldn’t be a requirement to have played them in order to get a handle on what the hell is going on in this one. Who the hell is Lucian and why should I give a crap about him?  As for the characters, they have rich backgrounds and a complicated tag system. You mean in-game characters will respond differently to me depending on selections I make at character creation? Oh my gosh!  Again, this is hardly earthshattering and even less so when the application is a parade of walking clichés, badly animated, badly voice acted and poorly conceived.  And once you get in-game, you have the really annoying narrator telling you about how the person you’re talking to puts their finger up their nose or picks their bum or has another foible that is meant to ADD CHARACTER. This is a stock-in-trade of writing but it should be a subtle organic outgrowth of character - instead, it feels like I’m being hit over the head with a brickbat. “Look, see how I pick my nose? This means I’m not a stock character who’s going to be dead before this scene is out. It means I’m a living, breathing component of a real, persistent world. Don’t you see that I HAVE REAL CHARACTER.”  They don’t, of course, because most of them die before the scene is out or are otherwise singularly unimportant and as for the ones that don’t … well, you quickly wish they did.  And this oh-so-important characterisation isn’t remotely consistent. Let’s take Sebille: the cold, ruthless assassin. She turns StingingTail into sausage meat if you let her talk to him. Yet, if you prevent her murdering him – a slight she will never forgive! – you then have the chance to rat him out to Griff. Lohse and the Red Prince both object – the Prince for cultural reasons, Lohse is just a softie. But Sebille, who wants the guy dead, pipes up that snitching on him is as good as murder!  The woman is an assassin! Her entire life is orientated around murder! Even if you conceded that’s she was compelled to do this by her Master, why would she be trying to defend the life of someone that she herself intends to kill? It’s one thing to say “I want him dead by my hand” – at least that would be in character – but instead she sounds like a trainee vicar dumped with a street gang and shocked by their terrible behaviour.  So far I have found myself trapped on an island, with no clue as to what to do next, no driving narrative, forced to take up with companions that make the office bore sound interesting, wishing that the big tentacled thing had gotten me after all. It must get better, I told myself. It just must! It’s the greatest CRPG of all time. But hours later, to quote Father Jack, “I’m still on that fecking island!” and so thoroughly depressed I’m starting to see why he was permanently drunk. "

I say eventually because there’s barely any documentation and the in-game help is about as useful as flood defences in a desert.  The graphics are okay, but nothing to get super excited about. The music is likewise mediocre. However, that’s not really important if the playability is there. After all, I’ve lost more hours than I’m willing to admit to Nethack of all things, not to mention the Dominions series.  But is the playability there? Sadly no.  I got brutally slaughtered on my first foray into combat. It’s rather demoralising to be killed in the game’s tutorial bit on the ship. At first, I put this down to my ignorance of the combat system, but as I pushed forwards I began to realise that the game’s “deep” combat system is just another word for “hard”. If a fight to the death between a special forces commando with a black belt in every martial art known to man and a morbidly obese hamster took place in the Divinity system, then the AI controlled hamster will systematically break every bone in the commando’s body, pull his entrails out through his nose, and grind the rest up for burgers.  (It’s at this moment I expect the fanboys to chip in, bragging about how the game is “too easy”, how they beat it on super hard iron ball buster mode, one hand tied behind their back, blindfolded and being hung upside down by a pair of nipple clamps. Yeah, yeah, yeah, we’ve all heard it before. You’re so tough and good at video games. Yawn.)  You have to be a tactical expert because the slightest mistake results in watching various internal organs being spattered over the landscape. This is, of course, extremely realistic. It’s also extremely dull.  Because the combat system itself is not “deep”, at least no more so than any other game. Gosh, there are cool-downs? Yay! And different damage types?! Oh my gosh! Optimised attacks work well against some enemies but not others? Oh, my gosh, I haven’t seen anything like this since … umm … Pillars of Eternity? Every Bioware game ever? Third edition D&D? Or any other game in the last twenty years!  C’mon, the combat system is bog standard. That’s not a criticism – these things are tried and tested and there are only so many variations on the theme. It all seems to work well, other than being bone-crushingly hard – but it’s hardly earth-shattering innovation.  Then there’s pathfinding. You “chain” your characters together so they follow each other. And follow you they do. Well, sort of. Because every now and again, for no discernible reason, they stop following you. So you switch control to the lost character and move him to rejoin the party. Except now the whole party moves to follow that character (again, sort of). And because you can't find anything because of the godawful camera system and the godawful mapping, it’s like watching a bunch of spice zombies stagger around a British town centre.  And that reminds me. What is it with all the regional British accents? At first, I made the assumption the studio was British and almost thought it was refreshing not to have American accents in a video game. But the more I listened, the more affected and mocking the use of these accents seemed to be. And the studio is Belgian. Is this some kind of massive pisstake because of the Brexit vote?  So given the gameplay is utterly mediocre, what could it be that has inspired all these reviewers to practically have ♥♥♥♥♥♥s over how amazing this game is?  It must be the plot, the characterisation, right?  This is the first game in the series I’ve played and there was no effort at all to explain anything about the setting at all. I wake up on a ship, with a collar around my neck, to stop me using magic, magic is bad. Why is magic bad? Why am I in prison?  In games like Pillars of Eternity, Skyrim, Morrowind, Baldur’s Gate, etc. you were slowly introduced you to their mythos, until you become immersed in the culture of the setting. But not this game – I feel like I’ve started reading the Wheel of Time from Book 8 and I’m desperately trying to work out what the hell is going on. I realise there were prior games in the series, but it shouldn’t be a requirement to have played them in order to get a handle on what the hell is going on in this one. Who the hell is Lucian and why should I give a crap about him?  As for the characters, they have rich backgrounds and a complicated tag system. You mean in-game characters will respond differently to me depending on selections I make at character creation? Oh my gosh!  Again, this is hardly earthshattering and even less so when the application is a parade of walking clichés, badly animated, badly voice acted and poorly conceived.  And once you get in-game, you have the really annoying narrator telling you about how the person you’re talking to puts their finger up their nose or picks their bum or has another foible that is meant to ADD CHARACTER. This is a stock-in-trade of writing but it should be a subtle organic outgrowth of character - instead, it feels like I’m being hit over the head with a brickbat. “Look, see how I pick my nose? This means I’m not a stock character who’s going to be dead before this scene is out. It means I’m a living, breathing component of a real, persistent world. Don’t you see that I HAVE REAL CHARACTER.”  They don’t, of course, because most of them die before the scene is out or are otherwise singularly unimportant and as for the ones that don’t … well, you quickly wish they did.  And this oh-so-important characterisation isn’t remotely consistent. Let’s take Sebille: the cold, ruthless assassin. She turns StingingTail into sausage meat if you let her talk to him. Yet, if you prevent her murdering him – a slight she will never forgive! – you then have the chance to rat him out to Griff. Lohse and the Red Prince both object – the Prince for cultural reasons, Lohse is just a softie. But Sebille, who wants the guy dead, pipes up that snitching on him is as good as murder!  The woman is an assassin! Her entire life is orientated around murder! Even if you conceded that’s she was compelled to do this by her Master, why would she be trying to defend the life of someone that she herself intends to kill? It’s one thing to say “I want him dead by my hand” – at least that would be in character – but instead she sounds like a trainee vicar dumped with a street gang and shocked by their terrible behaviour.  So far I have found myself trapped on an island, with no clue as to what to do next, no driving narrative, forced to take up with companions that make the office bore sound interesting, wishing that the big tentacled thing had gotten me after all. It must get better, I told myself. It just must! It’s the greatest CRPG of all time. But hours later, to quote Father Jack, “I’m still on that fecking island!” and so thoroughly depressed I’m starting to see why he was permanently drunk. "

The new combat design philosophy is: ""every combat encounter must have screen-wide poison cloud explosions alternating with screen wide smoke on turn 1 and every turn thereafter. All enemies must constantly cast environment-effect spells (even turtles, alligators and dogs)"" Also, in tactical mode (the non cheesyeasy mode) instead of initative order turns, you now have alternating turns with the enemy group, which I think was set so exactly because of the new combat mess system.  It's a chaotic mess which looks awful and feels broken. Can't find the fun of it.   Can't really recommend."

Minde-LTU,102,2,1,"September 19, 2017",Not Recommended,169.8,"Very nyce game. It just has to much bugs. I seems that this game was released 3 months to early.   There could be some spoilers:  I found maybe 30 smaller bugs, and sevarl bigger: The final buttle to escape from Island - after I saved the game dissapered all my allies. Actually I did not realised, that's the bug, finished my several stories, come back, and they all missing. All my saves where used after that bug. Ok, I solo defeated the final bosses and escaped from island. But just because in classic mode the game for me was to easy, archer did not used any special arrows, I just used 1 ressurection scroll. All fights I finished with 80% helf. So the fights in classic mode are to easy.   And it's not tactical game. There are so much posibilities, that is not tactical game. For example enemy has teleporter. There are only sevaral common tactics. Put the archers on the top. And I used the trick to close the door. So I killed all magisters easy beeing  lvl 3. I let one magister fighter in the room, closed the door disabling magister archers and mages. Yes, that magister fither with dual sword was dealing damage 55, so with one critical hit or 2 normal hits he cut kill instantly my companions. But I  used the tactic that archers removed his armore (used the hart for double action points), and after that just knocked down him. It was the hardest fight for me, The second one hard fight was against the wich. But also, no oned died, I did not used any special arrow in any fight (just saving for hard fights).   I tried this game in hard mode. And hard mode is 2 or 3 times harder then cllassic. I prefer some game mode between classic and hard.   Yes, game is fune. If you fix one the most anoying bug and release more patches , I probably will delete this my negative review.   And the most anoying bug is fight vission system. It completely fails on some grounds. For example if some character is under the ark, he is out of vision in any way. If 2 charcaters are very close each other, but one is under ark, the second can't heal him or resurect or buff.   I could write the list with small issues, but I believe, that the developers already know them, there just prioritize releasing as fast as possible.  Ant this game is finished 98 or 99 %, but that 1% is annoying. I hate the bugs and hate rusing to release unfinished games."

Canton,91,3,1,"September 28, 2017",Not Recommended,17.5,"The armor system is shoehorned into this game in such a way as that many class combinations that are natural in most games of this type are useless; and there is no documentation warning people of this.  SImply put, you don't want to be doing both magical and physical damage at the same time, because you are then required to force your way through both armor types; there is no good reason to do this.  The result is that many skills simply don't work together, and the clusterf#ck is worsened when you attempt to pick classes and skills for  your party; only to find out later in the game that you chose wrong, and are now underpowered.  The problem is that they forced this beta idea into the game without testing it properly, and documenting its effects.  The result is that you get to restart over and over and over again until you figure out what works with what.  Paying money to beta test a product is an extremely anti-consumer business model; especially when the game has not been released in 'beta' mode.  Short version:  don't bother with this pay for beta release until at the very least guides come out explaining how to build your party properly."

It is extremely rushed out, seems to have never been tested as almost everything has at least one bug, has several glitches/exploits (infinite money, infinite turns, infinite damage, infinite rounds, ...), has soft & hard locks, randomly crashes when you are the Server and more broken stuff. One of our characters in the party had a permanent ""Warm"" status applied.  In addition to that, after Act 1 the rest of the game is way too fast and there is just not enough to do. We ended up staging a revolution against Magisters, Paladins, Demons, Voidwoken and one time even against critters. Act 2 is barely 2 hours long, Act 3 & 4 are about 1 hour total and then there is the next to impossible boss battle which is completely based on RNG. The final battle has a 1 in 2 chance to instantly murder your entire party, even if you fully build HP+Armor.  Basically, get this if you like being tricked into buying it by watching footage from Act 1, then get mad at all the bugs, glitches and exploits that you or NPCs may accidentally encounter and break the entire game.   VisualsThe game overall has an almost unchanging environment, everything looks very the same except a very few areas in which you then spend less than 5 minutes. Be prepared to see the same over and over again, because there is just no variation in the game.  GameplayThere's nothing really special to the game. It is a birds-eye-view kind of do-it-yourself RPG Action game with some elements of Story added in and Combat being way to overused to be anything special. There is also forced stealth sections (lovely /s) and forced PVP sections (yaaaaay /s), so if you were planning on actual coop there is none here in those areas.  BalanceYou won't find any balance in this game. Melee is overpowered as heck, Archery is completely broken, Mages are probably the only useless class as they either die Turn 1 or end up doing a little less than no damage at all unless Source Points are used. A lot of the spells need to be reworked as it otherwise makes absolutely no sense to ever have them memorized.   CombatCombat is turn based with each player having Action Points and each action costing these points. Unfortunately this is the area with the most bugs and is also horribly broken. If you test around a bit you can easily find a way to never have the enemy have another turn, but still resetting all your cooldowns and source points, resulting in ridiculously easy fights except in areas where fleeing no longer works because the plot device was turned on.  StoryThe story is your average ""Save the World or let it burn in flames!"" Story, very linear with choices that have absolutely no effect on the ending itself. The game could have been shipped without the main story and nobody would have noticed anything different as it is practically non-existent and was actually more of a side-quest until the ending came around. The endings are pretty as disappointing as the Mass Effect Colors endings, so brace yourself to be disappointed.  PVP""This games story absolutely needs PVP sections!"" - Larian Studios I don't even know why they put this in. They could have easily changed the sections to work for all players at the same time, not just one person that murders the rest because it's horribly imbalanced. To give you a run down, in the first PVP arena I two-shot the melee fighter after he successfully killed the ranger. Second arena we just gave someone the title and in the third arena we just Source Pointed each other into oblivion (Melee won because end-game melee > Range bug-fest > Toy Mage; seriously, mages don't do anything except statuses after Act 3 or so).

And thats only on classic/medium difficulty -Gameplay- Artistically the game is great and it really makes you want to love it but.... The gameplay kills it. you're tightly defined to what you spec into whether that be one school or two, generally not more than 3. low and behold just to make the game difficult and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ they decided to make the enemies you face in the first 20 minutes of the game have abilties from 6 different schools. you will have a♥♥♥♥♥♥whos a witch who uses necromancy and scoundrel(rogue basically) abilties, who also uses pyro and hydro spells, who also can use nether swap, who is also apparently a polymorph because he can turn people into chickens. I could kind of get it if it was some big bad boss whos up in high level high difficulty content. or maybe even if i was playing on honoured mode or w/e (hardest difficulty).  Its also a turn based game that cant seem to keep track of who's turn it is. the game will bug out and give you or the enemies 2 turns on the same character for no reason. the enemies will be allowed to attack with all 4 of their characters at once whereas you will usually only be able to attack once or cast one spell per turn and thats if you dont have to run your♥♥♥♥♥out of one of the milions of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ tedious damaging surfaces that are just everywhere because why the ♥♥♥♥ not, most of this game doesnt even feel like you're actually fighting it just feels like you're positioning yourself to use and abuse the surfaces to no end because theres no way to progress without doing it because thats the game. This is all while putting you into 4 vs 8 fights where every enemy is stronger than each of your party members. However, probably the most infuriating and glaring issue that make you want to slit your wrists right there at your keyboard is that line of sight only works for you. the enemies can cast and attack through walls, through the floor of the high ground, and from seemingly impossible angles and distances. Also make sure you save everytime you do anything anytime because if may just walk into some area you think has no enemies and then you're suddenly locked in a fight you cannot possibly win in any conceivable way. If you dont f5 save often and because their autosaves are placed in the worst possible places and times you will get put into the predicament where you either start over (not realistic if you're deep in the game) or you loose ridiculous amounts of progress because you have to load a older save because if you choose your most recent you will be immediatly placed back into said unwinnable fight. -""RPG""- RPG is a pretty broad genre but unless you're playing as an Origin character theres not really any RP to be found. theres confusing persuasion events that decide the outcome of minor inconsequential events but most of the time no matter what you say to an NPC they will give you the same dialogue option in response. even with the origin characters as party members you basically just get to watch them act their own♥♥♥♥♥♥out so you dont really make any descisions for them anyway you just get to comment on it to them. RPG 2/10  -Character Creation- you're just gonna confuse people having like 10 class presets when it really dumbs down to like 3 ♥♥♥♥ing stats. just let people switch between 3 or 4 its not like you cant change the stats to make yourself whatever you want regardless of what preset you choose. other than that the variation and variety is very nice however it would be nice if dwarf racials weren't so meta for most builds, dont wish the dwarf racials were weaker just wish the human, lizard, elf, and undead especially were stronger. 7.5-8/10 The customization is nice it just might confuse new people.  TLDR; Fix the Swamp/Marsh, Fix the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies in the first 30 minutes of the game with abilties from 6-8 different schools, FIX THE ♥♥♥♥ING LINE OF SIGHT LARIAN!

And it isn't helped by the whole way the plot seems to unravel into 'what are they smoking' when you reach the act past driftwood. It's like they just stopped trying to make sense, and through it as a hodgepodge of writers into a singular typewriter.  It just completely takes you out of what you enjoyed in it. And it stinks, but i can't see myself to finish it. Or recomend it. Between crashes, locks, and corruptions. I just wish it was all it claimed to be, and it could have been Divine."
mrwatts,12,1,3,June 26,Not Recommended,34.4,"2 hours in and I am bored stiff. 'Click all the things' is simply not a engaging game mechanic. It's all rail-roaded, there's simply no player agency here at all.  ed  (after 11hours because Steam declined my refund request) :  Made it to the second area (Fort Joy) level 2, halfway to level 3, and I have literally run out of things to do. The quests I have in my log don't lead me anywhere, there are no things to kill to level up. But then finding one cave gives me a half level.  WTF?  - Atrocious pacing and scaling. Come on devs this was your job.   - Numerous points-of-no-return where you move into an area and without warning cannot return. Forcing you to reload.  - Combat bugs - ranged abilities say out of range even though the tooltip indicatesthe ability is in range. Frequent LOS bugs, e.g says target is out of line of sight 4m away with nothing between me and the target.  - Lack of party combat roles. Trying to setup a blocker/tank and rear area damage dealers is pointless becuase the enemes just teleport past the tanks and the default range for ranged attacks is only 13m which is essentially right next to the tanks anyway.  - Camera sucks, I have developed a crick in my neck. Skills suck. Combat sucks. Quests suck. Everything sucks.  It all feels just so half-baked. I have no words to describe how bad this game is. How this game got made is beyond me.

If you are used to fast paced Games like POE and D3, this might possibly turn you off, since the overall Gameplay is very slow-paced, including (turn-based) Combat. it´s more about planing each encounter, positioning, reasonable Fighting, rather then stomping everything to dust.  It took me about 50 minutes to clear the first freaking scene (Ship)...including searching for Loot in Crates, talking to everyone and so on...

Mashed Buddha,160,39,2,"September 12, 2017",Not Recommended,39.7,"While quite the polished experience, it's just not the RPG I'm looking for.  Did I keep playing the early release content to the end?  Yes, but I just found it to be disappointing in so many ways, and hoped for it to improve as I persevered. (TLDR at bottom)  The story:  Overly dark and centered around death, rotting corpses, gore, etc.  It's tiring and boring.  Then there's all the ""mystic visions"" and ""gameplay"" where you're wandering through some alternate dimension just trying to get out to the real map and explore.  It's such a waste of resources to create these disjointed little sections of the game to jam pretentious god-story down the player's throat.  Combat:  I liked the combat, but ultimately the battlefield is just a mess.  Is battle supposed to be clean?  No, but the combat in DOS 1 was much tighter and way more satisfying tactically.  While DOS2 makes interesting use of height advantages, it's often hard to get your characters into position in time for this to be useful, with limited action points and freezing/crippling/etc spells slowing you down while you cause no damage in return, and usually the enemy is already placed in advantageous spots to attack you from.  This wasn't a huge part of the combat (if at all) in DOS 1, where again, the combat was much better.  For example, the rain spell in the first game was applied to a specific area of effect of your choosing; putting out the fire on your party, or applying it to your enemy only for whatever reason (like freezing chilled opponents).  The rain spell in DOS2 rains over everyone, friend and foe alike, so if you want to electrify the water on the ground, you likely have to take damage along with your enemies, or take away burning from everyone on the battlefield at once.  The camera:  It's mostly okay by itself, although I wish I could zoom out a bit more, and tilt down to see forward sometimes.  But the main issue here is the constant barrage of Tall Things scratching you in the eyeball.  Broken ruins posts, tall trees and hills, ship masts, etc. You'll be battling the environment for the right angles more than you fight the Magisters who persecute you at every turn.  Which leads me to another disappointing aspect of the game: The environments are so hard to navigate.  It's ""open world"" but you'll struggle to find the exact right paths that you're allowed to use while moving around the island, especially while backtracking. Where are the open environments to just traverse and explore?  So many people compare this to Baldur's Gate, yet this has no relation to the open locations found there, or in Fallout 1 , the Ultima games, or even this developers first release, Divine Divinity.  And finally, when Divinity Original Sin 1 was announced, it was marketed as a return to the Ultima style of gaming.  And yes, while you can pick up any fork you see, it's really missing the exploration, openness, and true freedom of those games.  Ultima 5, 6, and probably mostly trying to be reminiscent of 7.  There's no loading screens in those games and they came out in the 80s and early 90s.  No separate locations, and everything could be interacted with.  Yes there was less detail and simpler graphics, but less clutter and more freedom and satisfaction.  What did I like about the game?  I don't hate the combat, it's been fun at times.  Some of the characters are interesting, especially the NPCs who will join you (or you can play as, likely opening other story possibilities).  The challenge of getting out of Fort Joy and having multiple ways to do it, finally getting strong enough to go back and take out the enemies that needed to be avoided initially was satisfying.  I'm sure the replayability in the early game is appealing to some, but I rarely replay games and that doesn't make or break a game for me.  NPCs do react pretty well to the specific character you created (you have [ELF] dialog if you chose that race), and there are a decent amount of skill checks, which I like.  Talking to animals is neat.  Maybe Act 2 improves.  It will certainly be interesting to hear the voices I imagined get replaced by real voices.  TLDR: So if you don't mind my gripes, then all the power to ya, keep playing and replaying.  But if you haven't played the game and are looking for a more open, less cluttered, exploration based game with smarter turn-based combat and a more chill story, then this isn't the game for you."

Six enemies will teleport in from wonderland, and you will die in one or two turns.  Then you will load you last quick save, position your party members using the knowledge you gained from that death, and wipe the floor with the entire encounter without challenge.  This may seem like difficulty.  It isn't.  There is no tension.  There is no possibility of victory before loading the quick save, and no possibility of defeat after.  Boot up a virtual machine and start minesweeper with all the number hints turned off and take a memory snapshot each time you don't explode for the same experience.  Ok, that's a little harsh.

Also, as of Oct 31st, the game is getting major patches every few days to address the long list of problems that should have been addressed before the game was released.

CromX,214,6,5,"October 8, 2017",Not Recommended,245.5,"I cannot recommend this game. The developers have purposely taken every opportunity they can to literally troll players with instant death and unavoidable death mechanics that frankly turn this game into a chore to play. Simply walking a map which you walked a hundred times can be a serious chore, due to slow movement speed and then instant death from environmental things they set up that you can never see coming. Case in point covering a portal marker with instant death fog. A portal that previously was usable with no problems. And having no idea that they decided to put death fog all over that portal marker, you can port there and die instantly losing any progress you might have made.   These portal markers are meant to be convenience portal stones so you don't have to (slow) walk back and forth across the maps. So one would think they would not misuses the mechanic and the trust of the player in such a way. Not with these guys. I'm sure it was great fun, im my case I lost 20+ minutes of playtime. I had 30 mins to play before leaving, and  instead of satisfying game play I got this.   And that is just ONE example. How about playing for 10+ hours only to realize a quest is bugged and can't continue? Or having missed a valuable quest object hours back and the NPC you needed to see is missing or dead? You literally play this game in fear that your quests are all broken or not explained enough to where they make any sense. You can imagine the amount of reloading and backtracking that takes place in these scenarios.   Additonally:  1) atrocious inventory system. You never know which items will be useful later on, so you have to keep them all. And its ridiculous how much stuff you have. And lets be frank this game makes you interact with your inventory every three seconds which just makes this glaring problem unbearable at times.  2) overuse of teleport pyramids. In DOS 1 they had pyramid teleport items you could use in your inventory. It was quaint and used in some places to get around puzzles. It was never terribly fun as you had to trawl through your inventroy find it, toss one out, then trawl again find the other and then teleport to it. Rinse and repeat and it gets really old really fast. Well in DOS 2 they have doubled or even trippled down on this. EVERYTHING uses these lame pyramid teleport items, a bloody broken bridge just so you will have to dig through that ANNOYING inventory and port people across. ANNOYING. I get it they think their pyramid teleport stones are cool! WE GET IT, PLEASE STOP WITH IT!  3) PUZZLES, everything is a puzzle. And lots of time its obscure, or just a huge time sink. The occasional puzzle can be good for content, but like everything in this game its an overused mechanic. I swear you do one lame puzzle that takes like 30 mins and then in the next room over another one. It's gets old real fast and often involved trawling though the inventory and reading the THOUSANDS of books they drop during the game. Otherwise google it if you can find it. It's a real chore.  4) Fights often are just huge alpha strikes by the enemy that CC your entire party if not kill them outright. Its a frequent occurrence that you will sit turn after turn CCed until death.   All in all stay away from this game unless you are a die hard DOS 1 fan. I had been putting up with all those annoyances because for the most part I figured it was just the developers not understanding the impact all these minor issues were having on the player. But once they start trolling people with instant death at portal markers for god's sake its time to come to terms with the fact these are not the best of guys. They intentionally want to waste your time and ruin your game play, and in a lot of ways they succeed.  Stay away, or buy heavily discounted."

MV3,252,2,0,"October 6, 2017",Not Recommended,3.2,"Didn't like any character in the character creation menu. Weird elves, chubby female humans. You can only change between a few preset faces, as far as customization goes. And then almost every male melee armor has that super fat leg-armor skin - I just don't get it. It doesn't make sense at all. Immersion killer.  There is a fine line between nerdy vs. nerdy while still being cool. This game is much more on the nerdy side. Nothing wrong with it though. Just not for me. Similar to when Metal bands go viking/mythologic. Just not for everyone. I'm sure it's a good if not great game, but you gotta like it from the beginning. I couldn't get immersed and play the class the way I imagined it.  Thankfully, I got my money back. Refund accepted - great success!"
CromX,214,6,5,"October 8, 2017",Not Recommended,245.5,"I cannot recommend this game. The developers have purposely taken every opportunity they can to literally troll players with instant death and unavoidable death mechanics that frankly turn this game into a chore to play. Simply walking a map which you walked a hundred times can be a serious chore, due to slow movement speed and then instant death from environmental things they set up that you can never see coming. Case in point covering a portal marker with instant death fog. A portal that previously was usable with no problems. And having no idea that they decided to put death fog all over that portal marker, you can port there and die instantly losing any progress you might have made.   These portal markers are meant to be convenience portal stones so you don't have to (slow) walk back and forth across the maps. So one would think they would not misuses the mechanic and the trust of the player in such a way. Not with these guys. I'm sure it was great fun, im my case I lost 20+ minutes of playtime. I had 30 mins to play before leaving, and  instead of satisfying game play I got this.   And that is just ONE example. How about playing for 10+ hours only to realize a quest is bugged and can't continue? Or having missed a valuable quest object hours back and the NPC you needed to see is missing or dead? You literally play this game in fear that your quests are all broken or not explained enough to where they make any sense. You can imagine the amount of reloading and backtracking that takes place in these scenarios.   Additonally:  1) atrocious inventory system. You never know which items will be useful later on, so you have to keep them all. And its ridiculous how much stuff you have. And lets be frank this game makes you interact with your inventory every three seconds which just makes this glaring problem unbearable at times.  2) overuse of teleport pyramids. In DOS 1 they had pyramid teleport items you could use in your inventory. It was quaint and used in some places to get around puzzles. It was never terribly fun as you had to trawl through your inventroy find it, toss one out, then trawl again find the other and then teleport to it. Rinse and repeat and it gets really old really fast. Well in DOS 2 they have doubled or even trippled down on this. EVERYTHING uses these lame pyramid teleport items, a bloody broken bridge just so you will have to dig through that ANNOYING inventory and port people across. ANNOYING. I get it they think their pyramid teleport stones are cool! WE GET IT, PLEASE STOP WITH IT!  3) PUZZLES, everything is a puzzle. And lots of time its obscure, or just a huge time sink. The occasional puzzle can be good for content, but like everything in this game its an overused mechanic. I swear you do one lame puzzle that takes like 30 mins and then in the next room over another one. It's gets old real fast and often involved trawling though the inventory and reading the THOUSANDS of books they drop during the game. Otherwise google it if you can find it. It's a real chore.  4) Fights often are just huge alpha strikes by the enemy that CC your entire party if not kill them outright. Its a frequent occurrence that you will sit turn after turn CCed until death.   All in all stay away from this game unless you are a die hard DOS 1 fan. I had been putting up with all those annoyances because for the most part I figured it was just the developers not understanding the impact all these minor issues were having on the player. But once they start trolling people with instant death at portal markers for god's sake its time to come to terms with the fact these are not the best of guys. They intentionally want to waste your time and ruin your game play, and in a lot of ways they succeed.  Stay away, or buy heavily discounted."

markharris31,165,54,12,"August 12, 2017",Not Recommended,155.9,"The game isn't all that fun, honestly.    Pros: -Game looks great and plays well.  Runs very smoothly especially for early access.   -There's a wide variety of skills, skill types, and weapons in the game. -Dialog so far is interesting and well written.  Story seems pretty interesting. -Characters in general have their own personalities and agendas, with some witty lines.  I have a few minor gripes with the characters and npc interaction, but overall I think characters are a definitely a positive. -Ability to change the class of joining characters is a great idea.  It wasn't there in early alpha so I'm really happy to see it now. - Animations are actually quite good, armor and weapon designs are thoughtful and race specific.  Aesthetic is impressive, honestly. - Environmental interaction and ability to combine spell effects with the environment is a very cool concept  Cons: -Prepare to spend hours trying to beat a single pitched battle with minions, let alone boss characters. -It's easy to create characters with absolutely horrid efficacy and no way to back out of those choices.  -The important set pieces have you either outnumbered (think 10 on 4 at times) and/or ambushed.  Normally this would be fine, since your characters will have skills and abilities that can get you out of said situations.  However, since in most ambush situations all enemy characters move first, you can easily find yourself stun-locked to a quick death.  Multiple rounds of just watching your stunned/frozen/knocked down/crippled/diseased characters getting ripped apart by enemies with a variety of debuffing skills that require no cooldown is just flat out boring.  That's not a battle, it's not a game of chess with the enemy, it's not preparing and having skills that can counter enemies (since of course removing a debuff with my 5 turn cooldown skill means nothing since 6 enemies can just re-stack the debuff next round).  It's a boring slaughter.  -Twenty minutes into a turn based fight, when a single enemy with 2 HP can stun 3 members of your team that have full armor that should resist the debuff, heal itself, and then teleport away all in the same turn, that's a problem.  Then proceed to restack the debuff every turn while you just sit there watching and have no chance to counter or do anything at all (since entire team stunned for 3 rounds each time enemy attacks).  It's just not enjoyable.   Overall: -I want to love this game, and I think there are some really cool mechanics to it.  But I have a life outside video games, and spending hours trying to find the right combination of strategy and luck to win a single fight is not something I have time to do.  I enjoy a good challenge, I just don't have 500 hours to put into a game just because I get ambush/stunlocked into death over and over again.  That's really not fun."

This is not really the game fault (maybe because other 4 player games are working just fine). I was using Nvidia Shield TV to stream the game to my living room TV. All 4 joysticks ware able to navigate the menus but they all are recognized as one joystick. So no way to pick the four different profiles. It took a while but I tested this by connecting the joysticks directly to the PC and removing the Shield TV. From this point I was able to pick the profiles.  On the character creation screen all 4 players were shown on top of each other (including the right side menus). No way you can configure anything. We tried to just go with what was selected by default (so we can at least see the actual game). You need to press the start button on each controller. Unfortunately one of the controller was not able to do that for some reason. I was able to see that he can rotate the camera and sound effects ware there but he couldn't press start.  At this point we just gave up. Plugged the joysticks back to the shield TV and played some 4 coop Broforce (no problems at all).  I'm refunding the game now.

Yoshiris,42,3,1,"November 11, 2017",Not Recommended,85.0,"Pros: The story line is good.  The battle is good.  Cons: The camera is aweful. Navigating the map is a stressful mess. When your party member finds a hidden treasure, he says he spotted something, but the map is so hard see that you can't tell where that shining mound is. The NPC will tell you of a location of a cave, but even if you are standing right in front of it you can't see the entrance. Exploring the world is supposed to be full of surprises and a sense of adventure. Instead it just feels like a series of rotating the camera in order to understand your surroundings.  The UI is aweful too. You can learn a few dozen skills in the game, but you can only see one bar of skills and need to toggle the bars all the time to use the skills. The only way to manage skill bars is by adding one skill or deleting one skill.  There is no sorting for skills so you have to manually sort the skill bars. And when you have your skills sorted and you want to insert a fire skill that you just learnt, you have to delete a skill in that slot, meaning you have to reorganize every skill after the skil bar. Maybe sorting is too hard to implement, but why can't we just insert a skill?  Inventory management sucks too.  There are mildly valuable things on the streets, but as you keep picking them up your inventory becomes a mess that you don't want to look at.  The content of the game, the story and the battle system are good. But the interface is so horrible that it is impossible to enjoy them. I would love to play the game if the camera is a normal third person view, and the UI gets polished enough or the game rule changes such that you don't need a polished UI (limit the number of skills you can memorize to 8, don't litter the world with trashes so your inventory doesn't clog up.  At this moment it feels like they made a world that they wanted to make without caring about how the player experiences it. They might think the game is strategic and fun when you have 4 members full of 50 skills and items, but in reality having to manage all these things is too much hustle."

VonDodo,113,3,5,"December 27, 2017",Not Recommended,56.4,"Update after many hours.  The game puts a lot of focus on fights. Unfortunatley fights are plagued by the lack of testing, recent arbitrary nerfs and the non linearity (usually a good thing as long as you put some mechanics to prevent problems) of the maps.  I.E. its common to end in impossible fights you are supposed to face with more characters OR with quest items OR again at higher levels... and you can t figure out if they are supposed to be so.. because in the beginning you are too weak for almost any fight.  Second Same arbitrary nerfs not properly tested and some bugs ends up screwing story that instead would be nice.  Also you can end in dialogues that consider you talked to people you never talked to because story is somehow linear but areas are open thus they expect to follow an order that is not even clear and ignore if you do or not.  Some awful bugs for example are: 1) source nerfs (see flaming pigs quest) 2) teleport pyramids and much more.  In the end you can change settings to easy and change from total frustration of some fights to boringly easy the difference is huge between normal and easy.  Tag system is a really good idea its a pity this game seems unfinished and unpolished..... and trying to be difficult in the wrong way....with opponents being in most case teleporting fighters/wizards that shoot aoes from distance starting from better position.....

Zeph Grey,475,11,2,"November 20, 2016",Not Recommended,265.4,"More of the same.  As much as I love the combat system in this and the previous D:OS its surrounded once again by a tedious, meandering plot, and annoying, unlikable characters.  What's worse, is that there are simply no advencements in game play.  The once promised day/night cycles once again failed to appear, NPC schedules are still absent, and everything just feels like an add-on to the first, instead of a true sequel.  I can't say its a bad game, it just brings nothing new to the table, and has no real reason to exist other than to justify another Kickstarter. (which I was hopeful enough to back)  Maybe something new or spectacular will come along in EA, but the mechanics feel pretty set at this point, and they simply fail to amaze.    It is noteworthy I guess that their elves manage to out-ugly TES elves by a shocking degree. The lizard people are no prize either.  Character designs in general are simply badly misconceived.  Oh, and the control collar bit they start the game with is lifted in it's entirety from Dungeon Siege 2.  They didn't alter it at all. Even the models used look almost identical. "

E.g. how every time I talk to the Red Prince on the beach, his dialogue immediately closes, but only for my main character. Everyone else is fine :)  Have so far played well more time than supposedly this version allowed, but I've completed annihilated all of the magistrates inside the fort, which took a fair bit of strategy to complete.  Which hints on one point of joy; where I can move things around in the environment to block the enemy out and deal with subsections of them. Inside the fort, for example, I set up a small killzone in a side room and blocked out the main door. Then I teleported the main enemy into the side room, took him down, followed by teleporting each enemy back through for removal--seemingly allowing me to take many more enemies on than I would have head on.

PoopShoot69,56,2,2,"September 30, 2017",Not Recommended,69.2,"If you like fun games, this isn't the game for you. This game has a vertical learning curve and is extremely punishing of any mistakes. Win a few fights, have a few party member deaths? OOPS - you're out of resurrection scrolls, your party is permanently dead - unless you can find 1,000+ gold to buy a scroll (which you can't, there's not enough lootable items in Fort Joy Ghetto (the starting zone) to purchase even one scroll). From the start, the enemies you face are fully equipped with good weapons, shields, and scale/plate armor - whereas you're wearing rags and wielding a shiv or a makeshift hammer. Only on its easiest difficulty is combat realistically winnable in the beginning, but then it's so easy it's just meaninglesss. Unless you like facerolling on easymode or playing through the first zone a hundred times to learn about how to make a good party of heros, don't bother with this game.  I thought it could be the heir to Baldur's Gate and other similar awesome RPGs, but this is simply not fun. It could have been fun had the difficulty gradually ramped up instead of being a vertical wall of frustration.

But no, so it has to be thumbs down  First off, I played D:OS 1 and loved it. Great challenging game with many choices, not only in combat but also in the path you wish to proceed forward.  That being said, D:OS 2 offers pretty much the same mechanichs af it´s predecessor, but only harder, much much harder. Allow me to break it down, what is good and what is not if you are concidering bying this game   Overpowered enemies   I don´t know what Larian was thinking, but lvl progress doesn´t seem to match the enemies you face. I play on classic mode, and several times when encountering an enemy that is your lvl, you get wiped out completely. Your whole party, usually within 2 turns. This is immensly frustrating, and you spend many hours desperately looking for for lighter quests to complete, so you can advance and gain the upper hand. Most enemies can only be defeated if you are 1 lvl above. If that´s your thing, punching keyboard and ragequitting, this is the game for you   Broken quests   Many times I have hovered over and around the same quest looking for enemies or items that were nowhere to be found, and once you have completed a particular quest, it is still indicated on your map as still active. Hours have been wasted waking around trying to solve already solved quests   Movement and turnbased fights   Your party memebers move around like they are complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Most of the time they stop somewhere random and don´t keep up, or they see a trap and dive head first right into it. Happens more or less all the time. The turnbase fight could be alot of fun it they turnbased system were in any way fair, but it usually goes like this: First enemy stuns you and all your companions, drain all you armour, goes into overpowered mode and takes away half of your energy. Next up is the enemies companions who do exactly the same and you are molested very quickly   SJW enviroment (at times)     So - We live in a time where political correctness is of the essence, and the disease of SJW has infested gaming all together. For instance, a dialogue can go as following in DO:OS 2 (I exagerated a bit, to enhace it´s meaning):  - Ifan: ""So, Beast, we made it this far. I´m glad I made this journey with you. Good to have you around""  - Beast: *Smiles suspiciously* ""Yes, me too. Say, have you ever been with someone of your sex?""  Beast gets undressed, a major erection emerges before you, he pulls you close   1.) You push him away 2.) You smile akwardly and try to talk your way out of it 3.) You let him penetrate you 4.) You french kiss him, and see what happens happens  Now, if you are gay, that´s fine and I geniuenly hope that you are happy with you self and your partner, but why does have to in a game in such a poor and badly written manner? If at all? We all know why it is there, if not the game would be hammered for being homophobic and what not. Could we dial it down a notch? Pls  I wanted this game to be more than it is, I wanted it to be the game of the year. I its good, or I would say 50% fun/50% frustration. I am almost at the end of the game, and I can´t seem to make it the final strecth. I just don´t care anymore, too much frustration has killed it for me  Overall 6.5/10 - Just approved"

Hugh amount of reading and looooooooooooooong long texts for multiple choices just like social science final exam are especially overdone since the whole plot and stories where everybody is ""god""-related are so empty and vain that they don't connect to me to the least degree. Exhausted and turned to wiki walkthrough/quest crack after a period of pain in the *ss after unlocking 3 sources. Extremely devastating quest and item UI make all the great attempts in high freedom exploration pointless. How many of you got stuck in the main quest by losing Purgin Wand/Obsidian some knife/that bowl and many other critical things? Even the stupidest RPG knows better to categorize quest item. I simply can't risk any more of my time and patience and anxiety attack after two bitter search just free exploring without guide. The only design that attracts me is the wide variety of skills BUT before your intention to use those elemental flamboyant AOE to wipe minor slimes really take effect your teammates are already dead in the friendly fire. Soon after the 2 hour refund time was past I was forced to restart with 2 Lonewolf elemental mages. The world was clearer after that. Definitely overpowered. But there is no wandering monster to fight at all. I have to massacre towns to get to use a cycle of skills combination. Really want to restart with other 4 characters in a pure physical team but back to the above 2 points, overwhelming reading and quests, I even find my research papers more attracting. In all, DOS2 fails in many things Witcher 3 excelled, appealing stories, tidy backpack, clear quest log. It doesn't live up to the same scale of high praise."

However the camera controls ruined this game for me. I don't normally complain about camera controls but I felt often that I was more trying to position the camera more than I was playing the actual game. The fighting with the camera made the large areas with massive detail more daunting than exciting and exploration felt like a hassle. Another issue I had was the detail and the lack of significant marking on characters. This could be because I'm visually impaired but because there is SO MUCH on your screen at once and so much folliage and trees everywhere I found it hard to find NPCs and even monsters let alone my own party members.  I'm not saying the game is bad per say but I can't personally reccomend it however lots of people seem to love it so maybe take your chance on it?

I have never in my life seen a game so completely ruined in the final act as this game. I didn't even finish the first playthrough because of the last fight which was beyond my capabilities. Despite this, I put together a new team and went through it again (all mage this time). Yes I'm stupid.   This game eats away your time. It doesn't value it at all. You will waste so much time re-moving characters because they don't want to go through some measly poison or fire that they'll heal from right away. You'll waste time on every save / reload - at least 30 seconds on saves and 1 minute or more on reloads. You'll waste time reskilling your characters because you remove a piece of equipment. You'll waste time trying to target a character when your entire screen is covered in cursed fire. You'll waste time with quests that you can't complete (I can't believe that Tarquin bug still isn't fixed on my 2nd playthrough despite so many assurances on release notes). You'll waste time & get carpal tunnel with all the mouse moving to close windows that obscure you view. You'll waste time moving wares from one character to another because the designers choose to waste your time instead of just having one wares for the entire party. You'll waste time combining & recombining potions because they think that animations and sounds for one combine are so cool they couldn't possibley give you a button that will COMBINE ALL. You'll waste time when the battle is going on for minutes because the designers believe FIREBALLS should have a TURN.   It spits on your time, it constantly makes you waste your time and you perservere & trudge through it and then it completely vomits over all you have done & accomplished in the final act.   I'm talking about MULTIPLE stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battles -  and you'll spend so much time reading how to get through these  stupid ♥♥♥♥♥♥ battles just to cheese them to progress and even those will be wrong.   But it culminates with not one but two stupid completely vomit in your face battles that you'll keep wondering how you continued to play this game.

The voice acting and options (MOST OF THE TIME) add a lot of flavor to the game, other times, does not matter what option you choose, the predetermined outcome is happening, screw you and your  well thought out choice.  I both like the battle that is turn based, and loathe it.  All of the fanboiz rating 9/10, and 10/10, and heralding GREATEST GAME EVAH I just don't get.  You won't get that here.  Here, you will get truth.  Hard cold truth.  Allow me to put on my ""GIT GUD"" armor on.  Ok now that's on.    I resent having to ""study ahead"" for my fights, even on one step ahead of casual difficulty.   When I engage in a fight for the first time, 95% of the time, I get jacked, hard.  By the way second easist difficulty name escapes me.  The mechanics of this game are amazingly unforgiving.  Yes yes, youtube videos, walk throughs on character develpment, blahblahblah.  I love watching youtube videos of people with 45 strength or 50 finesse when I have 15 and maxxed out all I could.  I expect a challenge when I fight.  I don't expect to try moving the coffins over here and lead this one guy out alone, or telekinesis this over there to build a wall to prevent mobs that I have no previous knowledge of them being there in the first place.  Sun Tzu would have killed to have the preknowledge it takes to win some fights in this game.  I hear plenty of talk about how this is a herald back to the old gold box D&D games, or a reminder of how it used to be in D&D with a DM reading off the descriptions for the module some of us were playing on a Saturday night.  DM never let us look at the notes and see where the monsters were hanging, and what their hit points were.  At least, mine didn't.  Yours?  Battle won after the third youtube video watched, 2nd or 3rd hour reloading the game, treasure collected.  It seems... hollow.  Onto the next series of saving - reloading.  Bottom line, I like a challenge, not a flogging.  This is a flogging.  Unclear battle mechanics, and get ready to wear out your F5 key.  6/10 "

Aphex,120,2,0,"November 15, 2017",Not Recommended,98.8,I prefer the first game. Magic/Armor-System ruined the game for me and was propably implemented to balance multiplayer/pvp.  Using skills is pointless because by the time they would do anything other than damage you might as well finish off the enemy. This makes combat super boring due to lack of tactics and forgett about using the environmental effects like in OS:1....enemies will just walk through them. The exessive use of verticality and the spread of enemies only add to that issue and make aoe spells useless. Mages simply suck. Magic armor makes enemies immune to all spell-cc and phys.-armor makes them immune to phys.-cc. Going either full phys or magic team is the way to go.  Oh did i mention that you are limited to 6ap total now? Stupid descision and clearly another attempt to balance pvp.  Itemisation is ♥♥♥♥ed. Scaling is ridiculous. People ended up defeating the end boss in one turn due to terrible balancing. Using warfare is mandatory for ALL physical charakters including archers due to damage multiplication. Cross character combos are non existant. Game is a dumbed down mess.  In conclusion: Poorly implemented new systems that are outright unnesscesary. Why fix what isn't broken?  The camera/environment doesn't help either because something is constantly blocking your view.  Overall rating: Monumental dissapointment. Buy the first game instead and then forget about the series.

Most of the achivments are mostly just to do certain task in a certain way, or jsut get to a certain ponit regardless of which path you took to get to the same goal.  But WHY is there system in place that basicly tells you ""NO! You shouldn't mod!"" --------------------- Because... despite how good this game is, there are some flaws with this game. --------------------- Some are subjective, like the balancing, but some are objective such as UI elements. Why try to dictate how any player should play their single player game?  I have been playing, and I am getting very frustrated on every... single... item... you pick up goes to the action bar. THE ACTION BAR IS A MESS AND A CONSTANT ♥♥♥♥ING SOURCE OF ANOYANCE!  Here is an analogy: It's like, you clean your houes. You go about your day for an hour. And suddenly the houes is in the same vrecked state as you began with. :(  There are mods that limit what items get automaticly added to the action bar. They do not make enemies weaker... It doesn't make you stronger... All it does... is make a more enjoyable experience where you can focus more on the game, and not being a bloddy maid and keep cleaning your action bar every 5 steps in the game.   A mod that would make the game just objectivley more enoyable for us that wish to use it, can not be used. Because it would dissable achivments... ******************************************** Inbalanced mods:  And... let say you DO wanna play with a mod that changes game balance?  ... It is a single player game with co-op elements. Why not let people play as a god charachter if they want to? I don't want to... but I see NO reason as to why a person shouldn't be able to do as they wish!  Did anyone ever say in Skyrim; ""Man! I wish they would block achivments! Because if some random♥♥♥♥♥player wanted to put Randy Savage into the game as a dragon. That would make achivments pointless!"" ********************************************  ... I got nothing more to say! I mean, can anyone say anything more after using Randy Savage as a dragon, as a argument?  I rest my case!  So go ahead, do get the game! Because it is great!

Orramus,147,No,0,June 15,Not Recommended,73.1,"Solid don't-buy.  Bugs galore. Crashes. Stuck quests. Restarts.  Unbalanced and simply un-fun combat. Look on the Internet, the fact that almost all fights are cheesable and people spend so much time looking for game-breaking tactics says it all. Barrelmancy may be good for a laugh but why even bother implementing a RPG progression system then?  Unimaginative plot (setting and characters were pretty great though, with rather interesting back-stories). Some quests went nowhere—it's not ""groundbreaking"" to end quests without resolution, don't celebrate that.  Divinity Original Sin was a masterpiece most games could only dream of emulating, and sadly, this sequel failed. From beginning to end the chief impression I got was that the team spent too much time congratulating itself for the first game that it thought it could market a half-baked product on goodwill.  Obvious Larian didn't bother to polish, because why should they? This is what you get from dumbass developers funded by even dumber fans (looking at you Kickstarter backers—what were you even thinking?)"

There's not much new here.  It's Dungeons and dragons by another name, yep, it really is.  It's obvious that the designers are huge D&D fans, but unfortunately most mature gamers grew out of DnD when they went past puberty.  The graphics are nice, the elemental effects are visually believable, the sound is appropriate and the story can keep our attnetion a good deal of the time.  The gameplay is basic, the character generation really doesn't give much of a clue about what your characters can actually do in game and why you should or should-not focus on to make effective choices, the multi player aspect can be a compelte waste of time as many players play as if they are playing single player, playing just for themselves and running in to encounters and starting battles when the rest of the party are looting a room elsewhere, etc.  I've started single player games and soon after a random person joined, more than once, somehow...  The weakest part though is the system.  It's still all hitpoints and stats, blancing and book-keeping to try and out hitpoint your opponents. Doing lots of extra damage from behind for assassin type characters, magic existing as purely just another way to inflict hit-point damage, chests containing treasure absolutely everywhere for some unknown reason, etc, etc.  The overused, clichéd ideas come thick and fast and don't stop until the final enemies are dead.  I feel that the best part is the plot and overall story, but it's not being carried well by it's DnD-esque antiquated system that they have under the hood.  I would recommend it if you want a turn-based, third person crpg, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're tired of the childish simplicity of Dungeons and dragons tropes and rule systems."

Sammy Spudgun,364,4,5,September 13,Not Recommended,52.7,"Step 1: Get into fight. Step 2: Lose fight after 5 minutes. Step 3: Use savescumming to put your units in optimal position for the fight. Step 4: Lose fight after 13 minutes. Step 5: Realise you didn't save before your previous attempt, which had really good positioning. Step 6: Win fight after an hour total. Step 7: Get into a fight with the next group of enemies.  I gave this heap of smeg multiple attempts. Eventually I gave up out of frustration and boredom after reloading a single fight 8 times in Act 2.  Recently, I tried the Definitive Edition with two friends, and it started off well; We were all having a good time. However, as soon as we stopped fooling around - murdering every NPC in Fort Joy - and tried to progress, we came up against a fight that killed the fun. A fight that, despite our being level 6 from our rampage, gave us a game over four times, each after an agonizingly long run.  In these runs, I saw every design decision and bit of balance that made me resent the original game left perfectly intact. For instance, the ""decaying"" status effect is horrendously designed. With little visual indication, it's all too easy to accidentally kill yourself while trying to heal, and there are very many enemies that are capable of inflicting it on you. In addition, magic is still comically weak compared to physical damage. Why bother with it when everybody has their own elemental resistances? Even when an enemy has higher physical armour, just wailing on them will invariably kill them faster than trying to whittle down their magical armour.   While I am by no means averse to difficult games, this game's difficulty mixes with it's slow pacing like orange juice and toothpaste.   As for the armour system, I cannot dump hard enough on it. In most games, armour reduces the amount of HP damage you take from certain types of attack. This is fine. In others, armour is instead a seperate bar that has to be emptied before HP damage is dealt. This is also fine. What isn't fine, however, is having two seperate bars for physical defense and magical defense. It only serves to punish you for trying to mix up your strategy. It means that your wizards can't soften up an enemy for the knight, unless you spend a long time emptying both the enemy's physical and magical armour, but why would you take the time to do that? A far more sensible system would be a single armour bar with a sliding scale of whether it takes more damage from magic or from physical attacks. But that's too much like good game design to be in this. Imagine if you were playing DOOM and every enemy had a seperate HP bar for every weapon you have. I can honestly say that the DOS2 armour system is one of the most poorly designed mechanics I have encountered in any game I've played, and I've played some garbage.  It's a poorly balanced and poorly designed slog. You're dissuaded from mixing magical and physical damage by the core mechanics: In order to HP damage, you first off have to empty your target's respective magical armour or physical armour bar. The story is uninteresting, featuring a bland doomsday antagonist. On the bright side, it's impossible to get truly angry at the difficulty because you'll be too bored to be angry!  I sincerely wanted to enjoy this game, but every single time I found myself thinking ""I am not having fun, why am I trying to deny this?"""

Most people will actually enjoy and remember the 1 or 2  rather op powers they got at some point in the game and completely forget all the other boring mediocre powers that didn't mean anything for the gameplay! This has always been true, but it began to be forgotten by the developers since when MMORPGs became a thing, because at that point games weren't single player only anymore and players didn't like that some classes could be stronger than others or that some powers were op and could one-shot them.

Stuck in fort joy and have done a bunch of side quests to ""Show me the way out of fort joy"" and my map has updated with zero, 0, nada way points or PoIs that show any story progession. Looked into it and basically had to resort to youtube and walk throughs in order to find things out which isnt what I paid for. Early combat is heavily squed to the side of the game and difficulty isnt really shifted in the right way imo. The main thing that was annoying was that the difficulty mod was a hard lesson as the intro level on the ship is long and boring after the first time you play through it.  I also have some heavy critisism for the enrionmental aspects of the combats. I understand that the creators were trying to have a heavy focus on positioning and AoE aspects of the game but litterally every fight has some kind of zone or area that will suddenly make the battle one sided, even oil throwing crocks for some odd reason that will ignite a torch nearby and nuke half the screen. Like I get it, you wanted something more than hack and slash and you wanted a cool new aspect to the rpg experience but every single freaking fight doesnt have to have archers shooting firebombs or fire cocktails or poison containers.   Camera controls are ♥♥♥♥ and need a serious overhaul imo too. you can spin but there is no pitch and in order to see half the time i feel like i had to blind click into areas.

Every fight is ridiculously hard, the AI even in the lowest difficulty is way too smart, and when I say way too smart I mean like 500 IQ. On my normal difficulty play through the AI has many times, attacked their own teammates to heal or remove a status effect, Placed their character perfectly against a wall/barrel/lamp/other player too avoid backstabs, but almost every turn the enemy AI will move just outside of your attack range. THIS IS NORMAL DIFFICULTY. This is one of my biggest issues with the game not to mention the fact that if you stumble onto enemies one or two levels higher then you, you basically lose instantly.   The second issue is this game was named wrong, Divinity: Original Sin 2? Nah more like teleportation gloves the game. Its like the entire ♥♥♥♥ing game revolves around this pair of gloves. From beginning to end these gloves are always there being used in one way or another.  Half the time Im playing this game im walking around aimlessly trying to find a fight I can win or looking for some way to teleport across or to somthing.  Edit: Positive things about the game I forgot to mention because I was on a rant  The dialouge in this game is very good, along with the origin stories for your companions are very rich and take you to strange places.  The abilities are really cool, wether you are a trying to be a powerful mage or a strong melee character you are given a vast variety of abilites to shape your characters.  As I mentioned the AI is very hard so if you're looking for some challenge this is right up your alley  And to anyone who thinks this game isn't hard and the statement is laughable you are wrong. The game gives you a warning about the combat before you start and here's a statement from the store page saying the AI is hard ""beware - the game’s AI 2.0 is our most devious invention to date""  All in all I give this game 3/5"

Whatever you do, do not think of this as an rpg, it is not. Its an arena sim. All these different builds you see, all are about doing the same damn thing, but with some diffent skill.   Want to get a heads up on not wasting your time for first few days of playing this crap? Spend hours watching videos to learn the game cause thats only way, else just waste a lot of time in trial and error.   Forget the typical group, mage, tank, healer, rogue. Thats a recipe for death and frustration. It is NOT the base premise for balance in this idiotic game, which is why its so frustrating. People who make games to look like an RPG, then deliver this diablo crap should be called out for it.   And yes I am saying it, Diablo 3 was crap and so is this. So on my 3rd start after wasting alot of time watching build videos I still get wiped easily. Why? Dunno my tanks have some magic armor on their gear but none when fight starts. Why? Who knows and I am not gonna waste more time figuring that out. Most of the fights are big set pieces designed to  wipe your group or drain you of res scrolls etc. Its same thing every fight but the mobs look different.  The people liking this crap must be diablo 3 lovers cause this is not an RPG and not much like DOS 1. It appears, at least the early game, to be balanced around players who know all the skills and spells ahead of time. Who know going in what they are up against. Thats great for the people who played this in early access or some such, but if you are walking into this cold, get ready to a ton of frustration. And most of the guides are dated crap, cause patches have renedered alot of them obsolete.   How long after you buy a game like this can you still get a refund? This was a huge waste of time."
Ras Ly,2,3,0,"October 2, 2017",Not Recommended,0.1,This game is so overrated.. yah it looks good and promises a lot but how can people ignore that there is basically no gameplay.. you always ether too strong or too weak for your enemys and if you dont just attack anyone in way you will get stuck in akt 1 because you wont have enough gear and exp so what point in choices if there is realy no choice.  And specialy for people who like to play sorcerers this game is almost unplayable because enemys will just teleport right to you and cc your whole team in same turn because for some reason on normal only your spells are being resisted by armor but not theirs.  Then you can just whipe your♥♥♥♥♥with your strategy because if physical rules in this game are not the same for everyone then there is no point in preparing for fight and there is no point in RPG part in that game.  You not going to enjoy it unles you like to attack anyone without thinking. And you have to realy like trolling art.. oh excuse me i mean cringy.  Bad balance.. bad economy.. broken stealing.. unlogical gamplay and constant tryes by the game to make you feel bad for your decisions.. because that is fun?!
Sarnen,122,4,4,"December 23, 2017",Not Recommended,8.5,"Game is simply too difficult, even on easier settings.  Not all of us played DOS1, or want to read an encyclopedia to play a game.  Classic and in some cases even explorer need a nerf, and new players will find this difficult, frustrating, and aggravating, because the game does such a terrible job explaining what you need, and pigeonholes you into cookie cutter min maxing just to survive the excessive difficulty.  I should point out that difficulty isn't dynamic or interesting, it's just monsters with scaled up HP/armor/damage, so fights just take longer, not become more interesting.  Story is ok but is miserably slow, intro is incredibly boring, you spend a good chunk of the early game in a ""who cares?"" mode because nothing interesting or compelling is happening.  It improves later on, though.  The only thing worse is the fanbase, which is full of ""git gud"" elitists who can't stop jerking the devs (and each other) off long enough to get over their fanboyism and admit this isn't that fun."

If you like your camera angles to make sense and for the user interface to be easy to grasp then this probably wont be a game you'll enjoy. So far I've played a tiny bit, and I know people will give me trouble for not playing very long but If within the small amount that I have played I still have no idea what's going on or what  I'm supposed to be doing that's kind of an issue. I enjoy the non hand holding to an extent but when There's no indication of anything I'm supposed to do, there's a problem.  Maybe I do need to play a bit more, but the camera's finnicky and often weird movement style makes it incredably hard to get your bearings and doesn't make me want to play to understand it. If you're looking to try it out and think that 2-3 hours is enough to know if you'll want a refund or not then I have bad news for you, It'll take about that long just to get a grasp of properly moving the camera around. Also, side note, whoever decided the default keybindings must have been drunk because come on, the buttons for the camera are all over the place."

Humility,402,2,1,"December 17, 2017",Not Recommended,6.5,"Once again I find myself in the minority.  - The camera system is archaic and claustrophobic. I can't even think of a similarly styled game that didn't utilize edge of screen orientation in the last 20 years. What is this, 1991? Having to use the home and delete keys to look around severely impedes immersion. Furthermore, it doesn't zoom out enough.  - No option to always run. In all the games I've played over the years, there was never a time where I wanted the avatar to just ""mozey"" to the desired destination. And because the camera is so claustrophobic, you have to click near the edge of the viewport to initiate the run sequence, even though you may not wish to run all the way to the edge.  It's akward and un-natural, and that destroys any chance for immersion for me personally. I'm going to try for a refund.  As for the story so far, it's cliche to the point of agitating. You start off in bondage. Have to escape. Whoah side quest go backwards and rescue poor helpless people. Yada yada. That's 8 out of 10 story lines. I just don't see how this game commanded the overwhelmingly positive reviews it has."
LaChaDerp II,161,2,1,January 4,Not Recommended,21.6,"The most intense a walking sim can get with a thick price tag.  Real Thoughts on stand out issues - After playing some more, the game is beyond linear to my PoV. The story starts and is oddly dull but the combat is somewhat cool, never have been a fan of turn based games but this one has at least some features that make it stand out. I understand this is a die hard D&D Game but everything feels like you've either done all the events correctly in this one specific order or you've been punished. The first area not being the ship but the island is a major turn off. Nothing was really impressive, your choices of things to say to everyone seemed limited and always ended up making everyone attack you if you didn't choose the correct script. That is easily the biggest issue IMO about this game. For people who are very story driven and love punishment for trying to do your own thing, this is your game. Movement is awful trying to click and move you always steal something from someone and the town again hates you, selection is buggy and has a mind of it's own, smaller things but they grow on you quickly. Trying to quest without looking everything up is also a problem. I spend more time reading the wiki page because the quest journal is lengthy like this stupid review im writing. These are some of the things that really stand out and make this a no go for me. The current price tag is also just a bit much."
Malfatto,298,9,2,"September 15, 2017",Not Recommended,13.9,"Are you a masochist that likes to try the same battle times and times again? Or perhaps you are a power gamer that have some OCD and likes to maximize everything and be the very best possible? If your answer to both is no and you just want to enjoy a good CRPG, then this game isn't for you. Not hard, unfair battles await you, unless you squeeze every bit of tactic and loot you can get. The beginning is not captivating at all, very slow and uninsteresting. I had to reload many times because often enough I would face an impossible battle. One of my characters is bugged, permanently with the wet status. There seems to be a fix that involves editing save files that who knows if will cause issues farther ahead or not. This game is for a niche group of gamers that seem to be devoted to it, its not for everyone. If you want a good CRPG with good progression and fair challenge, go play Pillars of Eternity, Tyranny or Expeditions: Vikings (though I haven't played the latter, from videos it seems good enough)."

Jim0bhab,19,2,4,September 10,Not Recommended,27.3,"Possibly the single worst experience I've ever had playing a video game.  The story is bland, uninspired, and borderline incoherent. The player is expected to have background knowledge of the game's premise prior to actually starting the story. In trying to learn what the hell was going on, I actually had to pull out my phone to consult various ""fandom"" websites to even get a hint as to what the story might actually be. Didn't even try to figure out some of the more miniscule details of the plot, less I get an aneurysm.  The writing is awkward, amateurish at best and comes off as stilted/pretentious. Dialouge choices have almost always the same outcome. The most crucial decision making often results in what can be described as a ""yes/no"" response. Even bothering to waste your time conversing with characters seems to be a blatant waste of time in the long run.  Character modeling and development is laughable. Characters often end up unimportant mary-sues with the same face and clothing. Those who aren't reused assets try way too hard to be unique, resulting in characters so aggravating that they're better left off dead than alive. I've seen better character creation options in Final Fantasy I. Final Fantasy I characters are also more expressive, even though they're pixelated.  The voice acting is masterful. That being said, it seems the entiriety of the game is voiced by about four people. Even characters physically next to each other often have the same voice actors. The narrator of the game helps to destroy any immersion and often serves as an effective deterrent against players, who might conscientiously decide not to do certain things lest they trigger this bastard's voice lines.  The gameplay is standard at best. Turn-based combat that while polished, brings absolutley nothing new or imaginative to the table. Generic armor, combat, and magic scaling that encourages anything but a ""diverse"" playstyle. The combat has about as much ""depth"" as some old school NES games did. Difficulty is widely adjustable. Inventory management is simple and uncomplicated. Crafting system might as well not exist. Attempting to play multiplayer results in a kick from a disgruntled host.  The game has little to no bugs. The game will occasionally crash at startup, but this is a minor setback that can be overcome by restarting the client. The game's collision detection and geometry is top-notch. Physics, particles, and graphics overall are pretty. Game is well-optimized. Color pallettes are appropriate and are able to adequatley set the mood for various landscapes. The landscapes of the game although, are about as uninspired as the game's characters, dialouge, combat and story.  The developers are unable to take criticism, going so far as to harass people on message boards for simply not liking their game. The developers do release new patches and content over time however, most of what is currently being added and fixed arguably should've been implemented in the game when it debuted. Error reporting is present and comes off as unintrusive.  The game is compatible with steam workshop mods, which is a big plus in my book.  Overall I could not reccommend this game to anyone and I feel as though the game shouldn't even be considered for play, even if it was free. One of the most un-fun experiences I've ever had playing a video game."
Subspace Dandy,293,8,2,"September 17, 2017",Not Recommended,11.4,"EDIT: okay, since the fanboys descended upon this review like a rabid dislike-wielding horde of digital huns, I'll provide one example of why this is a bad roleplaying game.  Early on you kill an opressive prison bigshot and his gang (which is, incidentally, about half the civilian population of the starting village). The guy supposedly held the settlement in an iron grip by controlling distribution of food.   What changes after his death? Nothing. Literally nothing. Not even a single comment from the liberated, except one line from the quest giver. Guards continue to patrol the corpse-stewn yard, wading through actual pools of blood.    At this point I'd like to remind you that we are discussing a game universally praised for its systemic approach and reactivity.  I rest my case.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Yeah, no.   - The worldbuilding is painfully uninspiring - The fabled reactivity amounts to a couple of cosmetic dialog options here and there plus several gimmicks (stealing faces, talking to cows, putting out fire with water) - Biggest problem: it is a game about turn-based combat where combat means yawn-inducing ability spam and camera wrestling - The graphics are nice, I guess   It's the first Dragon Age all over again, minus cringey romance plus less interesting fights. Can't believe I'm saying this, but even the current crop of faux-Infinity RPGs is better.   Then again, maybe I'm just getting old."

No prompts to ask you if you actually wanna do an action, no instruction that you probably shouldn't be clicking on things unless you plan to die, and apparently there's a sneak mode too which they only tell you about after you steal something. At least in DND you get to say ""I steal the book off the pedastal!"" I mean even RuneScape has a pop up menu so you can choose what you wanna do.  In response to someone telling me to right click:  I mean, left clicking being steal by default is stupid. I figured out right clicking it works now so I can actually read it but after going into the next area I died again because apparently even if you sneak properly and steal something without anyone noticing it leaves a ""crime scene"" behind that basically means they'll just say you look like a thief then kill you. And of course the game only tells you that AFTER you steal something.  Not only that but the game keeps breaking. It broke multiple times in character creation so I had to restart over and over and then in a battle against the person I stole from the game broke again. It was the enemy's turn and they were just walking around me then returned to positions a bit away from me but still battle ready then sat there until I closed the game.  The chat system is garbage too. you have to hit enter to open it, enter to send the message, and enter to close it. The whole game is really unintutive. If you go to click on the chat and you accidentally click slightly off the window you end up moving there and that includes through a door into a bunch more guards and in consumes all your action points so you're guaranteed screwed just because of how unintuitive the game is.  Horribly programmed game. Terribly unintuitive in everything.  UPDATE: I tried stealing the item again(without having to read the tool tip this time). I even went ahead and hid the item somewhere else then when I came back since there was a crime scene the girl wanted to search me so I allowed it. After allowing the search and her finding nothing she basically just says ""well you still look suspicious so I'm gonna kill you."" Like... what? So basically you can do everything perfectly in this game and people will still kill you for no reason. I mean why don't they just kill the other guards too then and everyone on the ship? Still a terrible game.  UPDATE: So I tried playing through the game without stealing things and upon getting to Magistar Williams just a few rooms over after the whole thing there I tried talking to someone and it won't let me choose options any more.

Most of your abilities are unusable until you have depleted your enemy of their armor, at which point you're better finishing them off, so all your control abilities are next to useless. The system also encourages each and every of your characters to be spread between physical and magical. Should you specialise a character, you'll be penalised for it. Finally, the graphics get tiring very quickly. Every battle has pools of liquid with lightning all over them, burning fire all over, or ice. It makes magic feel not magical at all, and it's just ugly and hard on the eyes in the end. "
tetra.hydro.cannabinol.4200,11,3,0,"September 19, 2017",Not Recommended,19.3,"I played for 14 hours trying to like this game and couldnt do it. Let me start off be saying be ware this game has NO quest log or min map markers, you are pretty much stuck in this big area with only vague glues or ideas on where you MIGHT go... As far as the combat side goes it's almost pain full to fight. You alwas feel out number and moving around during a fight is like pulling teeth. I would not recomend this any one unless you are a HARDCORE rpg player.  I would also like to sight another clear down side to this game (for me) I discovered today. Once a group of enemies is killed there is no respawn for them, witch basically means you will never be able to grind for levels and gear. I guess this is ok if your just playing to hear a story but if your farmer and enjoy grinding you will be sadly let down.  I am leaving this review up and not changing a thing, alot of people who knew what they where buying and are fans of the DOS series have had some pretty harsh criticisms on my review witch is fine.  About a dozen people have flamed me for not doing enough resreach about the game, honestly when I did read steam reviews about the game  along with a couple sights including ING and Gamestop, I never found one that mentioned any of these  qualities. I wish I had!"

Pros: The ability to set the number of quick- and auto-saves; Visual character customization; The option to turn off the VA.  Cons: Multiplayer-focused; Combat encounters - enemies appear out of thin air; There is no pause button, neither is possible to speed up the game; AI and bugs - a quest NPC stepped into poison and the whole area became hostile; Combat balance; The lack of roleplay - there are 2-3 types of answers - ""good"", ""evil"", origin; A lot of RNG'ed loot, including quest rewards; VA is annoying; Camera is uncomfortable to control, controls in general are irresponsive; Attempts at humor are irritating. Update The companions, who are not in the active party, die after escaping Fort Joy; Progression - you have to complete the majority of side quests or you will be under-leveled for the main ones, which makes following the critical path unnecessary hard."

The game just spirals downwards after the first two acts. There's a lot of content but very little of it is actually worth it. Fights are either boringly easy or just stupidly hard as 80% of the combat is about positioning and exploiting the AI. After a while it's simply unfun, the only real suspense this game brings is hoping your quests don't just randomly bug out, A 60 hour game padded with 40 hours of backtracing, reloads and getting lost in the clunky, cluttered and buggy windows and inventory.

You are offered many choices, though you have only one right answer.  Ordinary animals all have exotic and jarring magic powers that make no sense. Alligators, despite what you might expect, have the ability to teleport other and summon powerful meteors from the heavens. Probably other powers too, but I wasn't strong enough to fight them. Other creatures all seemingly have these exotic and nonsensical abilities, though I wasn't strong enough to fight them either.  The characters aren't really all that interseting or likeable. One of them attacks you, and you're given the option of being a total ♥♥♥♥♥, or fighting and killing her. I killed her. She dead, there goes one of the main characters. Oh, and you need her in order to progress, as the game expects you to have her, or you aren't strong enough to tackle encounters, so I guess that's game over.  I liked the first one, and I wanted to like this one. It too had the open world can go where you please, as you please, but you have to do fights in this specific order, and win through this specific strat. While not my favor, it wasn't a deal breaker.  What was a deal breaker was the animals having such insanely powerful magic. It just broke immersion completely. I don't understand how alligators can summon your party members to them and then drop meteors on them. These were not gator-men, ancient wizards from a lost age or anything. Just random lizards on the shore. Oher monsters were all the same. It completely ruined my suspension of disbelief."
Spud the Spud,215,6,1,"September 15, 2017",Not Recommended,5.4,"I'm pretty disappointed so far.  I spent over an hour dealing with an odd crash to desktop bug when trying to open the options menu. Not awesome.  Party size is 4. But you can only create one from the ground up, having to take what they give you for the remainder (select 1 of 4 preset options each). I find that they're not built the way I like, with starting talents and skills. Anyway, putting together a party from the available classes feels awkward, clunky, unpleasant, and unable to fill out the party in a manner I'd like with less than 5 (or two built from scratch, as with the first game).  Wasn't a cheap game, so I suppose I'll keep playing and trying to make it work, after starting over from scratch to try to compensate for the party with the one character I can fully design. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have bought the game, it's a waste of my gaming budget. Thus far, it's nowhere near as fantastic as the first game was, and I'm completely disappointed. Hopefully it'll get better later, but it's off to a rough start and I'm not optimistic.  First game was incredible. This one has yet to impress me in any way.  Edit: Gave it another hour. Still bad. Had I not been stuck with that crash bug, and the solo mission (in other words, the waste of time stuff before being able to start assembling a group and experiencing how bad this game is) I would have refunded this game.  0/10. That's as a long time lover of RPGs. This is garbage. I wouldn't, knowing what I know now, buy it on sale for even one dollar. Incidentally, I have 82 hours played with the first game."

The default RNPC skills on level are very bad, and that handicaps the early game - though, of course that ends up being less of a bother around the time you get out of the first non-tutorial area (Fort Joy).  Because of the heavy RNG in the loot aspect of the game, there's no reliable way to get good enough gear to handle all the various shenanigans that the enemies will throw at you - and, on hard or ironman mode, they'll throw a lot of shenanigans your way.  But then suddenly you'll gear up and combats will swing hugely and go from either interesting or too hard (so much RNG reliance! If I wanted to play XCOM I'd just play that, thanks) to boring or too easy.  Backed this game on Kickstarter for the CE because of how much I enjoyed the first D:OS game; put 80-90 hours in the first one, co-op, plus another 50+ single-player.  Didn't even hit ten hours on this game before uninstalling.  What a disappointing way to follow-up one of the best co-op RPGs in recent memory."

I find a bow, recruit the Red Prince, and accidently shoot him the face. Go to some gates, some people blow some lizardwoman up, I eat her body to get a memory of some dude who escaped. Then I realized the Red Prince was still at the rock I met him at. He just decided not to follow me, I guess. I walk around, find Fane the undead dude. Walk around more, meet some turtles who try to kill me. The Red Prince decided to stop following me again, so it's just me and Fane. Kill them, loot their stuff. Go to city, meet some people, do some missions, get told about an underground tunnel. go to tunnel, but it's 'guarded' by a ghoul or something. He wipes me twice.

Go to cave, fire slugs want to talk to me, I can't understand them, they attack me. I accidently shoot and kill the Red Prince and quit the game and request refund.  ---  I'm usually pretty decent at games, and can figure out how to play pretty quickly. I mean, I've been playing video games since I was 5. This game, though, is overly complicated to the point of insanity. You have to micromanage everything, and sometimes the game just throws a curveball at you you'll never expect. Like why is my left click suddenly attack instead of walk, or vice versa? I don't know and it doesn't explain it. An Assassin comes up looking for the Red Prince and wipes your party in two turns? Cool, why not. Party member decides not to move and you get in a fight with one party member 200 yards away? Yeah, that's a thing. It just doesn't make sense.  There are positives. The combat, when it works, is pretty good. It's solid turn based combat. It is kinda infuriating when you try to shoot an enemy and your character, for no real reason, decides to walk towards them through fire and poison, but apparently you have to deal with that. Loot make sense, even if it isn't explained very well. The crafting is cool and doesn't seem to have any negatives. The trading is pretty cool. Instead of saying ""Item X costs 40g"" it's ""Item X is worth 40g"". You can offer your own items and gold to buy it. If you want to buy boots worth 5g, you can offer up a 3g book and  2g to buy it. If you offer, say, a 10g book for it, the merchant will like you more. Pretty cool.  Overall, I can't recommend the game. It's just way too complicated. Not for the sake of fun, it seems, but just for the sake of making the game harder. I'm all for hard games, but this one doesn't make any sense.

This game is like a cross between Baldor's Gate, Wrold of Warcraft, and Skyrim. Except the graphics pale in comparison to Skyrim, and the UI and logic in the game are not as good as WoW.   There are some simple bugs STILL in this game. For example, when your party members are separated far apart and/or on completely different maps, you can still share inventory items with them as if they were right there next to you! Another bug is that sometimes main characters in the story act as if they've never seen you before, when you in fact have met them many times. Add to that the sometimes extreme difficulty finding even the simplest tools (such as a shovel) needed to complete the story, and very little guidance in the game for how to create and acquire better items other than a stick with a nail on it, or twigs and string for a bow, and you got yourelf a game not nearly worth the money you paid for it!  By the way, multiplayer in WoW was far better than in this game. There is no voice (mic support) in this game, only chat.

I'm not sure why that's the case, but I'm going to assume Larian Studios thought it would be better to reinvent the wheel instead of implimenting a feature from an old game into what appears to be the same exact engine (just more aesthetically pleasing).  On that note, the Larian Studios has been largely unresponsive to inquiries on a local splitscreen feature for months.  ----------------------------------------------------  UPDATE:  I'm aware they intend to implement controller support and splitscreen coop functionality to their game.  They're not giving us updates as to when to expect that.  I am rating it negatively because it currently doesn't support it.  Their assets are prettier, their menus are probably more intuitive, but the engine is largely the same.  It certainly shouldn't warrant having to wait this long for controller support, even as an Early Access game.  I bought (and got a refund) for this game because I assumed it would have these features.  I mean, this game uses the same engine they refined to support this.  I don't buy into the whole, ""We'd have to keep fixing it after every update"" or ""We just don't have the time.""    I just want them to say, ""We decided to waste time and resources to rebuild a new engine that does exactly the same stuff. (Reinvent the wheel)""  Don't get me wrong, I fully intend to purchase this game when it has these features.  Besides, it's not like I can't just change the review when splitscreen coop and controller support is implemented.

ElektroFCK,137,7,2,"September 23, 2017",Not Recommended,2.1,"Overrated. No german speakers -> too much text to read. Story is pretty generic so far. Elven, dwarfes, humans - knights, assasins and magicians etc.  The arrogant lizard prince, the rough dwarf, the mysterious elven etc strand all togehter on an island and group up. yawn.   Top down view takes away a lot of atmosphere. Its not a bad game, but highly overrated by steam fanboys and critics.   I enjoy roleplaying games but i wont recommend this game to all, especially not for full price. Dont expect a Witcher 3, which gives u the WOW effect and blows u away - thats what steam fanboy reviews promise you here atm and reviews by ign etc and i was fooled by them.   The fight system is fine, i dont have a problem with this slow paced tactic thing.   Its a good and solid rpg for oldschool rpg fans. But i expected much more reading some reviews. If this should be the best rpg of 2017, its a bad year for the rpg genre."

You can tell they spent a lot of money and time on the decor.  Here is a review of my meal  Course 1: Perfectly cooked steak.  Tasted sublime and left me wanting more.  Course 2: Mashed potatoes.  Serving size was twice that of the steak, but still quite tasty even if it left me a little bloated.  Course 3: The cook threw a rusty can of green beans at my head from the kitchen.  I kept banging the can against the table until It opened and tried to choke down the food inside multiple times, but couldn’t quite keep it down.  Course 4: I could see from my table a dog ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on a plate in the kitchen and saw the chef sprinkling powdered sugar on it with a card labeled dessert.  I immediately stood up and left.

Every fight you get in will go like this: You take 1 turn on a char, the enemy all take 2, you take another turn on a different party member, the enemy all take 2. AOE everywhere, everything casts decay, you hover over an enemy, confirm that tooltip is an enemy, cast spell and it hits your ally. The difficulty changes make little sense, even the difference between the lowest and next highest for settings has issues from being far too easy to being 2 shotted. Line of Sight doesn't always apply to the AI, even for direct attacks. The game is more about wasting your time than gameplay.  This game is majorly flawed in it's actual design.  To put it in a better perspective, since steam has the dumbest version of ""yes or no"" reccomendations I would say 6.5/10."

At one point I was able to get past Character Creation mode but I had to pick the character very quickly and had no problems playing the game then. I just cant stay in C.C. and read all the talents and options available for me to pick. There seems to be a problem with the game crashing after ""X"" amount of time in C.C. I have tried to create a character 3 different times to no avail. The best description i can provide of the game crashing is my whole computer would freeze in C.C. (there is no specific point during C.C. that makes it crash, its just being in C.C. for too long casues the game to crash after a few minutes). I cant Alt-Tab, CLTR -ALT-Delete, and the only way to respoind is by doing a force shut down of my computer. After rebooting my computer the PC will then persist in going into a seemingly endless repair boot by constantly restarting. I would then pull the plug out of the outlet and wait for 10-15min and try again where it will reboot successfully. At first I thought it was my computer and not the game, but I am capable of playing other games some of which are more hardware intensive for hours. I would try to figure this problem out but I fear the constant turning on and off of my computer willpotentially damage my components."

Even when fighting enemies of the same level, you will die a lot - save often!  Quests are all over the place, certainly not a linear game, but this can lead you into areas where you have no chance of winning a single battle,  You will find locked doors or areas requiring a key or item from someplace halfway across the map - that you dont even have a quest for.  It seems the idea of this game is to simply wander aimlessly, and return to places you got stuck on if you happen accross the item you needed.  Finally, be preparred to talk to every single NPC.  You will spend way more time walking and talking than actually battling, but at least you wont die as often when talking.

The Mute Cynic,"3,225",10,2,"September 21, 2016",Not Recommended,45.4,"​​​Early Access Watcher Reviews  Update Version: 2.0.165.341  Disclosure: This game copy was bought by the reviewer. I have not participated in the Kickstarter for this game and only heard about it upon release on Steam.  Full Review: https://www.gatewaytogaming.com/divinity--original-sin-ii.html (Note: Had to remove first two paragraphs due to limitations)  Gameplay Footage (Spoilers of first hour): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEMTem3wiXk  Walking along the shoreline within the first few minutes, it is clear how detailed the environments in the game are. Texture quality is some of the best I have seen for foliage and building detail. Character models have a great look to them (lizards are simple gorgeous), but armor quality appears blurry at times, ranging from shimmering to ""still rendering"" dull. The way characters move in combat is another story though, sporting some great attack animations. Spell animations highlight the superior usage of particle effects, especially with the way the pyrotechnics and surface changes from spells were taken into account. Just a quick note on the sound department; music is great, if not a bit bland, but it does help fill the void left by the lack of voice-acting. Ambient sounds is decent, nothing special, but it gets the job done. Damp caves, lush jungles, and decrepit forts are all rendered well and are beautifully crafted set pieces for the possible battles some poorly chosen words inevitably initiate.   While the possibility to avoid battles is high due to a wide selection of dialog opportunities, it is not entirely avoidable. Everything is controlled by the use of actions points that replenish each turn or by the use of certain abilities. Movement, skills (with added cool downs), items, and looting all require these points and can cause the player to either horde AP for a future turn if they so desire. Equipment also dictates how much magic armor or armor on goes into battle with, soaking up blows from spells and attacks respectably before losing health. One system in particular that stands out is the environmental status effects such as frozen, stunned, or petrified. Stun multiple enemies by casting Rain and using a shock ability or cast hail to freeze an area that becomes prone to slipping (knocked down). It is a simple idea that makes battles even more tactical and much easier given the surprising difficulty of some of the fights.  While I managed to steamroll through my second playthrough on Exploration Mode, the Classic Mode does offer a couple of difficult fights. Part of this issue could stem from the extremely powerful starter abilities and the relative health amount from certain enemies. One spell was powerful enough (in both power and distance) to allow me to farm tougher opponents without entering combat. I ended up murdering everyone in Fort Joy without dying due to this spell and only found death once at the hand of the final boss. This also allowed me to complete the first Act on Classic in 7 hours while also completing plenty of side content (again, side-stepping by the use of this particular skill). It feels like an exploit to use this skill, but with some spell balancing and enemy distance detection fixes it might not be much of an issue. Outside of this, the final boss is tough as nails and there are plenty of scenarios with ""instant death"" outcomes. It is a challenging experience, but thankfully certain dialog options can side-step combat while introducing new story material.  Dialog plays a definitive role and results can vary depending on plenty of pre-requisites. Certain people will refuse to talk to lizards while others will not provide information unless a specific tag is used. A dwarf in Fort Joy, for instance, reacted positively to one of my party members due to a history they shared and through this conversation an item was produced and some lore was provided. Other cases are just an example of good dialog selection, apparent when dealing with the slugs in the hidden passage or the guard you meet further down the line. Persuasion also helps to deter tense scenarios, relying on stat warfare (stat >=< opponent stat) + persuasion to determine the outcome. All of these dialog routes add multiple ways to deter combat and benefit the roleplaying options already provided by the game's darker tone. It essentially made my second playthrough (this time on Exploration Mode) less reliant on combat, finishing the first Act in five hours.   The story this time around revolves around the Divine being dead and the voidwoken's numbers increasing due to the use of Source magick. As a ""sourcerer,"" the player is taken to Fort Joy to be ""cured"" of their curse, awarded a stylish collar to block the magick. Shipwrecked and alone, the player awakens on the shore and soon discovers the only salvation in sight is inside a camp run by the devout of the departed Lucian. This is the setting of a deeply troubling scenario that mixes an unknown protagonist amidst plenty of mentally scarred individuals and a questionable authority purely on the basis of paranoia. It opens up further as other NPCs join to hopefully escape the unknown consequences of conforming and most of it is well-written, including several side quests that range from disturbing to outright sickening. I have always been a fan of the more macabre settings and enjoyed what was on offer so far. Some of it is cliche, which at this point is hard to avoid, but the overall struggle is one I greatly approve of.  Being in alpha, there is bound to be issues creeping around in the cellar. When climbing vines (specifically the one lowered by someone later on), the current character will climb it normally, but the other party members will not climb it. During combat, the game pauses on the current character (with no AP) and seems to delay a good 10-15 seconds before it moves on to the next person in the rotation. Graphical issues can sneak up as well (helmet hidden removes hair, floating weapons, enemies clipping) as well as the obvious crashes that plague most early access games. Does it excuse it? Of course not.   While none of the following issues are deal breakers, they are quality of life issues that can make the experience rather annoying. Inventory items must be dragged to other slots in order to organize them and the system could really use a auto-sort feature. The camera can be very stingy when trying to zoom out and has a very limited scope that can make moving in some areas absolutely frustrating. There is no real direction in terms of locating the next objective, especially at the beginning. This last point isn't an issue for me (actually found it refreshing), but some areas might require loading a save file (Rex's Castle) due to an inability to leave.   My sword has been pierced into the shoreline of Fort Joy twice with a grand total of 12 hours between both play throughs. I spent a little time testing out the Arena mode on the 4p map to ensure it was functional, but it left a very weak impression on me. The main story felt a bit cliched, but the ominous vibes surrounding the campaign left me intrigued enough to play through it. I loved some of the side quests (never kiss a stranger) and applaud the colorful aesthetic for contrasting the depressing mode without feeling awkward. The bottom line, however, is too thin to support the hefty price tag for what is essentially a demo. I cannot recommend Divinity: Original Sin II at this time. Larian Studios has a successful history with early access and I hope to see how there second time around turns out when I come back to update my review upon full release.   Pros  - Visually impressive - Great combat - Story (what there is of it) is decent with a macabre overtone - Few great side quests   Cons - Content lite  - Crashes - Sound assets need work"

OR2008,0,2,14,September 13,Not Recommended,172.5,"Don't get this game.  I spent over 100 hours trying to figure out what to do and I never got off the first Island. Everything in this game is veiled in complexity hidden behind layers of convolution. Nothing in this game is straight forward - which isn't a problem - but the game doesn't explain anything. The wiki is just as bad - which tells me the developers were making this game for a specific audience already familiar with their product, or they themselves created a monster and didn't know how to deal with it so they released it unto the world.  Quest logs are organized haphazardly, on-screen notification don't stay on screen long enough, characters are bland at best and downright annoying at worst. You have to walk around with left alt depressed or you won't be able to see anything. Nothing on screen is viewable and so you might miss that key placed right next to the door on that ship...  What was really annoying for me was that there weren't any dedicated traders in game. You have to remember to barter with everyone you meet since they could have something of value and then remember where they are located because you won't have anywhere near the amount of money you need to buy basic survival items. A little tip: don't spend money on weapons - buy tons of armor and spells.  The combat. Jesus Christ, the combat. It's so bad. The player gets to choose from a dozen or so classes, but don't you dare! Don't even think about choosing a non-magic build. Raw physical damage will get you nowhere. Oh yeah, every enemy has at least 2 health bars, sometimes three: Physical health, armor and magic. Mages will have more magic armor than physical, melee characters will have more physical than magical, so you have to attack each accordingly. At level 7, I have to do upward of 200 freaking damage to kill something. What?! That's insanity. The combat is so convoluted and overly complex. Why do I have to create these exaggerated, synergistic combos to get anywhere? I mean, there are 12, TWELVE! different types of surfaces. Are you serious?! TWELVE? GTFOH! I get that understanding this stuff can be rewarding, but it shouldn't take 100 hours to do that. If a developer wants people to play their game, accessibility has to exist somewhere in the game. In this game, it doesn't exist.  The AI. GD AI! Always focuses on one character - the weakest - and they manage to kill them in 3 turns. My DPS is stupid low compared to enemies that are supposed to be the same level. I'm guessing enemies scale in this game since I never fought anything higher leveled. Scrolls are required to resurrect characters, which you'll be needing tons of btw since healing is so scarce. Enemies seem to have tons of AP. I once had an enemy move halfway across the screen, cast a spell and attack on the same turn. Come on. Nothing about this game's combat system makes sense in a traditional risk/reward system. You're penalized heavily for taking risks and penalized heavily for not deviating from hack n slash. This game wants you to play perfectly. Every. Time.   If you do decide to get this game - first have your head examined, then, seriously, sit the F down and map out the kind of character you want. Everything about the character. I mean EVERYTHING. Look at the skills, the attributes and abilities. EVERYTHING!  Or, just don't get this game. That'd be better."
Netograt,2,3,2,"September 25, 2017",Not Recommended,52.7,"SCAM! This game has amazing online reviews that I can only assume after playing it are staged because it is not possible for so many people to have posted reviews that are inaccurate. This means there is serous catfishing involved, the people clicked on the worng game for the review or I'm not in my right mind. While the graphics are nice to look at the interface and playabillity are terrable. Movement is difficult especially out doors. Items are commonly very difficult to see and the tool that was built in to make it easy to see the items (left alt key) while showing some items it does not work for most. The game waypoint system failed. When you reached waypoints and game play paused showing it was saving but no save point was created. It is very difficult to determine who allies are in some combat scenarios. This is just a trainwreck of a game, but wait it gets better. How is this possible you ask..... This game is advertised as multiplayer and as a multiplayer game it is almost unplayable. Typically the software developer will blaim this on your connection quallity, however, in my cast that would be hard to do since the other player and I are both connected on gigabit Fiber internet connections. We for other reasons transfer large files of a secure nature to eachother so there is monitoring software involves that tracks connection quallity and speed as well as verifies it is secure. My reporting shows no issues with connectivity speed or quallity. Moving on... My view of the game as the organizer was fair, but the player I was playing with was dealing with horrific lag, random movements and actions. This is one of only a couple games I have ever owned I wish I had never purchased. I only played for a total of 8 or so hours but according to steam I had just under 53 hours played since purchasing it Saturday afternoon. This is because I exited the game 3 times but it never logged out, right before writing this review I discovered it WAS STILL RUNNING!!! and had to restart my PC to make it go away. I was so disappointed by this game because I was looking forward to the release for over a year... ;-(  "

Decoy,77,22,8,"September 8, 2017",Not Recommended,56.1,"I bought this game after seeing the enhanced multiplayer options allowing infighting between players.  It sounded awesome.    My problem with this game is you have no real character unless you are hosting games.  You simply jump into other players games and use the NPC characters.  If the host plays without you then someone else runs your character.    The fact everyone is effectively anonymous and you have no attachment to your character ruins this game.  It allows trolls to poison you even if they never see it.  Half the players kick people from open games within seconds for this reason.  (not sure why they have the game set to open in the first place)  Even if you join a game with friendly players you can be left with playing any of the classes at random for a completely unknown amount of time.  I guess my point is the multiplayer in this game is♥♥♥♥♥♥ entirely built for trolls.  The single player story is interesting so far, but I am not going to reccomend it due to the terrible multiplayer experience.  I can't see myself playing through the story more than once.  edit:  Lol these comments are crazy.  To the ""play an RPG with randoms people"" Yes I bought the game expecting to play like most other RPGs.  Diablo 3, Path of Exile, even dark souls are all RPGs with multiplayer.  It is not some game breaking idea.  Playing together is like herding cats.  It would be about as hard as getting a DnD group together and much less fun.  No one can play if the host (dm) is not there.  DM can kick and reload games at will.      To the people saying the devs said you should play with friends.  That should be a banner on the main page.  Random multiplayer games are simply not a fun experience.  People should know that.    Please view this game as a solo game or herd all your friends to meet up for an RPG every week.  Edit 2:  For me Steam is simply for buying and launching games.  Ive been on here since the orange box.  If the fact I use steam to play games and not keep a social media game diary makes you want to ignore my opinion then by all means ignore it.    I see that kind of immediate personal attack as a fanboy tactic since you cannot combat the truth in the review.  DOS2 has a terrible public multiplayer system.  If it had normal multiplayer I would see myself playing hundreds of hours, going through the story multiple times on multiple characters, jumping into friends games and playing with them.  Jumping in random games and talking to people and taking a back seat as they take care of (and probably murderhobo) the story.  Instead I will play through the game once more on single player after the release where you are not simply escaping the island to a suddent abrupt end like the alpha.   The single player game is not bad.  Tons of things to do, plenty of side quests, loads of (text based) dialogue which at times was way way too much for simple things.  Easy enough when it comes to stratagies and skills.  Even unexpected feelings, torturing people is one thing, but that poor bear cub :( I tried to revive the mom with a scroll, but couldnt.  I should be able to revive the mom!  Final edit for launch:   The last wave of balancing made the game a lot nicer for single player.  Sadly stealthing really only works well on multi player due to party leashing system.  They should have stolen the solo mode from KOTOR.    If you plan on buying this for a single player story you will probably enjoy it.  If you want hundreds of hours of multiplayer fun and endless replays this game is not for you."

I was so excited to play this game and thought this would be something like Skyrim but 10 times better. Here is what I found after playing for just 2 hours.   The camera angle is ridiculous. You are looking down upon your character from around a 45 degree angle. I am constantly trying to look ahead or up but you simply can't. It is like driving a car but you keep getting pulled into the ditch. So frustrating. If you zoom the camera in everthing surrounding your immediate field of view becomes blurry. Zooming out so you can actually see a little bit of what is going on around you makes everything so small. I am playing on a 27 inch monitor and my character is less than an inch tall.   I absolutely hate the combat system. In the first fight the game just took complete control of the fight. I couldn't move. I had no idea what was going on. There is no freedom whatsoever to attack or move freely as you wish.   The narrative is so boring. Every single person you encounter leads to a dialogue and the narrator pops open this huge box right in the middle/top of your screen. I wanted to play a game, not read a book.  I changed my settings for audio/video etc. The next time I started the game they had all reverted back to the default settings.   I can't believe that so many people are claiming this to be the best RPG of the decade. I have played Skyrim, Fallout 4, Dragon age inquisition and loved them all. I simply can't play this game.

Though I am an RPG buff, there's a limit how much 'RP' I want in my RPG.  I don't have time nor want to spend 5 minutes on every conversation with an NPC.  Playing this game is like reading a book, except it's sluggish book that you have to stop for a minute every time you turn a page.  I run up, talk to an NPC spend 5 mins picking/reading all choices , he tells me what to do, I spin around to head towards objective, have to adjust camera cause I cant see the door(half the time my view is obstructed by a wall or structure), and  once I can see the door, I awkwardly walk/run as the movement feels glitchy as my character randomly stops/starts running, and I try to get him through the door.

Shujin,21,7,22,"September 16, 2017",Not Recommended,32.1,"Would not recommend this game. Most boring RPG I have ever played.  Played with 3 friends and it took 2 hours of game time to even get out of the intro and get to the first city so there goes my chance for a refund before the game even starts.  Combat is painfully slow playing with 4 people and the story was excruciatingly boring.  Sometimes combat was 3 or more hours between and I was struggling to stay awake, the only reason i continued to play was because it was coop and I could play with some friends.  One of my friends increased the difficulty from normal to hard and the rest of the time playing after that was spent strategically avoiding combat because it was too difficult for our team or we were severely outnumbered and would be wiped out in a single round.  We attempted to change it back to a more suitable difficulty so we could participate in combat more often, but apparently we could only change the difficulty once and now we are stuck in a role-playing game too afraid to get in to combat or be faced with instant death.  The graphics were nice, the spell effects were decent and I even liked the landscape - unfortunately it takes much more than that to make the game enjoyable and my experience with divinity was so unbearable I spent most of my time in the game watching movies while my team scolded me in discord for getting lost, falling behind and dying to traps.  A majority of the time playing was spent mindlessly following my team until we eventually got to a boss fight (which were so far and few inbetween it wasn't worth the wait). It wouldn't have been so bad if the follow feature wasn't disabled in coop so I could have just auto-followed them until combat started.  The jokes were lame and there was nothing comedic or funny about anything they said.   As far as I'm concerned this is a solo game that you should really play alone and should be played like a book. Expect minimum gameplay unless you enjoy looting worthless items, speaking to boring npcs or just clicking around the map mindlessly navigating areas."
mcramer451,32,5,5,"October 13, 2017",Not Recommended,150.5,DO NOT BUY!!!!!    I’ve been playing these types of games for literally 20 years and I’ve never been so outright frustrated and bored at the same time with any game until I ran into this one. If there is a way I could get my money back for this game I would happily do it – and then burn it dollar by dollar. I would’ve had more fun that way.  Yes I have looked at all the YouTube videos on how to min max a character. Yes I have followed all the cheat guides and walk-throughs. Yes I have followed all of the hints and guides on how to get through difficult areas.  Every fight – and I mean every fight – feels like I’m five levels below where I should be even when the characters are equal level to the baddies that I am fighting. I die repeatedly even saving in between each section and step of a fight that I’m taking. If this is how the entire game is supposed to be run in order to even complete getting to Act II – this game needs a serious fix. This is not fun – this is not the way a game is meant to be played.  I’m tired of dying. I’m tired of playing and not getting anywhere for wasting three hours of my life.  I’m tired of not doing enough damage and having them take all of my armor and then half of my life in one hit. Yes by the way I am even doing the stupid stealing from all the merchants and getting the best crap cheat.  Do not ever buy this game – do not ever buy this game on sale – do not ever accept this game as a gift.   I wish i could have all the hours i have put into this gmae back - i'll miss them on my deathbed....

As for the story I haven't gotten through any because it's just boring. The amount of hard walls I've hit are utterly depressing. The forced NPCs you get to control are completely cookie cutter tropes forced into the game. Also you can't say no to these NPCs because then you lose any combat you get into!

All of the fights are too difficult and there are no additional ways for me to get experience to level up to be able to progress through the fights... I can't say I've ever ran into this before.  The fights themselves aren't any fun either. 90% of the fights will go as follows... Your group walks into a fight situation in a tight grouping. The fight starts, the enemies will have the initiative and they will immediate start hitting you with AOE nukes that you can't avoid because your group insists on entering the fight standing two steps apart from each other. There isn't any way to adjust the grouping, initiate the fight with a single member or avoid the AOE.   Playing this game is like repeatedly being forced to walk into a trap you can see coming from a mile away.

Glenjamin,220,No,0,June 21,Not Recommended,56.4,this game feels like it was written and designed by a ten year old. every bit of the story feels convoluted and hard to follow every fight even the very beginning ones feel long drawn out and have unecessary mechanics. like why does a salt water crocodile shoot a flaming ball of napalm at me makes no damn sense? randomly one of your companions will go full spastic  and attack someone especially lohse who just decides to channel ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s  and attack a rando at the worst possible time. oh and you are basically in rags in the beginning you have to fight groups of 3 to 4 monsters and to top it off the combat system is clunky and always allows friendly fire oh and you can chain elements   but literally none of the combat information is given to you....so you just find out random nonsense. some makes sense like wet and lightning dont mix but the fact one of your companions is healed by poison and its never mentioned and you accidentally kill him is god damn irritating.  on top of this the story is just terrible and hard to follow makes you feel like you have to play the first game no explanation is given of whats going on wtf is source wtf are godwoken wtf are the monsters they summon when they use the source?  i mean its playable but they clearly bought the good reviews they have  because in no way shape or form is this a great game.  oh and healing sucks so you can do fine if you have health potions but again not explained you could probably buy some but the vendors arent marked  their is holding my hand and their is giving me no information at all and telling me to go fly a kite and thats what this game does.  a good concept ruined by ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanics and random story twists that arent necessary and usually annoy the hell out of you  on top of none sensical enemy mechanics and no real tutorial on how anything works at all.  in short half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥badly thought out game decisions that effectively make this an over priced and over hyped turd.

First of all, you can't fight, your character is just stuck and everyone has to take turns to kill one and another. What is this, baby time? Second, it's shamelessly unrealistic. The graphics are so bad. The music SUCKS, honestly, they should have just used pandora radio instead of weird old people music.   Sorry Divinity creators, but magic isn't actually real. The story is also very shallow, cliche and stupid, its about this: You are special, you are a wizard harry, you are the true jedi Luke, etc. same cliche, except it's 'godwoken'.   This game is honestly the worst RPG of all time. Save your money and buy Citadel: Forged with Fire, a vastly superior game in every respect."

Horrid,187,7,5,"September 16, 2017",Not Recommended,6.2,"So dissapointed, was on the fence to buy this as I was not impressed with the first one. I was told by friends that this one resolved all the issues of the first, it did not. If anything this one is 5X worse, at minimum.  They say the game has ""tactics"", but the only tactic that works is bugging out the AI so you can isolate enemies and use all 4 of your team vs 1.  Im about 5-7 fights in, and I am completely stuck, i have 3 different fights I can do, but they all result in the same outcome unless i resort to cheese to try and win.  At least the fights in the 1st weren't so 1 sided, and you could have a tactical fight. Even with the other fights I won without being cheezy, i still did not win any humanoid fights without having to reload my game 2 - 3 times, sneak in chars and unchain them into positions. If i wanted to play memory games I would go buy a ♥♥♥♥ing deck of cards.   Wanna kick myself for even trying this at full price.  On the other side a few other cons, the armor looks odd on almost all char models. The char models / portraits look like they were rushed, more like clay statues with no life.  The voice acting is very good, but that so far is the one saving grace, this game needs patches, and the combat needs serious work.  For shame, for shame.   *Edit - I would petition for a refund if i weren't already 4 hours over the steam time frame."

Seems dodgy as hell because the game is bloody terrible :(  I really have to be missing something here, like some others who left negative reviews also and couldn't figure out why so many others are giving it such positive reviews.  Also, for anyone with the Nvidia Shield TV box and streaming the game to it for 2 player local co-op splitscreen, it works but it doesn't work very well. First player (main controller) controls the screen movement and the splitscreen itself is very cumbersome and flaky (when it actually works) - could do with some serious improvements. It's a good feature though but it falls apart because the game is an RPG, like an old Amiga game with multiple text options in old 1980's style and it just plays awful for the purpose of local co-op splitscreen.  Ah well, back to The Witcher III, where at least the graphics don't look like something from the 80's. "

If you a fan of this series, you should pick it up, but for someone looking for a new turn based game, I would not recommend. I'm sure people who love this genre would find this  great game, but for someone like me, who likes all types of games equally, there was nothing in this game that makes it any different to other turn based games.  Pros  - Excellant graphics. - a lot of work has gone into the game. Definatley an A++ title of you like the single player/turn based/baulder's gate style game. - everything appears to be voice acted - fantastic battle mechanics - fantastic environmental system.  Cons - boring story. Nothing exciting or new to the genre. - the quest system was a little confusing. I was left with many unfinished quests when departing each zone. - I found it quite linear. Although it appears open world, there are 4 set zones (which you cant travel between) and within those zones you are kind of forced to do certain parts one by one as each section's NPC's are a certain level.  - I found the character creation a bit confusing.  - no new unique mechanics appear to be introduced to the turn based genre.

Hellkyte,267,10,4,"September 4, 2017",Not Recommended,11.3,"I really want to give this a positive review.  There's so much good about it, but at the same time I find it borderline unplayable in areas.  The problem I have with it is similar to Divinity 1.  It is too easy to find yourself locked into absurdly overlevelled areas with no way out other than to load a save.  I spent nearly an hour reloading save after save trying to find a hole to thread the needle of my character.  Then there are the issues with the companions.  Do NOT use a premade character, if you do, then you won't be able to recruit that character, and the only characters you can recruit are the premades.  So if you use a premade character you may find yourself unable to fill your party.   There's a lot of other stuff that is interesting, the combat mechanics are...unique for this kind of game, and I like that.  And I also like the elemental stuff working together, although it becomes a bit too much of a cruch later on, so that it's not some unique trick you pull from time to time, but everything exploding everywhere constantly."
TangoXrayNiner,171,2,11,"December 17, 2017",Not Recommended,96.6,"I cant recommend this game.    The combat is horrifyingly bad.  I mean, terrible.  I mean ugly.  The first encounter was with teleporting croc's who cast spells.  They took out my entire party in 4 turns.  I had 3 people in my group at the time.  I said the wrong thing to a guy named Griff in Fort Murder, my entire party killed in 3 turns.  It only got worse and worse and worse.  WHEN I did win a fight, it was like I lost.  I had to use half or more of my finite resources each fight.  Id get to a bigger, harder fight with nothing to help me.  You level slowly, gain little if nothing in loot, then die horrible over and over and over again.    The only redeeming quality is that the game knows your going to lose every fight, and autosaves before.  EDIT: Im editing this because of some of these comments calling me ""Trash"" or ""New/suck at game"" and want to tell me what I already know.  Divinity was an amazing game and I loved it.  The combats were hard, and could go sideways with a quickness.  That was fun to me, same with games like Pillars and Tyranny.    The biggest problem I have with this game is that the combat system is almost entirely predicated on status effects AKA Knockdown, petrify, atrophy, stunned ETC ETC.  BUT, you cant put those status effects on enemies until you completely remove there Physical or Magical armor.  At later levels, if the enemy goes first, your screwed.  Heck I have a lonewolf group that I put alternating points in Strength and Wits, has a 40+ initiative, never goes first.  Now if you can do enough damage, AND can go first, AND have enough action points you can actually DO something to the bad guys.  If not, your left standing there as they decimate you completely and by the time its your turn, several turns have past because they got through your magic and physical armor and applied turn ending status effects.  I have several groups of characters Ive taken to the first big town, past the Dallis boat fight.  None of them seem to have any chance against certain encounters.  And to the person who commented I just brute force my way through, without doing any sidequests.  Well I just watched a couple walkthroughs and realized that I have been doing nothing BUT sidequests.    I still dont know that I can recommend this game.  The story is amazing so far, but the combat and leveling has left something to be desired for me."

My eyes full open from now on trying to get every environmental advantage. Tactician mode = every encounter is like a mini puzzle. and I loved it. 10/10 ----------------------------- Turns out the game becoming progressively boring due to tedious turn times. AI is ♥♥♥♥ed up. Char progression is not satisfying at all you won’t even need to use most of the stats regardless how you want to play. Also, players are deliberately getting tricked investing into wits where it gives the char +1 initiate and +1% crit chance BUT the game’s initiative order is ♥♥♥♥ed up due to design choices ( I guess) so your initiative stats designed to affect your own party's order. The game always makes sure AI enemy is getting a turn after you.  Another thing is really boring is the ♥♥♥♥ing item progression. I changed 3 rare weapons for same char at the same level. Nothing feels really rare except the collar you wear.   The crafting feature is now ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as ever. Because of the console version ( I guess) you get to scroll around 30 different recipes (which all do the same dinner) just to figure out what is what. Same goes for any recipe too. There is no filter menu or good listing feature to see clearly. Lowest tier and highest tier weapons are mixed in the same ‘recipe/ weapons’ section. Thus, looking for something you desire is hard work.  I’m all fine about bugs. None I encountered which breaks the game.  What I’m not OK though is boring combat. I’m 40 hours in and the combats dragging like a lifetime. Yea at first It was all great but now I’m doing the same thing over and over. Nuke the armor, then focus on that opponent. This is repeating over and over. I had that feeling in Pillars after 100hours but in here I got there in 30 hours.

The only improvements over DOS are sensible character development changes that should have been included in the EE.  But, like DOS' EE the focus on this game is the superficial and what sophomoric rpg fans want.  It is definitely a number of steps backwards instead of the leaps forward it should have and could have been with a budget focused on systems and content instead of spinning cameras, console preferences, and full voice overs."

You have to manually pan the camera, and/or use the mouse to move, but the camera doesn't follow behind your character like in typical RPGs, but above and at weird angles, so sometimes you can't see where your character is facing, and you have to manually pan the camera to see what's ahead. Graphics themselves don't seem that bad, but the entire game feels like something you would expect maybe five plus years ago. There also isn't any audio/narration to speak of apart from generic background music, so there's a lot of reading in dialogs, like an old Gameboy era RPG. I like the exploratory options available, but....it was impossible for me to really get into the game, and fighting/combat felt weird, even in Explorer mode. I had tutorial mode turned on, but it still took a lot of googling and trial and error to figure out how it's meant to work.  ---  Edit: Came back to the game after Early Access, and I still hold to my previous points about the weird camera and controls. Still, after struggling with it for a while, I kind of got used to it, though it still isn't as immersive as I'm used to. The game itself is kind of addicting in a mindless kind of way (e.g. investigating stuff, choosing the best armor/equipment and skills, etc for tactical purposes).... but somehow it's not really as immersive story-wise as I would like... Still, it's not as bad as it was before; takes some getting used to, but you get used to it after awhile. Some aspects of the controls (e.g. the tactical view/aspect of it) reminds me of Dragon Age Origins, but it's just not as immersive so it's hard to connect with the story/characters. Even when I set auto-zoom on dialog start, the zoom angle is all strange and cuts off part of the character's head. In general, the camera and movement controls are just strange... but the game does grow on you after a while. The ending is very disappointing though, and there are parts that just don't make sense. It was mildly entertaining while it lasted, but I left feeling unsatisfied. I probably won't be replaying it again anytime soon."

Which was challenging but a lot of fun. The game was a sand box. You coud go anywhere. Great graphics. Voice actors. Every spell was fun to use. Exploring. Stealing was fun.  So i resisted for a while but finally decided to take the plunge and buy the sequel. This game. And lets just say you cant make a masterpiece twice, It would seem. This is quite the opposite. Different races, bigger landscapes, flashier looking bad guys. But this is where all the trouble is.  you get lost in the linear landscapes. No longer can you freely roam the realms. you can only level up by following the extremely restrictive story, which is hard to follow because of the poor graphics. The combats are more about flashy graphics then any kind of balance. One fight in the arena comes to mind. A simple quest to get you from a - b. every time i start the fight. i get auto blinded in the first turn have to chase all the bad guys up and down ladders barely being able to return fire because blind everytime. we had probability in the first game. And chasing enemies up ladders because it looks nice climbing a ladder doesn't make for a fun game and hardly seems anywhere near as tactical as the first game. Just one silly action after another in this game. And im not even on the hard difficulty yet. This games good as a coaster. altho an expensive one. bigger isn't always better."

mayevski,25,4,8,"March 27, 2017",Not Recommended,143.7,"This is the worst purchase I made in recent years. The highest graphics level is full of glitches and overall looks like the game from 90s up-scaled for today monitors. The gameplay is extremely disbalanced - tons of goods and almost no loot, so you can neither get money to buy protection, nor conquer enemies to get higher experience. The explorer mode is not making any difference -- the enemies are a bit weaker, but use the same tactics. The whole idea of ""Stunned"" turns the gameplay into a torture - one unfortunate combination of events, and the whole team is tunned while you are watching the nasty movie of AI playing against dummies. I am happily uninstalling the game and hope to forget it in no longer than a couple of hours. And, well, no... I WANT MY MONEY BACK!"

I'll give steam and the developers the benefit of the doubt and hope this game is just terrible because it is early preview...but short of a miracle I'm pretty sure this is not a game that will be any better than the free alternative. I would offer more specifics on potential areas of improvement but honestly...there are too many to even start.  UPDATE: Refund Granted by Steam. Thank you.  WRT to specific issues...I admit it was a very short time that I played the game. But, I was underwhelmed by graphics (possibly related to my hardware), I found the interface less intuitive than alternatives like PoE or WoW, I found myself wandering around with no clear path, stumbled into an encounter and struggled through (lightning touch was too far 2 steps away, fireball blew up around me, couldn't tell if mobs were alive or dead, couldn't tell if I was on fire or not). wandered around some more with encounters with two NPC which I found tedious and boring, and then encountered a red lizard which I couldn't tell whether he wanted to join me or kill me.) I thought it was the latter when next thing I knew he was in my group despite misleading dialouge.  The we wandred into water and I had a textbox with the word WET appear on me which I found borderline pathetic. Honestly, at that point I wanted to jump off that bridge with the drepressed red lizard. So, I decided to cut my losses and request a refund instead. I'm sorry if my initial impression offends anyone and perhaps I may have come to love the game eventually as it matured and I understood the game better. But, I don't have enough game time to play anything less than great (so perhaps my mistake in testing the waters with an alpha game)."

Sure they made due on there promises allowing friends to come and go as they please, however for those that do decide to join in a friends group at a later date for the long haul are in for a treat. Not only do you get treated as a second rate ""dirty npc"" which has zero impact on the story along with few dialogue choices (even with characters you can pick up from the beginning. This also includes the important pvp arena fights which you get auto kicked out.) but in addition any character dialoges that DO come from your character you can't select, leaving it up to other players to pick what YOU say. This essentally gives a similar feeling to the 4 player mod found in div 1, as unless you love reading a novel or fighting a join in player has minimal impact on the game outside of killing everyone.

It's exactly that, stats get even more inflated and nothing else that matters is different.  My concrete gripes: Attributes are ARPG level simplistic: pump X for damage, maybe Y if you want more HP for some reason, enough memory to get what you want. Stats get massively inflated between levels, items get obsolete every 30 minutes. Armor system is just dumb, both the split damage resists and the 100%/0% CC prevention. The first game's CC spam was also bad, but there are a lot of better solutions than this thing. Make CC duration get reduced by stats/armor/in general, anything really. Initiative doesn't matter, I go / you go between teams(ok, you could get it on 1 party member). It possible that the game is fun if all you only care about a story and bonking a few baddies on the head. I mostly played the first game for the combat and it was really imbalanced, but fun.

gjhall71,407,No,0,"September 29, 2017",Not Recommended,265.7,"Updated:  After getting  to the final  battle I can say game still needs developed and balanced.  You can tell it was rushed  out. The best act is Reapers Coast (2nd act).  3rd just feels rushed and 4th is  just confusing, unpolished and unless you do things in a certain order - some quests just start / end or aren't available.  Combat: you will always be outgunned, out positioned and enemies will hit you even if you are  not  LOS and seem to  have  a lot more action points.  You can  be charmed, mind dominated, taunted  (which is charmed when it is applied on your guys) in which your charater will use any good consumable and have double the action  points that you would have if you were controlling the char.  Crafting:  A joke.  Unless  a  blade  on a stick  is a good weapon.  The only craftable armor  is some eternal armor (just the chest).  Inventory management is - well it's a game in itself all the components that don't do much.   Ask somebody to post a screen shot of the  ""weapons and armor"" recipes available  - you won't see that screen shot on the game page from the developers.  Plot:  wanted to like it - but it ends up being very dark. if you like to be the hero / good guy - pass  - there are no good guys (seriously).  Want to get  needed experience - have to go around butchering people for experience.  In the end all sides are evil. (no joke).  Interface: cludgy. I find myself having to click on a button 2 or 3 times for it to register.  So when i want to choose a knockdown arrow - better make sure the click took.  Final  battle: LMFAO.  even if you tried to  spread your guys out - the conversation that starts with the end ""bosses"" move all of your characters clustered and surrounded by the enemy to get nuked (all magic armor bye bye in first persons attack) - just for 2nd set of bosses to come on simultaneiously. I think by the time my 2nd person had their turn  (all my guys have 40+  initiative) - 2 were dead.   Not fun. 2 of my guys that died didn't even have a turn yet.   Rez? - nope the other 2 were silenced .   Only thing I look for in a game is a challenge through FAIR game play - not having things stacked against the player like dark souls 2.   Any person that plays  this game will be saving and loading more than any other game.  That should  tell the developers something.   I didn't finish the last battle because at this point the game is just frustrating.  If i could apply true tactics in the last fight -  i would wait until all the bosses (about 12 of them -including  all the ones you beat arleady in the game and last game come back, a huge dragon and insane worm that takes up about 20%  of the screen and vomits previous bosses up) fight it out and come back and fight what is left.

Echoic,284,No,0,"November 14, 2016",Not Recommended,143.3,"I can't neatly describe why I find it boring but I'd say it's mainly the early character development and lack of a coherent character motivation in the early game.

With little motivation to explore the map and a highly generic setting populated by one dimensional characters... this is a recipe for zzzzzzzz.  It's a shame since this is a highly sophisticated and even a unique game in many ways.  After an action packed intro the game proper starts on a gorgeous beach.  You can choose to walk around, and if you like, pick up the shells and detritus.  And you think to yourself... why bother?  For me, this is a feeling that never went away playing Div 2 (though I've only made it up to the end of chapter 2).  Within a minute you meet a talking lizard thing guy who in some very awkward dialogue explains that he is a shipwreck survivor, a former Emperor... ugh.. what else... a fugitive from justice, the sole Red skinned example of his race... a proud and noble warrior or maybe a wizard or anything you want him to be.  At this point I was pretty much certain that this was going to be a boring game.  I don't care if he's Jar Jar Binks, no matter how important and interesting you tell me you are you're only serving to highlight that I've got no emotional connection to anything you say or the world or even any investment in my own character.  So I mechanically criss cross the space completing mini quests in any which way you like, because... that's just what you do in a video game.  Some of the quests were good some are just okay all of them are as familiar as you would expect from a genre fiction setting.  Your character levels up, you learn more about the world.  But somehow there's just no tension at all.  The drama ramps up a little later with talk of all caps GODS, THE UNIVERSE and DOOM.  A hackneyed plot foreshadowing some sort of pick option A through D ending once all the combat is done.  The voice acting was fairly good in parts and the (subject matter aside) written narration verges on great.  But it lacks some sort of spark of excitement or creativity.  That is kinda what I'm hoping for when I invest time in a game.  The combat is complex and something of a mixed bag.   Correct positioning for instance is a crapshoot when most characters can teleport and solid ground can become a flaming oil spill and then an electrical storm in the space of a single turn.  Victory can often come down to whether or not you know before hand what abilities your enemy is likely to use.  All in all I'd give the combat part of this game a grudging recommendation but I've been a long time fan of turn based games.  What I really admire about this game is how sort of 'complete' the game rules are.  Everything that happens in game tends to be consistent within its rule set.  It's not as sophisticated as 2007's Oblivon for example but the game engine is certainly the most excellent part of this game and they even had time to inlcludes cool features like multi and DM'ing... though I couldn't really rate them since I didn't try them."

This review is negative due to glitches. The main issue is the common Lady Vengeance lower deck glitch. I, like many people, am blocked from access since the beginning of Act 2. This issue has been present for over a month, and has not been addressed. It locks out some key features, including loot storage, the respec mirror, some merchants, and I've ready later on some quest lines.   To my knowledge, Larian has given no indication of when this will be addressed, only suggesting that people reload to a previous act - putting players in the position of losing progress, or playing onward with a gimped game and no ETA for a fix. I understand that this game has not had long since release, but a month for a such a large glitch is unacceptable to me - and the communication for a fix has been lacking.  Until this isse is fixed, I cannot give Divinity Original Sin 2 a positive review."
mysticalyale,128,No,0,"September 24, 2017",Not Recommended,212.3,"I love Divinity original sin. It allowed for freedom and interesting combinations.  The game had its own charm and the flaws in the system ,overpowered/ underpowered abilitys made it fun to play. The areas and creatures you encountered kinda made sense and you knew generally what to expect.  With that said the enhanced edition was released and the game took a turn for the worse becoming an overbalenced borefest.  This is where Divinity original sin 2 comes in. Just like the enhanced edtion it has great graphics, fun original content,etc etc...  but....its just not like the first. It lacks charm.  I will say straight away I have never  played a game more irritating than this one. The enemies are perfect. They are annoyingly perfect in even action they take. It's just silly. The enviroments are cleary fabricated to put you at the disadvantage. There has clearly been too much time put into making sure that you cannot do anything, but be at the disadvantage. Its maddening.  Things I HATE about this game.     1. Every enemy is everything and every ability is the same. What fun is it when fighting a zombie( in a tactical game) and you get out of range of the zombie( tactically) because, its a zombie and you don't want it close, just to end up getting hit with a ""zombie shot"" while the zombie carefully dodges the obstacles in its path, or you end up having him instantly next to you with a ""zombie teleport"" or even worse he runs over and punches his ally to heal his friend. That is not a zombie, why is every creature so tactical? Why even bother with graphics? Its deceptive and makes no sense. I have seen guys hit themselves to hurt my character, just because they knew it would give me some kind of status effect or kill me. I have seen enemies cast shackles of pain on my charactoer and as the last link to the chain formed they stabbed themselves in the heart. It utter rubbish and it is completely out of character. To add to that , every guy seems to have every ability with just a different name. Its boring, even melee characters can teleport around. At least make them look like they are jumping with their ability, not make it look like magic. I thought the characters on the board were supposed to be each special and different. That is why you have 4 characters right? what is this? Gauntlet? Can't hit them close with your axe so you throw axes? Boring. Rubbish.      2. Overpowered and broken status effects. Taking away people's turns and damaging them is a good way to create one way to do things. Why hit someone with a regular attack when you can take away their turn also. ""Hmm. I don't think I will get battle stomp, where I can hit multple people, destory elemental ground and take away turns, Im going to get something more my character like threaten....(I do have to admit I love watching my characters have threaten cast on them, apparently they are so taunted they do ineffective things to the enemy that taunted them, but also manage to do effective things to harm my team, while also using all of my items for no reason. Hmm.. I going to cast this weak fire spell instead of hitting you for 6k a pop... Rubbish) Dealing with staus effects using armor makes little sense. What is the point of battering ram if you can only use it after you have beaten people down? Isnt it a charge??? I mean they are already standing right next to you at this point! One of the most frusterating things about this game is that almost every fight I witness NPCs making choices simply because they A. They knew everything about my character (and they shoud not). (Glass cannon is a good example. They somehow just know you have glass cannon so they ALL target you for status effects. It is absolutely hair pulling annoying.) Or B. They knew the outcome to every possible choice. Either way this makes them very frusterating to fight. Not fun, frusterating. Games are supposed to be fun    3. Overbalenced. The game is so balenced it is boring.It reminds me of playing everquest and then moving over to play EQ 2.  It forces characters to be ""even"" (through loot, class abilites etc etc..) regardless of the choices you make. Don't believe me? Just look at the loot, its clearly designed for flat stat'ers. When was the last time you saw an armor peice designed for a melee character that had incredible characteristics that required a stacked stat such as strength? My warrior has many a point placed into stats that do nothing for me but make it so I can wear the awesome armor that requires intelligence or finesse.. Scale mail with bonuses to intelligence and various spellcasting bonuses, but requires strength to wear....Please point out a piece of armor and prove me wrong.    4. Every enviroment is everything and every enviroment is not your playpen it is their's. Having trouble with a fight? Run away. Make them come to you. If you can...What should be very clear when playing this game is that confrontations are not setup for you to have any advantage. Alot of time and thought has clearly been put into this. In the first game it seemed more of any ""everybodies playground"". In this game it seems that the enviroments were designed to make it more difficult for players, not as a playpen for everyone. We found it so annoying and difficult that my friend and I just engage fights without even talking to people as a general rule of thumb, because they will attack you anyway, after being jerks, then run away and it works well. (What is up with stat checks? I mean 40+ in a stat and you just lose. pfft.)  5. Throw away guys. I hate fighting enemies who are powerful threats to my survival, but when they are killed they seem to be just empty..... First off.. I want to see their character sheet. How did they, being the same level as me become a wizard who bests me in every stat, hp, armor, strength,  etc etc.. who clearly have items. Where are they? Where are all of their items? They must be pretty dang good to make them as powerful as they are. That is what risk and reward are all about. This game ultimately ends up being all just a risk on my part, with little to no payout. I think if there was one point I could drive home to all games it would be this. There has to be risk on both sides at the very least to confirm the realism of your opponent. You cannot roleplay when everyone is just a shadow of a person.  6. Special campiagn characters. I decided to make my own character and use Lohse and the red prince as my others. I spent time gearing them and leveling them up with the stats I wanted for MY TEAM. Only to have toward the end of the game them both leave the group via result of the story. What?!?! Really?? Why would you do that? I get the idea behind the story, but why would you set players up for failure? There is still team oriented game to be played left. Why would you do that? *Shrug* *laugh* Really?.... Now I get to hire some premade character I cannot adjust at this point of the game to fit the role of the character you took away for the storyline. Dont play the premade characters unless they are your main character.  7. Is there anyone on this game that is remotely likeable? I killed EVERYONE and would do it again and again.. so very unlikeable.  8. 85% is 85% to hit. Why does the game make it seem like its 5%?  Aside from all the ranting, it is fairly fun and well made, but it needs some serious tweaks done to it to give it some charm   Play this one only if you have played the first one to death"

I3LINK,28,No,0,"October 7, 2017",Not Recommended,242.3,"I loved this game when it was released, as well as it's predecessor, and even gave it a raving 10/10 review initially. But after 200+ hours my opinion has somewhat changed, I'll explain. So it's about the combat, which seems to have a lot of depth to it at first, with lots of customisation and potential strategies. But when you take more time to try and get a bit more out of the game and actually put together any form of strategies, you start to realise that combat wise the game doesn't really have so much to offer. For a start let me point out, in case you haven't yet played this installment, how they changed things drastically from DOS1. The armour and shields now indicate whether or not you can inflict status attacks. This completely changes the dynamics of combat, and leaves most battles feeling like a bit of a mess. You see in the first game you could confidently control the flow of combat by knowing who you could inflict status attacks to and plan turns in advanced like a game of chess. Now it feels like inflicting these status attacks comes more down to chance, whether they will be protected or not, and so it becomes difficult to control the flow of combat.  Another problem is that most enemies have some form of teleportation, coupled with their keen prioritisation for attacking your lower health characters. This means that speccing some form of glass canon/mage type of character who sits on the back lines is completely not viable. And I've tried using the Stench talent, but this doesn't lower the chance enough of them attacking your mage unless your mage has near enough the same health as your other characters. What this ultimately means is that all of your characters naturally are required to all have a good amount of armour and shields. The glass canon perk only becomes viable if you can make your character completely untargettable via things like stealth, which is just absurd to create a whole build over. Warriors don't appear to have any real zone of control, so even if the enemy doesn't have teleport they still always manage to walk their way right past your front line. HP/constitution also is completely irrelivent along with certain talents, because any build anticipating to take hits to your HP can easily leave you stun locked by the enemy. This in turn means that necromancer life drain type of builds are pretty much unviable or far too unreliable.  Another problem is the stealth mechanics which are a complete mess and to this day I still don't fully understand how it's supposed to work, or whether they developers even really know themselves. You can chosse to initiate from stealth but then leave your team to fall the the back of the turn qeue putting you at a significant disadvantage, or if you try to leave them in stealth when initiating they unreliably get revealed, it's all just very confusing, and I haven't managed to find a reliable way to benefit from stealth.  Also something I noticed from day one which I was always annoyed about is the lack of diversity in weapon types. I mean a club/mace should deal crushing damage, a sword should cause bleeding, a spear should deal armour piercing, etc... They created all these amazing systems in the game like the bleeding and armour and yet there's no difference between a sword and a mace, there's no incentive to equip one or the other and it just comes down to aesthetic preference. It's a complete oversite and waste of potential and ultimately a let down in what could have otherwise been a great game.  I've really wanted to love this game, the overrall style of the game, the story, characters, the world, it's all really amazing and well done. But the combat is just too much of a mess, and once you realise that there's really not much strategy to be made with the combat then the game starts to feel quite underwhelming. It's funny cause I never really had this problem with the first one, so I think they've ruined what was a perfectly good formula. What they should have done is created a system more similar to XCOM 2, in which case the AI generally prioritises targetting characters which are closest in range, which is due to a higher accuracy. This means you can actually predict who the enemy is going to attack and plan ahead. In XCOM you don't tend to have random enemies who can teleport to your backline, and if so then it's balanced to make it work. In DOS 2 I feel like the developer hasn't balanced these issues correctly and despite how long the game has been released they would have done well to patch these kind of problems by now. Instead they've left the game in a dead state which is unplayable in my opinion. The combat is ultimately very shallow, so apart from some nice story telling I wouldn't expect much depth to the gameplay."
Linio,124,No,0,"March 29, 2017",Not Recommended,134.5,"I could go in depth with why the game shouldn't receive the praise it has received, but some have done it better than me :  http://larian.com/forums/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&Number=647931  Issues that personally gave me a ""bad experience"". - The craft is weaker than the first opus. A lot of the recipes are useless, you don't have the thrill to actually try and craft weapon (you always have better beforehand), some materials are just annoying/impossible to find. - Some of the fights are just infuriating. Two of them particularly with resurrecting creatures are just plain stupid. - The combat system in the end is indeed not really good. I got the attempt to avoid the whole CC shenanigan, but it failed in the sense that it did not deliver an actual better system. The idea behind the armor was not exactly bad but all the things around it to make the system work (provocation without armor, the dumbed down initiative, the inflation of characteristics, etc...) just show that it's half baked. - The game is a bit buggy at times, the quest log is not really working that well - The last act is awful in every regard. Some quests are not really ""working"", you have to go into a whole lot of troubles to have enough XP to face the last combat. - Speaking of the last combat, it's horrible. Either you choose one side and have a combat by far waaaay more complicated than the previous one, to a level where you have to spec your characters perfectly, whereas before, fights were a breathe, or you choose the other side, and it's basically a fight that's over ... veeeeeery quickly with no real challenge - The whole spell/character system is following the armor system and deliver a weird experience. The whole memory stat and possibility to pretty much do everything makes for a weird system overall that I did not like (I must say here, it's a matter of preference). I could go on, but those were the main issues. To me this game does not deserve its praise because it's not as good as the first opus. Still it's not that bad a game (I finished it for crying out loud), but its execution was lackluster in a lot of ways."

dogmanity,57,No,0,April 14,Not Recommended,61.8,"I've changed my recommendation twice now, but at this point I'm done, and I think my opinion is informed and cooked. This is a good game with a bad UI (mouse and keyboard, or controller) that needs some help that mods can't seem to provide, and a structure that is perfectly opaque and relies on savescumming or wikis to push forward an inch at a time.  First the good: Once you understand combat, the game really opens up. Guides on character builds made this work for me. Once I let go of the urge to play without knowing anything, and bookmarked the wikis, I began to really enjoy myself. I got several hours in and I intended to keep playing. The atmosphere is solid. The voice acting is genuinely good. Big surprise! They spent real energy on building the world.  Then the standard: Game mechanics are fairly convoluted. Unwinnable fights await you in random areas that are apparently ""next"", so save scumming is a must. Without internet guidance, you might foolishly believe that a bad weapon is good. Some of this convolution gives way to depth as you learn and read online guides, but some remains. The leveling system is pretty cool, and the character build variety can make for a very interesting party. Although it seems unanimously true that a Lone Wolf is the best way to guarantee your victory, I think you would lose out a lot on the game, since the character interactions are pretty cool.  Finally, the interest-killingly bad: It takes more clicks than you can imagine just to sell all the junk in your inventory to a blacksmith. A blacksmith who wanders around her shop endlessly, and in trying to talk to her, you'll inadvertently steal her pliers, because they're the same button, which will cause her to dislike you permanently. I hope you saved before trying to talk to the blacksmith! Traveling around even on the first island takes a long time, and there is no real guidance. Once I scummed my way through the first boss and got to the second area, I realized this was going to be a pattern. I was tired of it immediately. Then I got into about 20 no-warning fights, where I effectively watched a cinematic of enemies popping into existence from somewhere, getting first initiative, and murdering my entire party in a single turn, and I completely lost interest. I don't think it should be my job to magically know where I can safely go next.  I hope development continues for this game. There's a lot of potential. Although this is the kind of game where spending your money on it makes the gaming ecosystem stronger, and it has a lot of truly unique strengths, I still can't recommend it."

I know this is more common these days, but it's still not cool. * The quests are seemingly deliberately confusing and opaque, like riddles.  * For a game supposedly built around pen and paper freedom, you seem to need to do all side quests to have enough XP/levels to go forward in the main story. * Buggy, had to reload after doing Examine on my incarnate and he couldn't do any actions after that"

Most of the stuff, like the annoying pop up when the game starts, I shook off, even though it made using the steamlink a royal pain.    Finally about 16 hours in, I hit a bug where the Fane character is completely locked up.  I can actually teleport him around the map and he takes no damage and repondes to nothing.  Since he wasn't in the party, I had no way to know this had happened.  I went back though my saves and apperantly he bugged upon resetting to his normal waiting spot when I removed him from the party,  It meant backing up 4 hours.  I walked away.  Maybe some other time I will pick this back up and just start over without ever using Fane,  It's a wonderful game, but with gamebreaking bugs.

The story is great I'm sure, good characters, good graphics, etc.  But the line of sight/line of fire system is extremely critical to the tactical combat, and it's extremely broken. You will not spend five hours playing before you will find yourself in a situation where you do not have line of sight or line of fire when you absolutely should, or when the enemy is able to attack you when they absolutely shoud not have line of sight/line of fire.  When this basic aspect of a tactical combat game is so totally arbitrary and senseless, it makes combat feel totally stupid, unbelievable, and unfair. Even if you win, it just feels stupid."

Draba,41,No,0,"November 4, 2017",Not Recommended,4.1,"Basic combat mechanics are a big letdown for me, the tactician mode in the original kickstarter reward came with a promise that it won't simply be a numbers change. It's exactly that, stats get even more inflated and nothing else that matters is different.  My concrete gripes: Attributes are ARPG level simplistic: pump X for damage, maybe Y if you want more HP for some reason, enough memory to get what you want. Stats get massively inflated between levels, items get obsolete every 30 minutes. Armor system is just dumb, both the split damage resists and the 100%/0% CC prevention. The first game's CC spam was also bad, but there are a lot of better solutions than this thing. Make CC duration get reduced by stats/armor/in general, anything really. Initiative doesn't matter, I go / you go between teams(ok, you could get it on 1 party member). It possible that the game is fun if all you only care about a story and bonking a few baddies on the head. I mostly played the first game for the combat and it was really imbalanced, but fun.

gjhall71,407,No,0,"September 29, 2017",Not Recommended,265.7,"Updated:  After getting  to the final  battle I can say game still needs developed and balanced.  You can tell it was rushed  out. The best act is Reapers Coast (2nd act).  3rd just feels rushed and 4th is  just confusing, unpolished and unless you do things in a certain order - some quests just start / end or aren't available.  Combat: you will always be outgunned, out positioned and enemies will hit you even if you are  not  LOS and seem to  have  a lot more action points.  You can  be charmed, mind dominated, taunted  (which is charmed when it is applied on your guys) in which your charater will use any good consumable and have double the action  points that you would have if you were controlling the char.  Crafting:  A joke.  Unless  a  blade  on a stick  is a good weapon.  The only craftable armor  is some eternal armor (just the chest).  Inventory management is - well it's a game in itself all the components that don't do much.   Ask somebody to post a screen shot of the  ""weapons and armor"" recipes available  - you won't see that screen shot on the game page from the developers.  Plot:  wanted to like it - but it ends up being very dark. if you like to be the hero / good guy - pass  - there are no good guys (seriously).  Want to get  needed experience - have to go around butchering people for experience.  In the end all sides are evil. (no joke).  Interface: cludgy. I find myself having to click on a button 2 or 3 times for it to register.  So when i want to choose a knockdown arrow - better make sure the click took.  Final  battle: LMFAO.  even if you tried to  spread your guys out - the conversation that starts with the end ""bosses"" move all of your characters clustered and surrounded by the enemy to get nuked (all magic armor bye bye in first persons attack) - just for 2nd set of bosses to come on simultaneiously. I think by the time my 2nd person had their turn  (all my guys have 40+  initiative) - 2 were dead.   Not fun. 2 of my guys that died didn't even have a turn yet.   Rez? - nope the other 2 were silenced .   Only thing I look for in a game is a challenge through FAIR game play - not having things stacked against the player like dark souls 2.   Any person that plays  this game will be saving and loading more than any other game.  That should  tell the developers something.   I didn't finish the last battle because at this point the game is just frustrating.  If i could apply true tactics in the last fight -  i would wait until all the bosses (about 12 of them -including  all the ones you beat arleady in the game and last game come back, a huge dragon and insane worm that takes up about 20%  of the screen and vomits previous bosses up) fight it out and come back and fight what is left.

So I mechanically criss cross the space completing mini quests in any which way you like, because... that's just what you do in a video game.  Some of the quests were good some are just okay all of them are as familiar as you would expect from a genre fiction setting.  Your character levels up, you learn more about the world.  But somehow there's just no tension at all.  The drama ramps up a little later with talk of all caps GODS, THE UNIVERSE and DOOM.  A hackneyed plot foreshadowing some sort of pick option A through D ending once all the combat is done.  The voice acting was fairly good in parts and the (subject matter aside) written narration verges on great.  But it lacks some sort of spark of excitement or creativity.  That is kinda what I'm hoping for when I invest time in a game.  The combat is complex and something of a mixed bag.   Correct positioning for instance is a crapshoot when most characters can teleport and solid ground can become a flaming oil spill and then an electrical storm in the space of a single turn.  Victory can often come down to whether or not you know before hand what abilities your enemy is likely to use.  All in all I'd give the combat part of this game a grudging recommendation but I've been a long time fan of turn based games.  What I really admire about this game is how sort of 'complete' the game rules are.  Everything that happens in game tends to be consistent within its rule set.  It's not as sophisticated as 2007's Oblivon for example but the game engine is certainly the most excellent part of this game and they even had time to inlcludes cool features like multi and DM'ing... though I couldn't really rate them since I didn't try them."

Infinite respec is a really REALLY mega stupid dumb dumb idea. There basically is no classes or builds in this game cause you can at any time open a respec page, and redistribute all your  stats and abilities, LITERALLY. Also the strongest build is +5 pyro/lightning/water/earth just enough for the ultimates, and then +15 into scoundrel for crit multiplier. with apothesis you cast every ulty in the game making every fight extremely easy on the hardest difficulty.  So no I can't recommend this game. If they had made multiplayer less completely stupid. and the respec system is just extremely lazy.

It's not like he's some civilian or 'scared' person... it's a damn 'Fighting Character' that should have the judgement to not RUN INTO FIRE when low on health, with 1 mob left to finish a fight.

Aaron Shaver,57,No,0,January 26,Not Recommended,21.7,"I didn't like this game.  * The armor system is simplistic and boring. If an enemy has even 1 armor point, they block all effects until the armor is gone. * Combat in general becomes boring after a few fights. There's a few heuristics you learn in terms of using the environment, healing, etc., and once memorized, there's not much variety. * Lots of looking things up in wikis / forums. I know this is more common these days, but it's still not cool. * The quests are seemingly deliberately confusing and opaque, like riddles.  * For a game supposedly built around pen and paper freedom, you seem to need to do all side quests to have enough XP/levels to go forward in the main story. * Buggy, had to reload after doing Examine on my incarnate and he couldn't do any actions after that"
I3LINK,28,No,0,"October 7, 2017",Not Recommended,242.3,"I loved this game when it was released, as well as it's predecessor, and even gave it a raving 10/10 review initially. But after 200+ hours my opinion has somewhat changed, I'll explain. So it's about the combat, which seems to have a lot of depth to it at first, with lots of customisation and potential strategies. But when you take more time to try and get a bit more out of the game and actually put together any form of strategies, you start to realise that combat wise the game doesn't really have so much to offer. For a start let me point out, in case you haven't yet played this installment, how they changed things drastically from DOS1. The armour and shields now indicate whether or not you can inflict status attacks. This completely changes the dynamics of combat, and leaves most battles feeling like a bit of a mess. You see in the first game you could confidently control the flow of combat by knowing who you could inflict status attacks to and plan turns in advanced like a game of chess. Now it feels like inflicting these status attacks comes more down to chance, whether they will be protected or not, and so it becomes difficult to control the flow of combat.  Another problem is that most enemies have some form of teleportation, coupled with their keen prioritisation for attacking your lower health characters. This means that speccing some form of glass canon/mage type of character who sits on the back lines is completely not viable. And I've tried using the Stench talent, but this doesn't lower the chance enough of them attacking your mage unless your mage has near enough the same health as your other characters. What this ultimately means is that all of your characters naturally are required to all have a good amount of armour and shields. The glass canon perk only becomes viable if you can make your character completely untargettable via things like stealth, which is just absurd to create a whole build over. Warriors don't appear to have any real zone of control, so even if the enemy doesn't have teleport they still always manage to walk their way right past your front line. HP/constitution also is completely irrelivent along with certain talents, because any build anticipating to take hits to your HP can easily leave you stun locked by the enemy. This in turn means that necromancer life drain type of builds are pretty much unviable or far too unreliable.  Another problem is the stealth mechanics which are a complete mess and to this day I still don't fully understand how it's supposed to work, or whether they developers even really know themselves. You can chosse to initiate from stealth but then leave your team to fall the the back of the turn qeue putting you at a significant disadvantage, or if you try to leave them in stealth when initiating they unreliably get revealed, it's all just very confusing, and I haven't managed to find a reliable way to benefit from stealth.  Also something I noticed from day one which I was always annoyed about is the lack of diversity in weapon types. I mean a club/mace should deal crushing damage, a sword should cause bleeding, a spear should deal armour piercing, etc... They created all these amazing systems in the game like the bleeding and armour and yet there's no difference between a sword and a mace, there's no incentive to equip one or the other and it just comes down to aesthetic preference. It's a complete oversite and waste of potential and ultimately a let down in what could have otherwise been a great game.  I've really wanted to love this game, the overrall style of the game, the story, characters, the world, it's all really amazing and well done. But the combat is just too much of a mess, and once you realise that there's really not much strategy to be made with the combat then the game starts to feel quite underwhelming. It's funny cause I never really had this problem with the first one, so I think they've ruined what was a perfectly good formula. What they should have done is created a system more similar to XCOM 2, in which case the AI generally prioritises targetting characters which are closest in range, which is due to a higher accuracy. This means you can actually predict who the enemy is going to attack and plan ahead. In XCOM you don't tend to have random enemies who can teleport to your backline, and if so then it's balanced to make it work. In DOS 2 I feel like the developer hasn't balanced these issues correctly and despite how long the game has been released they would have done well to patch these kind of problems by now. Instead they've left the game in a dead state which is unplayable in my opinion. The combat is ultimately very shallow, so apart from some nice story telling I wouldn't expect much depth to the gameplay."
seekr,188,No,0,"September 21, 2017",Not Recommended,170.7,"E: After +150h I have different opinions about this one.  I'm comparing this to the previous instalment because why not?  - The armor system really SUCKS compared to the last divinity game, you are forced to use full mage or full phys damage squad to properly use CC - Croud control (without mods) because the armors are separated to physical armor and magic armor. Therefore even special arrows are pretty much worthless and it is not worth taking the perks regarding them.  - Less action points = less fun. Admittedly in D:OS EE you could have OP archers but raising difficulty solved that. Again you can raise AP with mods but after that it's not balanced.  - Source skills are annoying to use imo BECAUSE of less AP and they are even not that good when they take all your action points and ultimately do less damage than a basic polymorph skill  - Some broken/annoying mechanics; aiming at an enemy and still missing and hitting the ground below during combat is really annoying when you already have so little AP overall.  - Some talents and abilities are worthless and broken ex. stench (less agro againgst melee enemies) doesn't work half the time, lone wolf talent is overpowered. Reactive shot skill barely works half the time also.  - Story is meh  - Area effects (poison clouds, steam clouds, frozen water/ground/blood (not including cursed ground) etc. last very little time so they don't have the time to do any damage or CC to enemies because they also have magic armor.  ---- Less explosions from elemental combos :(((  + More interesting classes ex. summoning & polymorph  + Freedom of choice + You can pretty much kill everyone and everything if you would like to.   ++Still solid fun when playing with a friend/friends + with mods.

Dr. Vodka,54,No,0,July 19,Not Recommended,200.7,"I do not like it for a number of reasons despite having invested 200-ish hours into it.  To start off I generally don't like companion-oriented gameplay where you're given a few characters and expected to be overly attached to them. I seriously find them impossible to care about, why should I be interested in these people? A lot of characters feel contrived and unbelievable as-well, especially the dwarves and their Scottishness for some reason (I've been to Scotland and it feels extremely unnatural for everybody to have shrunken by two to three feet since my last visit).  There's too much exposition given to things and people and dialogue that I have to wade through, which is equally as brain-numbingly horrible. It wouldn't be so bad if I found the lore captivating in the slightest, but the game is littered with fantasy cliches. As-in not the occasional elf/dwarf/orc/whatever sprinkled about, it's built on everybody being a human or elf or dwarf or lizard and the protagonist being a chosen one and the world being threatened at the hands of darkness monsters.  Conversation is mildly fun but if you've not got persuasion you're basically doomed, and you can only really specialise in one thing (including persuasion) unless you want to be totally incompetent. It also becomes boring rather fast, despite the unique tags and whatevers.  Similarly, the idea of the Divine Order being horrible and depraved below the surface is unique, but it's rubbed in so utterly thick my brain just sighs and goes ""Yes, I know they're turning people into mindless husks, yes they're horrible and callous, yessir, yes anything you say"" whenever the fact decides to violently club itself back into obviousness as you see Divine Order Depravity No. 8000.  It's as though the game itself is conscious of its sheer mundanity. I hit the ancient civilisation bit and the architecture is literally geometrical, as though to say ""♥♥♥♥, I can't be bothered to make any more countryside/forest/castle/tavern/dungeon anymore, why don't I just throw in a few granite shapes in a vaguely mystical looking fashion?"". The landscapes in-game are like what you'd get if you sampled British countryside in the middle of nowhere and injected a lot of rocks and wood and boats and Medieval-ish things.  You have to trudge through the borescape via teleportation and agonisingly light-paced jogging. Peering down on your little avatar. It's about as riveting as it sounds.  Then, there's combat! I advise you never attempt Lone Wolf (I.E. soloing) unless you truly want to multiply the tedium and horrific feeling of time-wasting emptiness tenfold. That is seriously not fun.  While I admire the tactical aspect of combat quite a lot, you will inevitably end up using your same strategy every time on a given character (to name a few of mine I have 'Dipping People in Oil and then Setting Them on Fire', 'Staying Invisible and then Teleporting Behind Somebody before Violently Gutting Them into a Bleeding Chicken with Ruptured Tendons before Turning Invisible Again' and 'Angrily Battering Somebody until you can Knock Them Over a Lot and Possibly Turn Them into a Chicken As-Well'). It becomes quite repetitive and dulls the planning aspect a fair bit, although I admit it can be rather fun, just not when it's tedious and long-winded.  There are hints of clicheness however, as I've found (personally) that a lot of abilities are rather common elemental things (fire/water, lightning, what have you) and you have generic ranger/assassin/warlord archetypes. I don't mind this however because it makes up for it with the more unique trees like Scoundrel, Necromancer and Polymorph (edgy choices I know, but I am somewhat fond of them), though I wish games would come up with more original ideas for magical abilities.  Overall, Divinity just feels like a very dull, empty and artificial experience that I am remorseful to have spent so much time on. Regardless though, I have enjoyed playing it with my brother. My main complaint is that it is too generic thematically, progress is too long and artifically stretched out, there are a lot of recycled assets and overall that it just doesn't have any spark or appeal that makes it feel special and like a lovely experience.  I have no clue why the game is held in such high regard, perhaps nowadays if a game is deemed functional and able to ram as many mechanical and thematic cliches into one bundle it makes for a revolutionary experience.  Either way, I think I would find performing violent dentistry on myself with an oversized cleaver for several hours more unique, imaginitive, fun and enlightening than every single hour that I've spent on Divinity."

Lost Sinner,79,518,12,"August 15, 2017",Recommended,"2,780.1","♦ One of the best cRPG out there, if you are a fan of roleplaying games, this is definitely a must buy. For those who never play thier first game, no worries, although they take places in a same universe, each has a standalone story. This one starts thousand years after the first one so you are not missing anything.  ♦ One of best thing about DOS 2 is it gameplay. It's turn-based, slow-paced but really interactive with many different elemental combinations, cool interactions between each abilities and your surrounding environmental even statuses are interesting.   For some examples you can create some nasty chain explosive reactions with a combo of Fire and Poison, any kind of liquid (water/blood/poison/...) left on the battleground can reacted to Air turning it into a pool of Electricity deal damage and stun anyone in it.    Buffs/debuffs status usually do more than one thing and may interact with eachother, Stone Armor not only increase your physical armor but also stop you from bleeding/burning because you are solid rock. Peace Of Mind is the kind of ability that let you see a bigger pictures, it provides stats buff and cure Blindness BUT also remove frenzy status Rage, because the target have become more wise so no more bold actions. Rage on the otherhand is also another status which increase damage output but at a great cost of defense down.   Surrounding environmental also plays a great part in your game, say if someone go invisible and there is happen to be raining, that sneaky guy will be revealed because he's wet. And because water react violently with electricity, he will be taking increased Air damage but will take less damage if you throw a fireball at him. Walking through frozen ground and you may trip and get knocked down. Standing on high ground will make your spells/abilities/items reach further with increased damage. ♦ Talents in game open up your playstyles depend on what you pick. Lone Wolf or One Man Army does what it says for who want to go solo, Leech turn you into a vampire allowing you to heal when standing near blood or Zombie make Poison heal you instead but normal healing will damage you. Because the game is classless , you can be anyone , mix and match anything you like, you may be born a warrior but dream to be a mage, go learn some magic and become a battlemage. Who says warrior can't be sneaky, go ahead and get yourself some rogue abilities...  ♦ Divinity Original Sin 2 also offer you really great roleplaying experience, it has a great balance between combat and talking with rich dialogues and occasional silly humors. You can play as different races: Human , Elf , Dwarf , Undead and Lizard..yeah thats' right, you can become a Lizard that spits out Fire. Each races have different racial skill and special power, NPCs may also react/talk differently to you depend on your race. There are also different original characters ingame who have thier own story, goals and personalites for you to play, but if you want to create your own character, the game also offer many different origins which called tags: Soldier, Scholar, Outlaw,..etc which plays a part in dialogue. The Origins will remain in your game as companion and you can have different perspective on them through dialogues/questline which is really cool imo,  there is also a relationship system ingame (not fully included in EA , will be in full game) which can create intense rivalry, friendship, enmity and romance!  ♦ Visually, the game looks great, it's colorful most of the times and can be dark when needed to be, infact the DOS 2 is meant to be darker and much more focused than the previous one. Having finished Act 1 in EA, there are no fetch quests and unrelated to the storyline, all of them is connected one way or another, each tell you a story about the game's world and ultimately leading to a bigger picture. You can finish quests in different ways , any path is a progression, you'll never feel getting stuck, there are always different paths to take, things to do. Oh a maze, i'm not in the mood to solve puzzle atm, let's jump/fly through it, dont have wings? Look around, there's maybe some other hidden paths/shortcut or go do some questline maybe some of them will shed some lights of the Maze making it easier to go through.  ♦ Crafting is in game (duh..! obviously, it's an cprg game) and it's RICH. Just look up the crafting list in DOS 1, and  before there were just a combination of two items, in DOS 2 you can have a combination of total 5 items. Here comes the great part, you can craft new skills by combining books of different schools. You can turn a normal rain into a mean blood storm. Mixing a Pryo spell with Necromancy, you can make corpses explode dealing massive damage to nearby targets as if you cutting thier buddies down wasn't enough..  ♦ There are alot more cool features ingame but i won't include them all in this small review. So i'll add one more thing that may get some people excited: There will be a Game Master Mode! which have up to 5 players in total which include 4 main players and 1 GM. Allowing you to create your own worlds and adventure with friends, the devs also offer alot of tools for easier time making your own dungeon, you can control anything, the stats, the weather, music, dialouges, events,..etc and you can even do it on the fly! You can take a quick look of the mode here (a GM Mode game hosted by Matt Mercer)  ♦ If you are interested in some gameplays, feel free to check my videos: Honour Mode Walkthrough "

Negatives- It's been a fair bit since I played, but I had an issue finishing a companion quest that was tied into the same NPC as another companion I had. Once completed, one companion was stuck and could not progress. I ended up finishing the game without completing it. - A few bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking. Most notably in ""The Arx"". There was one house with locked doors in which you could run right through them. - I noticed here and there a fair bit of an FPS drop in combat when my screen is exploding with spell effects.

Bugs: - Sometimes your helmet will blink and flicker a bit - Sometimes your characters won't be within range, or have line of sight on a target they clearly should - Accuracy percentage seems to be a bit off, 80% chance to hit is more like 30%; anything under 90% is trouble That's...

Let me start by stating that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is my all time favorite game. I adored the first one. I'm worshippping the second.  This isn't a game that'll hold your hand, this isn't a game that's easy and laid back. This is the game that throws you in the middle of a world and tells you to figure it out.   It has multiple difficulty settings, so if tactical turnbased combat isn't your strongest suit there ARE easier modes for you! But the harsh combat isn't the only thing that makes this game hard. It's the quests, the world, there is NO handholding. You got to figure out what to do, you got to figure out which quest to solve and focus on. And boy are there many quests to focus on!  Some seem absolutely random, some seem like just a typical sidequest kind of job that ends up being the key ingredient in solving the big mystery! I love that, I love that the first act has you stuck on an island, a jail, and your job is to break out. And how would one do this? There isn't just one way, or two, or three. There are more than that. Way more. And it's up to you to figure out the way.   There are five races, human, dwarf, elf, lizard, and undead. Each brings with their own talents and experience in the game. You might have trouble with certain quests because they hate your race, you might need to find another way into a town because they don't like dwarves. It's extremely immersive, and playing it as a coop makes it even so.   I'm not sure I have words to describe to you how amazing this game is. I like difficult games, I played this on Tactical, which is hard, and on some boss fights me and my coop partner would sit here for two hours. Reloading. Repositioning. Changing skills. Reloading. over and over untill we finally managed to beat said boss. It was one of the most amazing experiences I've had in gaming all year. Just that little bit of having to figure out how something works.  There are Character Tags and Talents that you can choose that really makes this into an immersive rpg. Pet Pal allows you to talk to animals. That sad dog over there, cheer him up and he'll help you. That nasty fire elemental? Guess what! She needs your help! You can have a talent that makes you stink, and people dislike you because of it.   Larian Studios is a dev team to follow. I cannot wait to see what comes next.

There was partial voice acting, but somehow they managed to make the entire game voice acted, without starting another kickstarter and without pushing the game back a few months.

Said DM really fell in love with the cosmology and deities section of the Dungeon Master's Guide as well as the idea of creating an epic, REALLY LONG arc where his players eventually achieve godhood. Mr. DM also put an awful lot of time into fleshing out his world and making sure you know that HIS elves are DIFFERENT (they EAT people and get their MEMORIES, see), though for some reason he decided to keep his dwarves Scottish.  This DM is not perfect and has his faults. For one, he really loves throwing environmental effects all over the battlefield to the point of it becoming annoying. Fire spreads 50 feet in an arc! Now ice shoots out over the fire! Now smoke and lighting and tentacles spread atop the fire and ice! Yeah! Near the end of the campaign, his planning starts to slip, both in combat design and in lore. For instance, he offers his players a variety of different endings to their grand adventure, but none of them are all that great, and one gets the feeling that he randomly chose the final boss by just flipping through the Monster Manual with the intent of picking a Challenge Rating 30 beastie just to tell his other DM friends that ""I PUT MY PLAYERS UP AGAINST THIS GUY ONCE AND THEY KIND OF SURVIVED!""   After playing for nearly 140 hours, though, none of his players can say it wasn't an epic time at the table. They'll probably be back for more.  BTW, Mr. DM - Lohse was the best character you created."

More content, more polished and more fun than any triple A game developer will give you, at 2/3 the price and no hundreds of holes to add paid content later. Even in the Early Access phase this is already more polished than most games are 3 months after official launch.  The game itself: It's the original + improved and better in every single way. Graphics look great and the engine is very well optimized (already). The combat and progression system is very well done and fun. Multiplayer even better integrated than the original. Storyline and characters are interesting and well written. The music, I absolutely love it. Affordable.  Even if you fear the Early Access tag, just buy this if you're into this type of games at all, you won't be disappointed and you'll actually be supporting a developer that delivers and makes games for the gamers, not for mass revenue. (Of course they're a business in it for profit too, but there's a difference between 45 euro for a full game and 60 euro for a game with 10 strategically placed holes for paid DLC, pushed into release with game breaking bugs. Larian Studios actually ditched their publisher and switched to crowd funding because they forced them to make and launch the game the way they didn't want it, that should tell you enough.)  Larian Studios, as a Belgian, I can say you make us proud. Please keep doing what you're doing, never succumb to the attitude most major developers and publishers have, it'd be a huge loss in the game industry."

You can play the game multiple times and you would have a different experience each time you play it.   Try to get some friends to play with you, they can either help you or turn against you.

Did you notice the Divine Edition is only $15 but not at all game-changing or content locking from the base game? Did you notice the Game Master Mode wasn't a purchasable DLC? That is humility right there. They aren't trying to squeeze every last person for some money. They are looking to create quality content so that we can enjoy it at, for what you're buying, an extremely generous price. They knew the fan-base and what people wanted and how bad they wanted it.

I was tired of games that say it's 60 dollars, only to have randomized loot boxes or micro-transaction implemented later in time. I was tired of games that were advertised to be wide as an ocean but ended up being shallow like a puddle.   Then Divinity Original Sin 2 came out. Each encounter is well executed and designed flawlessly. Enemy design  is varied and leaves my friend and I saying ""WTF is that!?"" often. Every time my friend finds some epic loot, we cannot wait to identify it to see who can make use of the item. Quests are a joy to do and often leads you to find more quests that's filled with important decision making. Every choice you make has an impact on the world and I have been sent to jail multiple times for making the wrong decision. For $44.99 you are not buying a game but an experience. An experience to truly go on an epic adventure. Fights are never easy but once you learn the satisfaction of besting the enemy combatant that you failed to take down multiple times, you are left leaving for more glory.

I don't go a single moment in this game without being mesmerized by how fantastic it is.  I'll list some pros:  -Beautiful art style, everything looks amazing.  -Combat that is both simple and incredibly difficult at the same time. After two-to-three encounters the player will have a good grasp of how combat works, but throughout the entire game they'll be learning new ways to manipulate the environment and their abilities to play better.  -Fantastic writing, honestly amazing.  -Perfect soundtrack, every sound and song in this game is so perfectly adjusted for the situation it's seamless and very immersive.  -Highly addictive, once I sit down to play I'm practically rooted to my chair to continue.  -Companions you'll care about, it's the tragedy of lesser RPGs that your companions are boring and lifeless, but here, everyone has their own ambitions and goals, and WILL pursue them.    There's very little wrong about this game. Previously I mentioned that voice acting won't be included which would be a con to some, but in a complete surprise Larian have voiced the entire game, despite the fact that was never planned throughout development.

Made by Larian Studios, it was able to level with AAA games that it even surpasses the standards, regardless of its flaws.  You'll play as your own character in the story, and embark on a journey towards the world of Rivellon as you find the answer to the cause of the Void's awakening. You could also play as one of the six main characters with their own unique story if character creation is not your thing.  Also, quicksaving before doing anything else is a must. Talk to someone, quicksave first. Interacting an item, quicksave first. Opening a door, quicksave. After an autosave, quicksave.  REVIEW The game is very similar to its previous title, Divinity: Original Sin (DOS1). There may be changes, but there's nothing too drastic as far as I've observed.   STORYDOS2 moved towards a more interesting Plot. While it still does have DOS1's lighthearted ""HaHa""s, the studio was able to put the humor at the right spot. In a way, they're able to make a decently captivating tale for an RPG. What's so interesting about the plot's flow is that the game doesn't make you feel like you need to save the world because when you want to go somewhere, doing so will progress your main story. The linearity is barely present that I didn't even know which quest I should keep my focus on my first playthrough.   It's quite unfortunate, for me at least, how the game treats the Party Interaction on the whole story as it progresses because it had less... interaction. Back in DOS1's party interaction, you're able to choose a dialogue for everyone. DOS2 removed that feature and only allows you to choose a dialogue for your main character only; however, in turn they added an Attitude system, so your party members and everyone else in the game have their own morals and beliefs. In the end, it sadly lowers the replayability. GAMEPLAYOn the matter of the game's Quest System, I become lost throughout my first playthrough. Given that most of your progress relates to the main story, a quest that I've ignored for an in-game day (since I'm focusing on a particular quest at that time) suddenly updates along with the quest I'm currently taking. There are some cases during an update to my current quest, a new quest opens up in my journal. In a long run, the quest log became flooded to a point that I don't know which quest would I continue.  The turn-based Combat System is really great. Given how there's hundreds of skills and hardly countable ways of killing an enemy, the fact that good positioning actually gives an advantage, it's hard to get bored of it. Unlike many turn-based games, the Original Sin series shines on how your surroundings affect you and your enemy's strategy. The lit torch stand, the oil puddle poured near an explosive barrel, the sea shore, everything is interactive. In DOS2, the height advantage was a great addition.  The game's Challenge is the one that sparks its replayability. It's not just how unfair some items/skills are, it's the moment when the AI actually knows how, where, and when to use the environment and situation to their advantage. Once you've come up with a different build, their playstyle changes. They are annoyingly smart that sometimes they're three turns ahead of you if you're not aware enough.  Carelessly set a trap mine near an enemy, one of them will then teleport you on top of it. Enemies even face behind a wall just so your Rogue character can't backstab him/her. Although, there is a time when a hazardous area is too wide, the AI keeps on walking around the said area until they die instead of just standing still. It has its awful moments sadly. AESTHETICSComparing the two of the series, DOS2 was able to utilize more graphical features which made it far more detailed than DOS1. It shifted from a cartoony colorful vibe into a more realistic and bleak environment. Even so, the Graphics were decent at best.   The Music score is an improvement from the previous title. Just comparing the two themes, you could say that they have more budget this time haha. It's interesting how you could select your character's instrument theme, so you could hear a particular instrument on certain occasions depending on what you chose for one of your characters. As much as how catchiness goes however, it's not as grand as what I always hear from Bioware and Bethesda games. For short, DOS2's music is ingenuinely good.  Sample OST I personally liked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxuC0i5S_LE For a game that lacks flashy CGI cinematics, they were able to compensate it with the expressive Voice Dialogues. You've gotta hand it to the voice actors and scriptwriters for making their characters and npcs feel alive. It's interesting how most of them have something to say inside and outside of the conversation. FEATURESFor a turn-based game, the Playability is good. Besides the 4 player multiplayer, there's couch co-op and controller support. The game is playable in any way but 3-4 splitscreen multiplayer, yet it's still rare to find such accessibility this time around in video games.  Game Master Mode is a cool feature that you can't believe it's included on the standard game. Though, I'm not fond of Dungeons and Dragons, it really seems that's what it's trying to make out of this game mode. In my case, this is a casual DnD that includes the game's character abilities and such. An interesting mode to say the least.  Arena Mode is a decent feature if you're up for some PvP duels. Besides the fact that you could play online, there's an offline mode called Hot Seat where you and your fellow players play in one device.  Lastly, this game has the Classic Edition (CE) which removes tons of new dialogues and enemy encounters along with the updated User Interface for controller users from the Definitive Edition.

Blaze,112,161,25,"December 6, 2017",Recommended,63.1,"Spent two months debating whether I should spend this much money on a game.   I would spend twice the money to experience this game again for the first time. Haven't even touched Multiplayer/DnD mode yet.  As a longtime fan of RPGs, this is not just the greatest RPG I've ever played, it is in the running for the best single player experience I have ever had on PC.  Everything you do seems to have a meaningful impact on everything you will do next. After 30 hours of gameplay I had to stop reloading quick saves and accept my decisions... Divinity 2 rarely presents you with black and white moral choices, and a simple slip of the tongue will see you losing loved ones fast.  The combat is challenging, in a good way. It allows you to customize your party completely and make logical and creative decisions in combat that you don't really expect to work but then they totally have an effect you weren't expecting....  ...that is why this game is perfection. Every time I pushed at the borders of the game to see if I could get away with something, I realised the border wasn't there... so I pushed harder and got more creative...  I have a man who can speak to Animals and I highly suggest you take the Perk that allows this ASAP in game because it opens up a huge depth to storyline. I now treat Chickens and Squirrels with the same respect as I do any other NPC. I speak to the ghosts of the dead and they present me with A LOT of moral decisions.   How far will you spin your moral compass to become Godly powerful? Who will you grow close to only to realise that at any moment they might stab you in the back or even worse... that you will have to choose to lose for the sake of the greater good?  14/10 would sneak a peek at Lizard Royalty having sex in a caravan again x"
Bee,130,104,9,June 24,Recommended,436.2,"After hitting over 400 hours in Divinity: Original Sin 2, I feel like I can finally review it in full depth.  The game is spectacular. It was everything I wanted from Original Sin and then more.   The quests are in-depth, and you feel the consequences of your character/race choices on top of the dialogue you pick. I've played four full playthroughs, and each one I was still finding things I had missed (and I'm sure I will find more in my next one). The story is just fantastic, I couldn't ask for more from a storyline. The game makes you want to read every little lore book and just learn more and more about anything and everything going on. And if you're an Original Sin fan, there's little pieces of lore left around everywhere for you to prick your ears up at and get excited about (and then some!).   Then there's the combat. It's fantastic. It's incredibly strategic in every aspect. Your first playthrough on Tactician will give you some good laughs at some of the difficulty you need to face and work around (this is a good thing! My boyfriend and I faced some extremely hilarious moments of trying to figure out a fight and failing miserably when we were learning the game, it was amazing fun). And then you enter the realm of searching out perfect gear, perfect min-maxing, perfect stats, and perfect combat. That, in itself, is the most enjoyable aspect of the combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2. You can hop from easier combat to the most intense combat the game offers, and it's all fun. I recently finished my solo Honour Mode, and it was definitely hard and an adventure and left me sitting during quite a few fights thinking out beforehand how I was going to handle them because even the smallest mistake can mess you up. I can go on and on about how amazing the combat is, but you really just need to delve into it yourself to truly see how remarkable it is. I can't find anything I enjoy as much as D:OS2's combat system anywhere else.  If you're looking for a game to literally lose yourself in for long periods of time, or to even play casually in your free time, this is definitely my go-to. This is just a masterpiece of a game, it's every fantasy and rpg player's dream come true. And did I mention the co-op is incredibly fun? Really, it's just a stunning piece of art.  Now, I have a great many pros for D:OS2, but I do have a few cons, and these are entirely subjective, and my own personal opinion.  I really don't enjoy the four-man party system. For someone like me, it's way too overwhelming managing four characters at all times, and I just don't like it. Because some best in slot gear pieces are unique and you won't find ANYTHING else with their bonuses on in the game (Second Skin, ihu), you're just sacrificing too much playing a full four-man. But that's from a min-maxing perspective, and probably not that important to others. The second part of why I don't like the four-man parties is because once you get a taste of the solid power of a Lone Wolf character, you really can't ever go back. Now this can be a good or bad thing. It gives the game a lot of replayable value, I'm about to hit my 5th playthrough and I'm finally needing to stray away from my babe Sebille ( ): ), which pushes me to pick other players to experience their stories.   With all that being said, this is definitely a game I recommend anyone to buy. It's amazing in every aspect. I absolutely cannot wait until the Definitive Edition either. And big, big props to Larian Studios for their choice to give the buyers of D:OS2 the Definitive Edition for free. Incredible company who listens to their audience. I can't wait to see what future games come!"

Zant,142,139,15,June 3,Recommended,180.9,"I cannot recommend this game enough. It is an RPG that breaks the boundaries of what you perceive an RPG to be. Every problem or puzzle has what feels like more solutions than you can conceive of. Original Sin 2 rewards clever thinking, tactics, and the role-playing itself over all else. Stat building and creating the ""perfect character"" is always a fun aspect of CRPGs but I'd say it's not the main focus here. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of numbers and plenty to min-max, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much damage you do if you're not in combat, and the game truly shines when you can avoid it.  Don't get me wrong, the combat in this game is fantastic. You can control all of your (up to 4) party members individually outside of combat and prepare the upcoming battlefield to your liking assuming you have the drop on your opponents. Place your archers up top, give your wizards ample space, have clean terrain for your warriors, e.t.c. However, when you find yourself able to circumvent combat, you'll be rewarded with a level of satisfaction very rare in games these days.  It constantly feels like Original Sin 2 almost dares you to break the game's boundaries. It challenges you to out-think the developers. Everything matters in this game. I'll leave you with an anecdote:  As I explored, searching for a quest target, I came upon a ruin. I saw a passage through, but in between it and myself were a few foes I was most certainly not equipped to handle at my current level. In other games I'd probably have left and came back later when I was a higher level, but not here. I navigated around the edges of the NPCs' detection radius in stealth with each of my characters individually until I found a minuscule spot I could teleport to that would get me past my foes. It was certainly inconvenient, but it worked - I painstakingly teleported each of my characters in turn to that one spot only to realize the one doing the teleporting was stuck below; the one casting the spell is unable to use it on themselves. After some hard thought I realized I could place the teleportation artifact close enough for my previously transported characters to grab. I then used it to pull my last hero past the baddies. I exhaled a sigh of relief and then panned the camera to see I had just come face-to-face with the very character I had been trying to track down. I was positively oozing with smugness."

saturn missiles,183,253,2,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,341.5,"Simply put, Divinity: Original Sin 2 expands on the best ideas from the first game while taking a complete 180 in tone to deliver a much darker and adult experience compared to the first.  One of the most notable changes is immediately realized as character creation begins, with races, tags, origin stories, and a complete stat revamp giving a new level of depth to character creation. The origin story presets, while not customizable, deliver a unique experience for each. All of the notable ""origin story"" characters have interactions with each other, and even if you choose not to create them yourself, they can be found and interacted with around the world. Not only this, but you can recruit these important figures of the lore. Origin stories on the surface level seem gimmicky, but allow for a whole new level of replayability, in combination with the tag system. The tag system allows you to acquire new tags that effect quests and dialogue as you progress through the game, or assign them to your custom character in character creation. ""Origin story"" characters will have these tags preset, as well as a brief synopsis of their lore.   However, the changes aren't just to the character creation. As soon as you get into combat, you'll quickly notice how much has changed. While Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps the basics of the first game intact, action points have recieved a complete overhaul, streamlining the process of choosing actions. While the new system (6 action points total; 4 action points at the start of encounter. Most skills cost 1-2 action points) may seem to cater to a more casual audience at first, the new skills that accompany this revamp allow for a level of complexity in combat never before seen in the Divinity series. New skills introduced in the second game are more ambitious, creative, and innovative than any in the first game. Even from the start of the game, you'll acquire interesting abilities that you can use to control the battlefield. The new targeting system provided in D:OS2 gives a sense of clarity lacking in the first game. Height advantages and disadvantages means that positioning matters now more than ever before. In addition to the ""surfaces"" system of the first game (fire, poison, poison clouds, static clouds, electrified water, etc), most of these surfaces can now be blessed and cursed for interesting variations and choice in combat. For example, while fire is harmful to your team, if you bless it, it'll apply a heal every turn and prevent the members within from being frozen.   The campaign here is of absolutely astounding quality and length - my first full playthrough of the game took roughly 80 hours, even without dozens of sidequests. No matter your choice of origin character or custom, you'll find the campaign to be deeply satisfying. However, as noted by the developers, you are meant to play with the origin story characters - and it shows. Each origin character has at least half a dozen unique encounters. While the game is still engaging if you're playing as a custom character, the origin stories really do allow for a better capacity for role playing and it's interaction in the game world.  For the Steam Awards of 2016, this is my pick for the Most Astounding Game. The staggering amount of interactions in the game, even in alpha, can be overwhelming. Divinity: Original Sin 2 could very well shape up to be Game of the Year 2017 for me."

The way spells and combat with your party work together is just amazing. It really opened my eyes and maybe once I am done with this one I will go back and play the first. Might do that now that there is a sale!  The story is well done so far and writing is top notch. Graphics are nice and the world seems so alive. So many side quests I am still in the first area.    Performance is great, I am getting solid FPS (between 80-120) all settings maxed out in 1440. The soundtrack is great as well.  Being fully voiced probably saved me for this game, I love reading but I hate reading in games, not sure I would have loved this as much as I do if it hadnt been voiced.  Voice acting is actually really good in this game.   Really looking forward to sinking tons of time into this game. ZERO regrets."

Ex Nihiloish,295,"2,143",827,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,220.5,"I'm 72 years old and these have been the best 20 hours of my life.  EDIT:: After playing through the game multiple times, including finishing it on Honour Mode, I have to say that my opinion of this game is even higher than it was after those first 20 hours. After finishing this game, it feels like my life is complete and there's nothing left to live for. This may be the last game I ever play and review I ever write. I would like to thank Larian for filling a void that has been plaguing me for more than half a century.  I found the main story as well as every single side quest/story to be fun and interesting. There are no boring fetch quests as far as I can tell. How you handle side quests and whether you complete them or not 'does' affect the ending; as such, they could be considered extensions of the main story. (You could be unsatisfied with the ending if you just rush through and skip things.)  You can build your characters any way you see fit and almost any build is completely viable. If you don't like the way you built your characters, just wait until you complete Act 1 and you can rebuild them any way you want as frequently as you want all the way up to the very end of the game; this is very good for testing new things out. By the end of the game my main character was a fire breathing Geo/Pyro battle mage that wielded a fire staff, used Warfare skills and showered my enemies in meteors with some necromancy for physical damage in case the enemy had too much resistance to those elements; she was pretty godly. I plan on trying a solo Honour mode run next with a similar but more diverse build. (I love the lizards!)  For me, the best part of this game is the combat. It's extremely well done and very fun. I can't really say any more than what the other reviews cover though. Just know that if a fight seems absolutely impossible, that it really isn't. I've gone into fights where half my party was annihilated before I got to do anything, yet I still emerged victorious. There's always a way to win even if the enemy has you outnumbered and outleveled; just gotta think!  Like many reviews state, there are still some bugs. As far as I can tell, they are all minor. After multiple play throughs on multiple difficulties I have not experienced any major bugs. Nothing game breaking and nothing that really affected my gameplay much.  The few bugs I've experienced:  - Many unvoiced lines in Arx.  - Incorrect journal entries.  - Sometimes a character would act blind in combat even though they weren't (could't use any ranged skills, couldn't see around themselves, but this was rare and only lasted a single turn.)  - Sometimes the enemy AI would derp out and they'd just run around or repeatedly climb up and down a ladder until they were out of AP.  - Custom undead characters do not receive the appropriate immunities, such as bleeding and suffocation. (though I don't recall any of my characters ever being afflicted with Bleed...) (Fane does receive these immunities)  - Undead afflicted with Decay will not attempt to avoid poison puddles (Not sure if this is a bug or an oversight).  - Altitude does not affect many player or enemy melee attacks. (Entities 10+ meters above can be struck with melee.) But it does affect some skills, such as Dragon's Blaze, Laser Ray, charging skills, Battle Stomp, etc.  ... I think that's about it. I'll add more if I remember them.  Some reviews complain about enemies being omniscient and knowing all of your strengths and weaknesses (including whether you're undead or not), which is true, but it's also true for players. Any player with Loremaster on one of their characters can examine any NPC or enemy to gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Only one of your characters needs Loremaster. If you examine with someone that doesn't have it, they use the skill level of whoever does, even if that person is dead. (This even works on the final boss, at no point in the game is it unfair that enemies can spot your weaknesses.)  So in summary, very fun game, great character customization, great combat, good story, a few minor bugs. It can be challenging in some scenarios but it's supposed to be; that's at least half the fun. I could mention the poor inventory management but countless reviews already cover that.  Tip: Carry a couple pieces of +Thievery and +Loremaster gear with you to make sure you can pick any lock and identify any item. There may be times when your base skill isn't sufficient.   TL;DR: Recommended, as shown above. 10/10 on the Completely Subjective, Arbitrary and Useless rating system."
TeaBagTom,146,63,1,"September 28, 2016",Recommended,68.3,"Ok...so beat act 1, and holy♥♥♥♥♥♥larian out did themselves. Everything from the atmosphere to the character building has been improved, using the same formula as before and making every aspect better. The combat is the same style but with many subtle at first differences that expand into a lot more combat flexibility.   Update (Release): The game has finally released and I really have to say...Larian has out-done themselves. Playing through the game on Tactician and seeing how the AI does its best to break the combat system like a real player would, ending their turn with their back to a wall so your rogue is inefective, reversing your moves by throwing water on the enemy you just shocked and stunning your entire party, it's an incredible system that Larian has created so much flexibility, every move of every fight becomes a question of ""did that just happen? can I really do this?"" which is something no other game can capture.  Gone are the supercharged ridiculous characters of the first game, replaced with smarter and more adept enemies that force you to make better decisions. The flexibility in character creation and the much more intuitive world makes me excited every chance I get to jump on and uncover just a bit more of the world. The inclusion of a darker story and races adds a much needed party diversity and the lore being less silly pulls you in far more to the atmosphere (which is beautiful...from the musical score to the graphics) creating a much more enjoyable transition from combat to exploring, and giving you more to WANT to explore.   The beautiful score and excellent voice acting talent (so far) has been an incredible treat in an age when games have been spending less and less time and devotion to world building and character development. The party while smaller than some CRPGs, is fully fleshed out with interesting characters who I actually want to talk to and interact with.  So far I am incredibly excited with the release and looking forwarding to simply getting through ACT 1 on tactician and exploring the unknown. Well done Larian, you have brought art back into the gaming industry."
AKatarzynaK,681,152,4,"October 21, 2017",Recommended,114.5,"This is without a doubt one of the best RPGs I have ever played and after completing it I can honestly say it has secured its place among my top favorite games of all time.   When beginning the game you have the option of creating your own character or choosing from one of several premade characters, each with their own unique backstories and questlines. I highly recommend going this route as these characters and their quests are very well written and interesting. I found myself extremely invested in my main character (Lohse) and what would become of her and her companions. It's also really interesting witnessing the members of your party, each with their own motivations and biases, try to work together while also clashing as they look out for their own best interests. Each character is so well written and perfectly voice acted that it really helped make what is already such an immersive game feel even more alive. The dialogue is great, whether it be the main characters or random NPCs, it really feels like everyone has their own unique personality.  The gameplay is incredibly fun, and I really can't think of the last time I had such a hard time putting down a game. You are given a lot of freedom, leaving it entirely up to you how you choose to progress throughout the world. There are often numerous ways to complete one task, depending on just how creative or good/evil you want to be. To add to this, the choices you make actually have consequences, and sometimes the line between what is right and what is wrong might not be so clear. So you will sometimes find that a decision you made might come back to haunt you in one way or another. I loved this and it was really cool seeing how some of the choices I made previously came to have a much wider impact than I had originally imagined.  The turn-based combat system is really well done and there are lots of ways in which you can get creative and use the environment to your advantage. Each battle is well designed and interesting, with each type of enemy presenting their own unique strengths and weaknesses. You have to really put some thought into exactly how you design your group, providing for a nice amount of strategy both in and out of battle. If you find that you have messed up your build there is an option to respec, something which I think most of us can appreciate for its ability to save us a lot of wasted time.  It is also worth mentioning that there are quite a few options as far as difficulty. I did my first playthrough on Classic, which is the default difficulty, and found it to be perfect for me. There were a few fights which I struggled on, but anytime I faced such a roadblock I found that all I needed to achieve victory was to simply reevaluate my strategy. Personally I love just how rewarding of a feeling this can be, and I look forward to doing future playthrough on the harder difficulties. However if you're someone who is looking for less of a hassle, you will be happy to find that the lower difficulty, Explorer, will allow you to simply enjoy the ride without any frustration.  The quests are extremely fun and varied, some of which require solving puzzles, riddles, or getting a bit more creative with your abilities and items. One thing I really loved about the quest system is that it doesn't hold your hand, meaning that unlike some RPGs that basically give you a GPS tracker showing you exactly where you need to go, this game tends to just point you in a general direction and expect you to figure it out on your own. Now if this is offputting to you, please know I am speaking as someone with a truly awful sense of direction. I had a ton of fun with this and found that getting lost while trying to find where I needed to go to next provided for some of my favorite moments. Some of the random encounters you come across as you explore are the most surprising and rewarding experiences in the game.   The attention to detail is truly incredible and the world really feels so alive. Even areas that at first glance appear to be devoid of life might have something hidden. Especially with the pet pal ability, which allows you to talk to animals, or spirit vision which allows you to see/speak to ghosts, you'll find that if you look close enough there is no shortage of things to be seen or done. And to top this all off the soundtrack is incredible, providing the perfect music to accompany you on what is truly an epic journey.  The universe that Larian have built here is absolutely astounding and they managed to pack so much into this game that it's honestly a bit overwhelming at times. Between all of the characters and their questlines, the decisions you have to make throughout the game, and the sheer size of the world, it's truly impossible to take it all in on just one run. Speaking as someone who rarely plays games a second time, I'm already gearing up for my second trip into Divinity Original Sin 2 and imagine I'll be making even more eventually.   Now that I've ranted and raved about just how much I adore this game I must point out really the only negative thing I have to say about it, and that is just how buggy it can be. During the course of my 111 hour playthrough I ran into a number of bugs, ranging from mildly annoying to gamebreaking. The biggest one, of course, being the gamebreaking bug which made it impossible for me to enter into a room you need to use to begin the final quest. In order to get around this I had to get a bit creative and basically stack items until I could get one of my characters to glitch into said room, then allowing the rest of my party to teleport to me. While I am obviously pleased that I was able to get past this annoying bug, I can't help but be frustrated that such a problem would even exist in the first place. For as much as I love this game some of the bugs I faced really took away from my overall enjoyment and I truly hope Larian will patch them as soon as possible. Of course I'm sure there are those who played the game without facing bugs, but it doesn't change the fact that I was unfortunate enough to encounter them and that some of you might as well.   Overall I truly love this game and believe it deserves all of the praise it is getting. As I mentioned, my one and only complaint are some of the bugs I encountered. While frustrating, such issues can easily be fixed through a patch. And it does speak to just how captivating I found this game to be that I continued to press on despite these issues. There is absolutely no denying that this was a game crafted with a lot of love, and so I have complete faith that Larian will continue to be very active in it post release. If you're on the fence than I suggest you wait a bit to buy, but I imagine it won't take long for these issues to be fixed. For 45 Euro I managed to get one of the most amazing gaming experiences I have ever had and I encourage everyone who is interested to give it a try. This game is a masterpiece, plain and simple."
Sam Crow,258,129,1,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,150.4,"Hands down one of the best CRPGs in recent history. I'm willing to say I liked this even more than Pillars of Eternity, and I'm a Infinity Engine RPG nut.  It's a bit different than your classic CRPG, the main story doesn't seem that extraordinary, but it grows on you. It's not what makes the game good. The journey is.  - You have multiple ways to achieve things. Want to steal a chest without being seen? Teleport it away from affar. Want to blow up a door but it has too much HP? Blow it up with an explosive barrel.  Want to escape a keep of evil clerics? Well I'll let you figure that one out for yourself, you'll have many ways to chose from. - The voice acting is great considering how little budget they had compared to triple A companies. - Every NPC has something to say.  - The writting is just right, and very immersive. - Remember the combat in Torment:Tides of Numenera? Wipe that nightmare out of your memory with the combat in this game. It's fun, complex and actually makes  you look forward to battles. - Each companion is unique and complex. Great char development as well as you proggress.  I could go on for ages. The bottom line is they have outdone themselves immensly with this game.  Go buy it and support Larian so they can make more.

Retrotus,222,172,6,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,38.7,"If you want good old classical RPG feel that does not kill your smart with stupid RNG, If you want something that is not just rush in and kill everything and be a godlike all the time, if you really think that games nowadays has made you dumb and numb, then Divinity 2 is for you.  For example my experience so far has been..  I chose tactician difficulty as it said enemies will use tricks that they wont otherwise. i played few hours and was about to lower my difficulty from tactician and now i'm glad that i did not. It really makes you save scumming A LOT, but other hand it forces you to learn some dirty tricks to defeat enemies as they really do some dirty hoccus poccus to you. The difficulty lives by it name 100% in this game imo  It forces you kind a explore world more to find out ways to beat something that serves your royal head in a plate.. And when you do that you find some many interesting stuff from the game world that you would probably just missed. Mostly in other games exploring just feels kind a work but not in this one, it's rewarding  There has been many fights that i had to delay due lvl difference and bad gear, Fights that i need to find an alternative way to approach. Some situations feels so unfair until you really think it through. For me it is just pure joy, wanted so long something that is not just blatant rush in and slice everything or that stupid RNG kills your smart moves, it's you and your stupid moves and strategies what gets you killed.. and ofc i can blame a bit other games that has made your brain so dry for new ideas ;)  Same style goes with conversations. Listen what they have to say, it might help you later.. No it will help you later. Books, notes etc is rewarding to read as they can have life saving info or ways to unlock some puzzles later on. Sometimes even info about NPCs in game world wich you can use to get their favor in conversation. No, the game does not unlock conversation choises when you find info about people. For long time i haven't read so many diaries in game that i have in this game so far! Voice acting is not annoying to listen. DOS1 gave me that feel i was listening shakespeare but in this on they nailed it.  What i can say...  The victory is like drug now,  every nook and corner is my friend,  every item that is not nailed down is my salary or key to success,  every book or note makes me a bit more aware of the world in game. every stronger enemies that slain my team is like tasty revange when you come to beat them later on!  10/10 in my book  PS. if you are new to Divinity Orginal Sin, Tactician difficulty can be a bit harsh first ;)"
Riptide,61,248,8,August 4,Recommended,195.5,"After playing this game for a few weeks, I can say that DOS2 has replaced Skyrim as my all time favorite RPG. It's that good.  Pros: Voice acting, graphics, ""turn based"" combat, immersion factors all get a solid 10. I haven't finished the game, but so far the story is interesting, and even if the story ending stinks, it still has that draw you in factor. As for re-playability, it's already apparent to me that I'll have to play it again with the other available characters so I can experience their stories. There is the main story line, and each of the 5 pre-created characters have their own stories. I chose to create my own character, which means I have 3 of the 5 available pre-created characters as my compatriots, each with their own stories to be completed. With my current playthough, I'm not going to know how Sebille or Lohse's stories finish out. They're not in my party so, I gotta play again with them to find out how their stories end.  An EXTREMELY well crafted RPG. This one is a clear and unmistakable winner. Kudos to Larian for self-publishing to avoid the pressure to release the game before they completed what they intended the game to be. You guys got it correct.  Although I'm not a fan of third person, overlooking the party, view point games (I prefer first person... eyeballs forward),  this one succeeds in grasping my attention and refusing to let it go. I'm drawn in, focused, worried, and sssso happy when a fight is over and all the characters under my control are still alive, I'm almost bouncing up and down in my seat ready for the loot.   It's a blast to play!   The only downside I've felt so far - and it's not really terrible - is inventory management. There's a load of stats, and as with any RPG, we all want all the stats to be as high as possible. Well, it ain't gonna happen. There's the agonizing struggle around applying the puny number of level up points to a plethora of possibilities. And, the loot that's uncovered has a variety of statistical applications that can be distributed to... well... do I want this? Who best to give it to? Arrrrgh! I like those extra points with that, but this one has these two stats.... which one to choose? Maybe I could give it to this character... but then I lose those stats. Grrrrr! Maybe I should keep it for later on? No. Maybe I'll just sell it. No... should I wait? Maybe it'll be useful in this situation? What... ever.... should.... I... do??? **blank it*** I'll just sell it. No, I'll keep it for later. ARRRGH!!!  It's involved, at times frustrating, and can be overly time consuming. There's so many items that can enhance a variety of disparet statistics, it can be overwhelming. It's like a 20 page menu of delicious food at a great restaraunt to a starving man. I WANT IT ALL!!!  I've always been of the opinion that less is more. This game does not embrace that. There's a lot of items, that do a lot of different things, and I've probably spent more time trying to figure out who should get what, for the maximum impact, than I've spent exploring.  I'm not really unhappy about that though. For me, it's at most a minor annoyance. There is a crafting mechanism that I could take a deep dive into, which some people will do because they like exploring that type of mystery. Me? I try not to be an item hoarding ♥♥♥♥♥, but ultimately I lose out on certain discoveries. But hey, it's all good y'know? I may miss out on a side quest here or there, but there's too much other content to discover so even though I've ""broken"" a few side quests so far, I've forgotten about them so I just press onward with the quests that are currently before me.  Let me put it this way: Inventory management can be tedious, but if you ""explore"" it, certain items can open additional quests. Sheesh! As if there wasn't enough to do already!  Oh, and if you put a point into Pet Pal, you can talk to the animals. Which open up probably a few dozen side quests to have fun with. I mean, why wouldn't you? There's only a hundred quests along the way, so why not open up a few dozen more??? Awww... go on! You got the time!  This game is easily worth the current price of around $40. My favorite gaming experiences have been with RPG's, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now my favorite of all time.  Well done Larian!"
Emperor Gandhi,281,137,2,May 20,Recommended,104.4,"Like my reviews? Go follow my Curator page.   As a younger gamer, I never got to experience games like Diablo 2 or Baldur's Gate in their prime, and by the time I was old enough to understand and appreciate the RPG genre, the gaming industry moved onto 3D, first/third-person RPGs like Fallout 3 and Oblivion. Eventually, CRPGs made a comeback, and I jumped onto that hype train only to be pretty disappointed. As other CRPGs haven't quite hit the spot for me, I saw this game get released on Steam and chose not to buy it because I thought I'd be underwhelmed yet again.  That was a huge mistake. While Divinity: Original Sin 2 suffers from some very serious flaws, the game's strengths are done so well that the fairly popular claim that this game is one of the ""best RPGs of all time"" is completely justified.  Graphics As was the case with the first game, the visuals are surprisingly pretty. Even though the overall tone of this game is rather dark (especially compared to D:OS 1) it still retains some of the first game's light-hearted charm and this can be reflected in the bright, cartoony visuals. The main characters are all interesting and unique visually, and the character creation system itself is incredibly deep from an appearance standpoint. Aside from some occasional frame drops, the game is pretty impressive visually.  Gameplay Divinity: Original Sin 2's biggest strength, one that makes it one of the all-time greats, is its incredible amount of player choice. This is reflected in almost every aspect of the game. The addition of physical and magic armor means that you're going to need to think a little bit more when it comes to party composition and prioritizing targets, while simply stunlocking an enemy to death isn't as effective now. On top of this, with the sheer amount of skills in the game, there are so many different ways to approach a situation. For example, you could hack away at a troll, or you could turn him into a chicken and teleport him into a pit of lava. Or, you could summon a monster (one that's just as large as that troll) on top of a fire, causing the monster to be infused with fire, and have the two duke it out with each other. The variety in skills adds so much depth to the already refined turn-based combat mechanics of the first game. While some skills and talents are better than others, the classes overall are pretty fairly balanced and offer you a lot of wiggle room to make your characters more well-rounded, and the weaker skills/talents are still playable at least. The game is also difficult, but it very rarely felt unfair. Even then, thanks to the incredible amount of choice in this game, you can easily exploit these unfair fights. Where the game falls flat gameplay-wise, however, is the final boss. Without going into spoilers, it takes the biggest strengths of this game and throws them out the window, turning into an absolute mess where you barely get to do anything. Overall though, aside from the final boss, everything in the gameplay department is perfect. The combat mechanics are deep and incredibly fun, the game overall is mostly fairly balanced, the armor system makes the game more interesting, and the sheer amount of choice makes just about anything possible. The gameplay alone makes this game worthwhile at full price, and the enhanced edition should (hopefully) make it even better.  Story Unfortunately, on the other end of the spectrum, the weakest part of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is its story. While the writing is good and the pacing starts off fairly consistent, this all goes out the window for the last third of the game. From the big climax in Act 3 and onward, the pacing goes all over the place. Act 3 as a whole is over extremely quickly, while Act 4 is drawn out some more but still fairly easy to blow through. As mentioned before, the final boss takes the biggest strengths and throws them out the window, and this includes the writing. As an example of this, one of my party members told my character that he would support me no matter what decision I made, only to get mad at me for choosing something he apparently didn't support. This happened over the span of about 30 seconds, and I'm not exaggerating that either. All of the character development of your party members is thrown aside for some reason, and it makes the finale that much more frustrating. On top of this, none of the endings are satisfying. While I understand the approach they tried to take, the drop in quality of the writing made all of them feel stupid and nullified all the progress you made in the game. However, everything else is great. Fort Joy was brilliant, and I loved watching the island slowly open up for you to explore as you escaped it. Driftwood, while definitely a lot slower paced, was filled to the brim with entertaining quests and the classic D:OS charm. Plus, the amount of player choice is also reflected here. You can talk your way out of a situation in a wide variety of different ways, and your decisions do have weight to them. Overall, while the first two acts of the game are incredible, the last two are not as great and will likely leave you disappointed.  Audio Remember how I said that almost everything in this game could be changed by the player? Well I wasn't kidding. You can choose your character's instrument, which plays during the battle (to the music) when you kill an enemy. I also personally find it pretty impressive how much of this game is voice acted. With the exception of a few conversations, almost everything has competent voice acting. Another pleasant suprise was how much I enjoyed the soundtrack. While I liked the first game's music, not much stuck out for me aside from the classic tavern music and the main menu theme. In this game, however, I found myself humming along to music like the Lady Vengeance theme and the tavern battle theme. While neither of these things are major highlights to the game, they're both done very well and do make the experience significantly more entertaining as a result.  Replayability As choice is this game's biggest strength, the replayability for D:OS 2 is very high, moreso than most other RPGs in my opinion. There's no way you can see or do everything in a single playthorugh, plus the party member quests are entertaining enough that you'll probably want to see them through for every character. Plus, with the inclusion of the excellent Game Master mode, even if you don't do multiple playthroughs of the game, you'll be spending hours on top of hours in this game. There's so many different combinations of classes and skills that experimenting is incredibly fun, and so you'll definitely have a lot of motivation to play through the game again.  Verdict To conclude, while Divinity: Original Sin 2 suffers from things like frame drops and an incredibly weak finale, the game's strengths overshadow its weaknesses so much that I still wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who might even be remotely interested. People weren't kidding, this truly is one of the best RPG games ever made, and the enhanced edition has the potential to make it the best.

I'm quite envious of the fact that I was not involved with the design of this game. It has exceeded my expectations and provided me with many hours of gaming pleasure.

Damashi The Kaotic,89,114,8,"June 24, 2017",Recommended,"1,284.0","Play it...just play it. This is easily one of the greatest rpgs ever made, and I would recomend it to litteraly everyone. If you like a great story, great turn based combat with an insane amount of depth, and beautiful visuals, you will fall in love with this game as much as I did.  I've played through DOS1/DOS EE around 7 times, and while the story in that game was unintresting, the gameplay alone kept me coming back. DOS2, even in its alpha state, is a vast improvement over DOS1/DOS EE in everyway.  Kill whoever you want, steal whatever isn't nailed down, Dos2 gives more freedom than any rpg to date.  *Slight Spoilers*: You can kill the gaurds on the boat, and the game has dialouge to reflect that you did. You can also kill your companions on the boat or leave them to die, and there is special dialouge for both of these actions.  Update: After having finished the full game I can safely say this is my favorite rpg of all time, period. Larian did an icredible job with this game, and its very obvious just how much love and care went into this game.  Update as of Nov 24th 2017: I've now put in over 600 hours in and I still can't stop playing it. When I'm not playing it I'm think about, and if that's not an indication of this game's quality I don't know what is. This is my game of the century, and Larian Studios has given me hope for the game industry. This is a must buy, especially if you want to give the middle finger to scummy publishers who fill their games with microtransactions, loot boxes, and other anti consumer pratices. A few bugs here and there, but nothing that truly detracts from the over all experience, and the game is patched roughly once, and Larian is one of the few publishers that I trust to fix everything (even if things that are wrong are miniscule)."

wcis,339,100,3,"November 7, 2017",Recommended,151.6,"An adventure! If I had to describe Divinity: Original Sin 2 in a word, that would be it. An adventure. Without a doubt, it’s the best modern cRPG game up to date. And as an oldschool gamer, I can understand when someone is saying that nothing can stand in one line with games like Planescape: Torment or Baldur’s Gate. Well, it couldn’t. Until now. Times changing, and so gaming industry is changing. And we have just received the best, most polished cRPG game ever made. It has to be said, even if we are sentimental.   The world of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is full of content and what’s the best, we can interact with almost everything and everyone. There are no boring NPC’s with exactly the same dialogue lines. In this game everyone is unique and has something to say. Also, we are talking here about huge cRPG game that is fully voice acted (!) and it’s not Oblivion-like voice acting with 5 actors. The main narrator, who is with us most of the time, and all the other voice actors, did an outstanding job here. Every character sounds special.  If you have played first Original Sin you know what to expect from fights. They can be approached in many different ways. Even in tough fights, one properly used scroll or skill can change everything. Of course in both ways, because we can easily lose. The fights are hard, made to think in strategic ways and what’s the most important, they are very satisfying. Comparing to other cRPG games it’s one of the best parts of Divinity.  It took me roughly 105 hours to finish the game once, so it can be said that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the biggest cRPG games. What’s more, this game has high replayability value. Every character has its own personality and its own origin story. By playing with different characters we have new quests and we can approach many situations in totally different way – origin characters have their own interactions across whole game. The main story is interesting and I have never lost my interest. I don’t want to spoil anything, but it’s just really good piece of writing. Side quests are keeping high level as well. Same as in first Original Sin, we also receive minimal amount of help in all the quests. We have to think, search and read. Just like in real cRPG game.  I have completed this game few days ago and to be honest, I can’t wait to play it again. I am thinking about new characters and about making different decisions in several points of the game. It’s something amazing. There are many huge games, like The Witcher 3 or Fallout 4 that can give you +/- 100 hours of actual playtime, but those are mostly single experience games. You are not playing them again. There is something different in Divinity that make you want to play it again. More and more! In Civilization series we are saying about “one more turn” syndrome. Here we have “one more hour”, “one more evening” and “one more day syndrome”!  There are no perfect, 10/10 games, and there is no difference here. The game is quite fresh, so there are still bugs. I haven’t experienced any gamebreaking bug though, but there are many small things that for sure will be fixed in the future. What’s more, the final act and final battle are both the weakest parts of the game. You can feel that devs were in hurry here, but on the other side, whole game is so good, that this “rushed” ending won’t outshine beautiful, interesting and so carefully designed game. It simply can’t.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is, in my humble opinion, the best game of year 2017. Let’s just hope we will see more cRPG’s like this in the future (Obsidian, we are looking at you). Do yourself a favour and buy this game. It will be the best +/- 100 hours you can have as a gamer. And for this price, that is not even close to the other ""AAA"" titles with unhealthy DLC policy, it's a steal.   Whoop. We've got quite a long review here! Enjoy the game! :)  9+/10  EDIT: Found typo."
Metsakurat,"1,205",47,0,October 17,Recommended,120.7,"A masterpiece It took me around 100 hours to finish the game. The world of Rivellon is both big and alluring. It was a joy to explore every single corner of it. Each battle was challenging, fun, made me use different tactics and I never got tired of fighting. The game balances roleplaying and combat perfectly. In some RPGs the combat is fine but the story and characters are what keep you playing. However in Original Sin 1 I didn't really care for the story while Original Sin 2 kept me interested at all times. It really improves on the lore, roleplaying and combat. It's definitely a good sequel and one of the best games of 2017.  I only have two complaints: Romance had no effect on the ending and the amount of puzzles in the game. It would have taken me A LOT more than 100 hours to finish the game because of the puzzles.  Now don't get me wrong. The puzzles are all interesting and well executed. There are some simple puzzles, moderate and very hard ones. I just don't have too much time to play video games and since there are so many puzzles in the game I had to resort to using Google way more than I'd like to admit. Now the romance and with it some minor spoilers ahead. I decided to romance Lohse. At the end of the game she asked me if I would like to travel the world with her and I can't answer her. All I can do is end the conversation and in the final cutscene the narrator tells me that she spent the rest of her life traveling Rivellon alone.  Just dissapointing.  But what is the game about? What's the story like? You have the ability to use Source - A powerful and outlawed magic. Magic used by the gods themselves. It's what gives them power. The game starts with you being captured by Magisters who hunt and imprison everyone who can use Source. They take you to an isolated prison island. While there you make new friends, discover an unbelievable truth about yourself and make interesting alliances while trying to escape the island. You will meet dragons, witches, paladins, underground fighting arenas, demons, trolls, ghosts and much, much more. You will also uncover conspiracies and astonishing secrets. Will you be the new Divine?  The game itself plays alot like the recent XCOM games. It's basically a turn-based roleplaying game. Not to worry tho. You can still create a custom character and choose their stats, race, gender, and origin story or you can simply choose one of the pre-made characters. There's a wide variety of classes to choose from as well. All your favourate melee, ranged and magic classes are there. It also has Steam Workshop and modders have made some really interesting class mods that are worth checking out. However, if you enable mods you are not able to earn achivements. This, in my humble opinion, is a bit foolish. It's a singleplayer game and I should be allowed to have my fun however I want. The trainers still work and it has no leaderboards in it so I don't really support disabling achivements for mod users. It's a minor complaint but a complaint nonetheless.  The game is well optimised and ran at a solid 60 frames per second at all times. I did experience two crashes during my playthrough but other than that I really didn't notice any other bugs or issues. Visually the game is lovely to look at and the soundtrack is marvelous. Don't go into it expecting remarkable next gen graphics though.  It's a game I most definitely won't forget any time soon. I want a sequel and I want it now! A must play for every roleplaying fan and fans of the turn-based genre should give it a go as well. Well done, Larian Studios, well done. "

Shard of Manus,41,75,1,March 13,Recommended,177.4,"Divinity Original Sin 2 - Larian's second foray into the grand re-imagining of the Divinity universe, and one can only say... they really outdid themselves this time.   Larian Studios takes a bold step into the old RPG style that players were so enamoured by with the original Divine Divinity, only with all the polish of modern capabilities, and the extremely successful and informative release of Divinity Original Sin (and its Enhanced Edition) granting them insight into the necessary improvements that make DOS2 the absolute masterpiece that it is.   Players can be sure to find themselves trapped within this game for such lengths of time that the outside world shall begin to pass by unnoticed, as one becomes so transfixed with the beauty of Larian's latest release. Divinity Original Sin 2 is perhaps the most engaging, exciting, satisfying and well-designed Adventure RPG of the decade... and that is quite the title to fight for.   -----------------   The world of DOS2 is massive. Hours upon hours upon hours of dense, creative and unique content stacked together in this vibrant and stunning game world. Every location itself is chock full of fantastic characters, all fully voiced with quality acting, and each with a rich and realistic personality and story that drive the player's desire to uncover every ounce of their story and build upon the deep lore and sprawling history of the world of Divinity.   The main campaign spans four Acts, each filled to the brim with hours of non-linear content including side quests, treasure hunts, battles, secrets to be uncovered and more all with multiples ways to be completed and numerous outcomes - and with such immense amounts of freedom and player choice, the likes of which almost no modern game can compete with, there really is no dull moment in Divinity, and this game is a shining example of the effort and dedication Larian puts into their work.   -----------------   The combat of DOS2 has been revamped since the previous release, though maintaining much of what it once was. Divinity Original Sin 2, like its predecessor, adopts turn-based combat, and turns it into one of the most finely crafted and perfect editions of this style of combat to date. Every moment of battle is exciting and even for one such as I, whom rarely plays turn-based games, the combat was astoundingly well designed and thoroughly enjoyable.   Players command all manner of skills thanks to the diverse customisation options available and freedom of choice, with crafting bombs, traps, potions, poisons, arrows and much, much more, players will always find themselves with an array of tools with which to combat the enemy. No class is tied to any particular tree of skills, and one can mix and match as they see fit... provided they learn how to best use such abilities.   DOS2 encourages interactivity with the environment, and players have much freedom to use objects, terrain and combinations of attacks for devastating effects. If there is oil, set it ablaze. If there is water, freeze it so that your enemies slip. The combinations are many, and are far deeper and complex than just those above. This game holds some of the most complex and intriguing combat systems I know.   Combat is by no means forgiving, and the game boasts a variety of difficulty options that make enemies easier, or expand their skills sets and AI intelligence such as that they pose worthy adversaries to even well skilled players.   -----------------   Something brought to players for the first time in Divinity Original Sin makes its triumphant return in DOS2, and that is the wonderfully designed multiplayer aspect. Drop-in / drop-out co-op allows players to seamlessly enter the world of another player and join them on their journey... be they ally or foe.   The multiplayer system is beyond extensive, and to the delight of some players, and the woe of others, players can act as friend or foe on their journey - and betrayal is a sweet thing.   The absolute freedom of the multiplayer system does have its faults however, as playing with strangers can sometimes lead to them rushing through things, progressing without you or making choices that you didn't want to make. It is highly recommended that players save co-op until after their first playthrough, or only play with friends that one can communicate with easily and rely on. DOS2s world is too big and too grand to risk someone spoiling it for you.   However, in my experience, playing DOS2 with a friend or two (or 3) is an inimitable experience that all should try. Working together or against one another towards the finale of this game is thrilling beyond imagination.   -----------------   So, alongside the beautifully crafted world, intricate characters, massive freedom of choice, expansive customisation and awesome combat, Divinity Original Sin 2, much like other installments in the series, boasts an amazing soundtrack.   Composed by Borislav Slavov, DOS2s soundtrack combines epic scores, emotional pieces and the jovial warmth of tavern music in one of the best compositions of the year and even beyond, rivalling that of Hollow Knight, NieR: Automata and potentially even the Witcher 3.   With traditional styles of RPG music reminiscent of golden oldies, each with its own unique flair and spark, and returning tracks from other Divinity titles, the music of Larian's latest game is something no-one will not enjoy. Hours of beautiful tracks, some of which are placed so heart-wrenchingly well within the game world that you will no doubt be straight onto YouTube and listening to the whole lot for hours.   With everything else DOS2 has to offer, the Soundtrack really is the cherry on top, and it is something to behold.   -----------------   To summarise Divinity Original Sin 2 into one word, it would have to be... brave. Larian Studios started the development of this game precariously, via Kickstarter backing; and after the amazing success of Divinity Original Sin, they had certainly garnered enough interest to support their new installment. Their return to old school RPG styles was a risk that paid off... not because the style is popular, but because Larian took something good, and turned it into something beyond great.   DOS2 is, and will no doubt remain for some time, among my favourite games of all time. I have sunk so many hours into this game, through several playthroughs and still each new one is unique and engaging. Here is a timeless game. Play it, with all my heart, I tell you to play it."
Squeaks,60,64,5,February 19,Recommended,77.4,"I am a very casual gamer. I played WoW many years ago obsessively, and since then have really only gotten into a couple of flings with games. As someone who works full time, I don't have the time (or, honestly, the interest) in playing a game that requires me to play ALL THE TIME to keep up with everyone else. Adversely, I'm usually pretty bored with single player games.  I also hate turn-based games.  Despite that, I was browsing the most-purchased in the Steam store and decided on buying this game after reading the reviews.   This game took me about a month to complete, and I clocked in 75 hours. I can't even remember the last time a campaign took me more than 8 hours.... I actually was interested in what NPC's had to say, talked to everyone, opened every chest, etc. Not because I felt I had to, but because I really loved the game that much. Also, if I had played this game without looking up most of the quests online, it would've taken me at least double that time.  The combat was super fun, even though it was turn based. I was constantly looking for new spellbooks, planning out my rotations, etc.  It was also challenging - I really had to make sure my party was well-equipped and balanced in their abilities.  There were some fights I had to retry a few times, and it felt like more of a fun challenge than a tedious part of the gameplay.    After finishing the game, I'm going to go back and replay it a second time with a different strategy and a slightly higher difficulty.  I loved everything about this game, even though it's not my usual style of game at all - anyone who's on the fence, I definitely recommend it!"

Excellence in story craft like this happens once a generation, so don't miss it. Also, whatever you do, DO NOT go for spoilers of any kind. Just take some time off work and play this game... trust me.  The only danger here is that after I finished the game, I kinda feel like I'm done with gaming. I feel... complete, like every game I ever played was building up to this and nothing could ever be better than Divinity 2 (particularly Lohse's story arc). So, keep that in mind.

iingaate,72,223,3,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,143.3,"First time reviewing a game, but felt I should on this one. I never did play the first game though heard good things about it, so figured give the second a run. So far...even in early access I can't say I was disappointed. The game it's self reminds me of classic computer RPGs and pen 'n paper RPGs I played when I was much younger just a bit more fair and easier to understand yet still maintaining a lot of what made them challenging. Character customization starts a bit limited but as you get higher in levels its more about what you want to play and what your party members be. You are not locked into your starting class at all and I love that, hoping they have a lot more choices in the full release.   Gameplay wise is point and click, though I found there is a lot to interact with in the world in different ways, one of the more different ways I found was that playing an Elf or having an Elf in your group, the elf can eat a corpse and gain the memories of that person, and it actually does play a part in the game. Combat is much of the same, point and click with a lot of tactical choices to make, the enemy AI is well refined and act in actually very smart ways even on the easier difficulties. I also found it pretty neat how your spells, items and attacks can change the battle ground and make hazards for yourself and your enemies, with the enemies able to do the same. Such as freezing a wet spot on the ground to give a chance of someone slipping on the spot or shocking the water with lighting to stun everyone standing in the wet spot. Though at times at least for me I found it hard to move to avoide these hazards at times like the area they were affecting were slightly larger than they really were.  I even tried a bit of co-op with friends and a bit hidden in a sense once we figured it out, connecting with one another was clean and easy to do.   Storywise I found interesting enough, a dark world with many dark themes with demons, torture and corruption. The premade characters have backgrounds and behave well according to their backgrounds. Another different system in this game is the tag system. Basicly pick tags for your character and you will have in game choices that you can make based just on those tags you pick. The pre mades having different choices as well they can make based on their stand alone backgrounds. Though it does feel you can get same results no matter your background still, it does help with immersion and at in making your created character feel seprate from the rest.   Graphics, are not that important to me, but they are decent enough in this game. Though playing completely zoomed out (pretty much the only way to play an RPG like this) I found it a bit difficult to notice things I could pick up or interact with since they are so small. A few rare times I misclicked on something because of how small it is. I have an older system, so I wasn't able to play on the highest settings, I was able to however able to play on high even though the game suggested I play on low. So I can see pretty much everyone able to play this game with no issues. Even when I tried the highest settings I just had a slight drop in Frame rate.  Overall Divinity 2 I recommend highly, especially if you are a fan of old school RPGs and Pen 'n Paper RPGs, you will feel right at home playing this with a high level of immersion and ability to costumize your character however you desire. Story had been done before but it's presented well in the world, and should be interesting enough to keep you playing. Combat is deep, and will challenge the thinking sides of your brain to approach each encounter in most effective way possible, plus have you thinking best way to build your characters to deal with threats in your prefered way. You might find a little frustration in interacting with the world due to how small things are and will even miss a few things if you aren't careful, but it shouldn't be a big enough issue to remove any enjoyment in the game.   Hope you found this helpful if you took the time to read it."
Athravan,"1,782",80,4,January 8,Recommended,99.9,"Now that 2017 is but a memory I can say with confidence that Divinity: Original Sin 2 was my Game of the Year. Although I backed the game on Kickstarter (just like the first) and had an Early Access copy, I didn’t play it until full launch so that I could fully immerse myself. And immerse myself I did into this high-fantasy adventure that manages to make the magical and fantastical feel realistic and gritty. It has taken everything that was good about Divinity: Original Sin and improved upon it, whilst also making it so you don’t need to have played the first in any way as it takes place a thousand years before.  Whether I’m following a quest that portrays me as the savior of the universe (hero complex much?) or trying to solve the angst of a tiny rat I really believe in my characters and their responses. There is a balance between the epic and the banal, the frivolous and the fateful that creates a woven world that is wonderful to experience.  In my first playthrough, co-op with a friend, I’m a summoner, focusing on gathering my minions. I’m a bit heavy handed though, I’ll send my minions into battle at a moments notice from afar, but stand aside, watching the ebb and flow, supporting and commanding the field. I speak harsh truths and it frequently gets me into trouble even though I feel righteous. In my solo playthrough, I’m a morally ambiguous pickpocketing hitman with a deep, dark past that I’ve blocked from memory. I fight with my words, and flirt with absolutely everyone, often getting what I desire in alternative ways. Even though the majority of the quests are the same on multiple playthroughs (bar the character story quests which too, are dark and deep), it feels different. Different dialogue and varying methods result in genuinely diverse results and that’s testament to the freedom, flexibility and depth of the game.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 rewards exploration and creativity as many side quests can only be discovered or completed by turning over every rock, talking to every NPC or trying things that are a little out of the box. This may frustrate some but delighted me at every stage. There are no glowing quest signs and immersion breaking yellow exclamation marks here. If you don’t like reading, that’s fine – as everything is beautifully and uniquely voiceovered. But if you don’t like paying attention to detail, you’re going to miss out on a lot of the fun. This game is for people who like to genuinely invest their time and attention into the world they’re playing and the characters in it. Perhaps that, above all else is what reminds me of the D&D campaigns from my youth that I sorely miss.  Tactically the combat is as complicated as you make it, with different difficulty settings that cater to your preference for challenge. You can brute force things if you’re so inclined, but you’re rewarded for playing smart at any level and the game gives you the tools to feel like a tactical genius, with a deep satisfaction when you pull off a clever combo.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 has the old school charm of Baldur’s Gate and Planescape Torment but with modern mechanics and beautiful aesthetics, I finally feel like an RPG has surpassed them. It only took a few decades for us to get here. I wonder if this is the pinnacle of the genre and how long it’ll be before I can say that about a game again.   ♥♥♥ If you find the reviews of an old Welsh lady interesting, please follow  My Curator Page.

Just cause you know, he's like mysterious and all? And he's a really good looking cat, all the while being lectured by a crab? Oh, and trying to become a demigod and save the world, apparently  insane pathing possibilities (OH DEAR TP) Well rounded scenario, emo NPCs that drink blood or are possessed by demons like it's totally fine, and GOD the landscapes!!! I did spend a whole 10 minutes exploring a map and praising its beauty before remembering I had entered a fight. Hell, I just like clicking a spell and not actually launching it cause the casting animation is then suspended and they're F***ING MAGNIFICENT (not as much as my cat, tho. He's a nice cat.)

Entertaining, challenging, captivating, and of course it makes no sense sometimes cause you keep doing awesome tricks with your cat to try F**KING with the scenario. But you know what? It adapts to all the sh*t you do. It gets your sh*t together. It gets it all together, puts it in a backpack, all your sh*t, so it's all together. And then it makes wonders from out of nowhere and you're like ""but I was trying to act crazy! And I did! And still, cool sh*t keeps happening! It's a F***ING transsh*itation!!!

Many races, interesting locations, tons of secrets, tons of sidequests, billions of lines of conversations... It's not a perfect game, and surely has some tiny flaws, but the overall experience damn rocks. That love for all those details. Like at some point there is a Pianist-ghost (which you don't see usually without a skill) and beside her is a book of Kirill's (*sigh*) best songs. And you can ask her to play those. And she does. Spent like 15 minutes in that mansion just standing there and listen to Kirill's songs. That ""pet-pal""-Talent alone is worth a thumbs-up. It's so enjoyable talking to ""critters"" on a map. Getting hints, secrets or even quests. Or just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t nonsense :)   Pro-Hint (super tiny spoiler): Try to keep that cat alive at all costs you'll met very soon into the game ,-)  If you love RPG, like or can endure turn-based, there's no way around this one. GET IT. If you dislike RPG or turn-based: stay the heck away. This is not the droid you're looking for.   The good (what to love):  Play as one of the ""origin""-characters. With their own complete backstory. Which is highly recommended for your first playthrough. But you can still customize your character completly.  Graphics are really neat  SFX/Music is really great. Sadly no more new (obviously) tracks from Kirill. RIP man!  You can talk with animals. One of the coolest features ever in an RPG. Meet snobby cats, cynical crabs, hopelessly positive dogs, etc. Not only for fun, but also for quests, hints, secrets or for pure distracting amusement...Awesome feature!  MODS! The best thing a game could have. You don't like a particular feature? Get a mod. There is none? Make one. Every game should have that. PERIOD. This is and often was the distinct feature that seperated pretty good from AWESOME and long-lasting games.  Completely voiced, not one sentence is not spoken. I know, many people don't care, but it doesn't hurt either, does it? I personally like it for added immersion.  No bugs/crashed so far. After two complete playthroughs at the moment of this review. Not even a misaligned texture.  Often many ways to solve a problem. For example getting of the first island there are around 11 (right?) different ways to do that. Sure, most are pretty similar and end in more or less the same result, but as I often say: it's a game and not reality. Impossible to give you REAL freedom. It still feels like YOU chose the results.   Many actions DO have consequences. Some minor, some major.   Well done turn-based. From my noobish-PoV though. Fights are fun and can range from relaxing to OMFG-WHAT-HAVE-I-DONE.  Comparatively short loading-times. Once a map loaded, you instantly(!) switch areas (like to a cave or whatever else transition). VERY MUCH appreciated. Nothing kills immersion more than stupid 1-minute ""LOADING...""-screen. In and out of a cave in not a second. Yeah, great, thanks!  Tiny details like being able to make notes on the map. VERY helpful if you discover something that you MIGHT be able to solve/do/pickup/catch later.  You can specialize all of your companions upon you first meet them. Great detail! Like one of the characters but don't need their supposed role? Fine, change it. No problem.  End of Act 1, when you finally got a grip of things and how this crap works, you will get your option to RESPEC every character completely (including apprerance). YES! I love that. Some of us gamers don't want to put hundreds of hours into ONE game and multiple walkthroughs and be more efficient in JUST ONE walkthrough. Thanks for that. If you hate a feature like that, you don't HAVE to use it. The mediocre (not good, not bad, but no show-stopper either):  Some schools/talents/skills are somehow pointless and you will never use them. Good idea, bad execution  Some ambient chatter become VERY annoying VERY quickly when you're e.g. shopping near and micro-managing equipment. Damn stupid NPCs :-)  From time to time it doesn't really seem to matter much how you're playing (be the nice guy or the sociopathic arsewipe). Some or most encounters are bound to happen anyway either way. But well this is a game and not the real world, it's impossible to be prepared for everything :)  VERY high replayability (not a PRO for people with not much sparetime for gaming). Many ways to complete quests, enough people to form a party and hence change the quests/suprises/sidequests. This might be a big plus if you have much time at your hands.  If you hate micromanagement you might even be a lil frustrated at the lowest difficulty. You will have to manage gear, skills, talents and spells for four characters nearly every 5 meters when you've found a new thing. Lower difficulties are very forgiving though. But can still challenge you if you have zero idea of what's going on. But if everything's too much for you there are still MODS or even cheats.   No real Set-items. Well on the first Island there is a set. But not wearing the complete set curses you and by the time you'll have it complete it's of no use at all. And there isn't even a set-bonus. Reducing this to a boring errand for the completionist. The ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):  Items rarely really feel unique or great. Found a ""legendary""? Yeah well, walk 10meters and you'll find the next better one. Plus most non-""unique""-items are random which often results in horribly sucky items. Intelligence-requireing pants with +X strength. Strength-requirement-ring with +X Intelligence and some mage-stats. Yeah great. For selling. Boring. For example the first SET: Great to aquire. Requires lot of work/details. But you'll end up selling that stuff for some coins before even completing it to WEAR it. Meh, VERY unsatisfying.   SOMETIMES it can be hard to even spot your enemies in between turns due to all those status-effects on the screen. Could be worse, but could definately be better.  If you play on higher difficulties you might find some schools/classes/character-combinations pretty useless/unfair. That MIGHT kill it for you. But balancing a complex RPG like this perfectly is pretty much impossible to admit. No excuse? You're to judge...  Crafting sucks. No filtering, no sorting and you learn new recipes every few meters. But I failed to find the need to craft anything besides runes anyway. Recommended?  If you can wrap your head around turn-based and like RPGs? YESYESYESYESYES! Don't hesitate. Even if you don't much like top-down games. You'll quickly forget that (I usually prefer 1st-Person). This is one beautifully crafted gem, with love for details. I'd name it the Witcher-Series of turn-based-isometric-RPGs. And I'm a Witcher-Lover."

Johnny_Devo,150,86,4,"January 1, 2017",Recommended,236.1,"When I first got this game, I was immediately assaulted by an array of limiting areas, tough enemies, and hard fights, to the point where it felt like I wasn't allowed to do anything except a very strict railroad of easier enemies in order to progress. It made me start to lose faith in the game, because it seemed like there was only an illusion of freedom.  But then I got good. After floundering around in my first save file for a good few hours, I sat down and made a new character, applying everything I had learned. I made a focused character. I scrounged for every piece of armor, clawed at every possible avenue and advantage, and I applied the very tactics that destroyed me in the first playthough. It didn't take long to learn that if done right, the game is just as impossible for your enemies as it could be for you.  What I was rewarded with was knowing that there are, for example, several different ways to complete the first area. It's not a railroad; I just, to put it blunt, sucked. In fact, after discovering my first way though that beginning area... I went back in, and starting clearing out enemies, starting in order from most managable. It became an arms race of beating the lowest enemies I could find, surviving the encounter, and assimilating any loot I could find, up to and including the paintings on the walls.  Then, I come up to what I'll call ""midway"" through the first act. Suddenly things are falling into place with the plot, and I'm gaining hints of what appears to be a really neat story in the making. The varied things you can encounter kept my interest once I had the skill to progress, managing gear was interesting due to the magic armor and physical armor differences, and limited resources forced me to make interesting decisions every time I came across a nice piece of gear in a shop.  I began to learn of the various advantages and disadvantages inherent to different styles. Spreading your points can mean you have access to a ton of powerful toolbox abilities, but don't deal much damage. You can focus all your points into one aspect, and that character will be a high damage monster, but will lack in utility in comparison. Pair two such characters together, and your high damage will punch through the defenses of your victim, then the utility monster will knock them down for a turn, only to be put in the ground for good by your high damage character's second round.  Essentially, what I'm saying is if you find yourself overwhelmed by this game like I was at first, I suggest you attempt to absorb what the game is beating into you, then try to use that to beat it back into the game. If you can manage that, the varied builds and playstyles as well as the interactive battle system may just capture your attention.  Overall, this game is already something that I would consider great, and they're only in early access. They're still working on the game and the story, accepting feedback from the forums, and they're doing it well. Worth the full price now, can only get better from here. Would recommend."

This is the one game I don't regret buying at full price — and I'd gladly give Larian more as good and honest developer. I can tell that this title is a labour of love.

I have played this slice of the game to completion once and had several failed attempts which have put me at around 18 hours, I haven't even started pvp yet. There is going to be hours upon hours when this is completed. What's hours worth of content if it's not fun? It's really fun, I can't wait for more back stories, skills and character customisation but what's there right now is very entertaining.

jeep,161,48,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,75.4,"I am incredibly excited to say that this game is all that I could have asked of Larian Studios. As someone who loves Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, etc, Divinity: Original Sin 2 simply blows my mind. The dialogue can be witty, comedic, even tongue-in-cheek, but at times it is also grim, dark, and serious. Each character has their own way of coping with situations, and you as the player must work to keep the group together. You can choose the class of all of your adventurers, and tweak your main character at the start screen - in effect, you can multiclass from the get-go. Abilities synergize and can create opportunities that can be exploited by other party members - or, if you're not careful, by the enemy!   In terms of customization, the game is lovely. In summation, you can advance your character in a non-linear fashion if you so choose, but you might find it easier to create classes that are symbiotes (they benefit from each other's abilities).  In terms of audio, the game is FANTASTIC. The voice acting is wonderfully immersive, and the sound effects are well-timed and well-orchestrated. Speaking of orchestas, the soundtrack is incredible. If you don't believe me, give it a listen on YouTube. The ability to choose which instrument will play at turning points of the campaign really gives you that feeling of audio customization, and lets you feel like you are in control of every aspect of the game.  In short, I may sound like a ""yes-man"" when I wholeheartedly recommend this game. I may sound like there's nothing wrong with the game, but there are several bugs which are still unfixed and exploits that can be exposed to the savvy gamer. But, if you are like me, and you simply enjoy a game for what it has to offer (a complex storyline, diverse characters, entertaining combat, excellent audio, above-average graphics), then this game is for you!"

Yemeth,413,81,0,"December 15, 2017",Recommended,197.3,"You know those games that are just a few tweaks away of greatness? The original Original Sin was that kind of game.It had modernised CRPG mechanics,great combat,lots of choices on how to get on with the world,wonderful crafting yet cumbersome UI and a muddled story (even with the Enhancements later released)  Original Sin 2 tries to rectify all those mistakes. For my detailed review check this out:  http://indiannoob.in/divinity-original-sin-2-review-pc-noobreview-dungeons-dragons-and-mashed-potatoes/  +For starters, it has a more straightforward and darker storyline and writing. +The UI has been refined and is a lot more accessible +Character creation, customistaion, companions are all great. +General gameplay is still solid packing deep environmental interaction(in&out combat),fun crafting and exciting turn-based combat with good animations. +Classes are varied and many and balanced very well +Pretty much all lines are voice acted and they do a decent job.Same with the soundtrack +Challenging Tactician difficulty in which the game should be played (Normal being too easy) +Game Master mode for PnP RPG simulation and co-op is fun as always +Game looks great with a more grounded art style this time around +Mod Support   -I felt the streamlining of RPG attributes and skills from the first game is a bit of a let down (Although they allow less trial & error playthroughs) -The crafting seems to have been downplayed this time around.They have taken out the skills related to crafting and some fun recipes -Normal difficulty is way too easy,at least in the first chapter.  -Tactician mode felt cheap in some aspect like when it gives enemy ridiculous amount of physical and magical armor.In the first game,higher diffiiculty meant more enemies and smarter A.I.  TL:DR Orignal Sin 2 easily takes it's place as one of the greatest CRPGs ever along with Baldur's  Gate,Fallout,Wasteland,Planescape:Torment etc and at the same time possess mastery over it's technical aspects something the afforementioned games never did possess."
KRAUSER-SAMA,615,123,5,September 28,Recommended,74.7," The Short of it  Please note that everything that I write is based on my experiences with the Definitive Edition, and will also be looked at as standalone rather than compared to its predecessor.   Pros: +The world of Divinity OS 2 is vast and deep +The characters are fantastic, applies to NPCs but especially the Origin characters +An easy enough to understand combat system that possesses a great amount of depth +Absolutely stunning graphics +From the sound design to the soundtrack and especially the voice acting, it’s superb +The modding community is impressive to say the least with tons of ways to augment your experience  Cons: -...   More In-depth (Spoiler-Free)   +Story: Let’s start this off with one of DOS2’s greatest points, the story and world. While of course staying as spoiler free as possible, the game comes with an incredibly vast world for you to explore and venture through as you work towards your ultimate objective (which I’ll be withholding for any prospective players interested in the game). From the main quest to the side quests, from your perspective as the protagonist to the NPCs in the game’s world, Larian has truly given thought to how they’d flesh out every area in terms of it’s lore. The greatest part of all of this is that, despite being a sequel, there's no disconnect for the player even if you having played the first. While I recommend playing both, I can assure any of you who were hesitant about diving straight into the second, it's completely alright to do so. This point on just how deep the world of DOS2 goes becomes apparent the moment you attempt to create a character and are revealed the Origin characters which I will be focusing on next.   +Origin: What is an origin character? Origin characters are a set of 6 very unique characters that already have their backgrounds integrated into the very core of the game. You can think of them as the closest thing to a preset character when thinking in terms of RPGs, but you needn’t fret, they are completely customizable on their stat spread and what class you wish to play as. I especially love these origin characters because they add an entirely new layer to what’s going on, you’re not only worrying about the current state of the world as the story tells it, but also your own circumstances. For example (very minor spoiler ahead), one of the origin characters is a red lizard with the title of “The Red Prince”, born for glory yet fell from grace for “cavorting with demons”, and on his own quest to reclaim his rightful throne. Given his position in the overall world of the game, he’s an important figure to say the least, as a result very early on in the game an assassin will make an attempt on your life. That is just a very small insight as to what DOS2 has to offer. These origin characters could each have their own stories told separately, but no, they intertwine into a much bigger tale. The amount of content you get from the narrative of this game alone is astonishing, and for that Larian Studios deserves a round of applause.  +Gameplay: Now, let’s get to the real meat of the game, shall we? How does the game play? In a word, spectacular. The game, as a CRPG, gets the job down without many issues. From traversing the various lands to engaging in combat, the game both looks and feels great. As a keyboard and mouse user at the very least I found the controls to be quite intuitive. Combat is fairly simple, you learn skills and associate those skills to your hotkey of preference, activating said skill will either require that you choose a target or a specified location (Area of Effect) which will be controlled by your mouse. Pretty simple, right? However, the battlefield is ever changing and the higher the difficulty, the more considerate you need to be of what exactly is happening and how you should react accordingly. There are many factors that can go into a fight than just slinging spells into the face of your enemy, environmentals and utility based effects can be the key to turning the tide in a battle. This may sound like rather obvious advice, but I can’t think of a CRPG that’s done it better than how Larian Studios has.  Like in D&D (where you will often hear the comparison made), the game really starts from the beginning of the game, the character creation (yeah, we’re back to good ol’ character making) the distribution of your points from the beginning and how you proceed from thereafter is crucial, especially if you’re a player that wishes to challenge themselves with the highest difficulty. One particular stat in the game that I’d like to bring up in reference to this point is the “memory” stat. Memory is a stat that you upgrade when you wish to assign more skills to your hotbar. Learning the spell is one thing, but you can’t cast that which you haven’t “memorized”. As a summoner/caster hybrid of sorts I cannot tell you how much memory played a factor in how I progressed because there is such a wide variety of builds I wish to try. You can of course find a few mods to make this easier, but that’s completely player preference, I personally like the restriction otherwise I’d be a walking arsenal (which is fun in it’s own right hehe). The game is easy enough to understand but there are a number of factors that will make or break you in this game if you aren’t careful, be it in combat or otherwise.  +Graphics: Typically, a CRPG’s main concern isn’t how it looks, but DOS2 has been crafted with very special care in this regard. The environments are beautiful (in more than one sense depending on where you’re looking), the character models are fair and above all else magic possesses a special sort of impact I don’t see in other games of its genre. I’m particularly infatuated with the animations and poses performed when casting spells, the details on these animations alone are something to be in awe of.  +Sound: I must say, the sound design in this game is great given the variety of different types of skills there are to learn. In respect to the background music, in character creation, you can actually select an instrument of choice to play the soundtrack. This I found to be a very nice touch, as someone who likes his music. However, the aspect I’m truly stunned by is the voice acting. Just pure, high quality voice acting planted throughout the game for every NPC (including animals!). This is a standard I wish more games had already adopted, but we live in a world where many AAA titles still cheap out on giving certain lines any audible lines.  +Mods: The game provides a plethora of content on its own, but that’s not all the fun that’s to be had. Say hello to the world of mods if you’re playing DOS2. THe modding community for this game is incredible, there are many quality of life mods, class overhauls, or completely new classes altogether with specially made animations just for that class! Of course, that isn’t all there is to modding in this game, but I feel that those are the major ones to point out. Modding can truly enhance your experience, or extend the lifetime of this already eternal game by an unfathomable amount. If you feel bored playing a game once, even in a game with as much diversity as this, well mods will change that.    Conclusion  I could nag about the infinitesimally issues that rarely popped up here and there (like the particular position of the camera interfering with a particular action), but there’s just too much good content to talk about to even try. No matter what angle you try to look at this game from, it easily stands out from the rest and establishes itself at the top of its kind. A truly “divine” game.

Tuco,750,80,7,"November 25, 2017",Recommended,336.6,"Divinity: original Sin 2 is a strong contender to ""Game of the Year""  and with few meaningful tweaks it could easily compete to rank among the best RPGs of all time.  Like for its predecessor, its strong points are the massive amount of player agency permitted, one of the best turn-based combat systems in the business, a great degree of environmental interaction and very solid encounter design.  Disappointingly enough, this sequel fails mostly in the same area that hindered its predecessor: itemization and stat bloat. Larian's stubbornness with randomized loot over unique and hand-placed items means you'll never get rewards that are meaningful, just generic items that can drop anywhere or pop in any merchant's inventory at any given time. That kills a lot of incentives to bring down strong enemies, solve quests and explore for hidden treasures: when every action can potentially get the same outcome, it doesn't really feel like accomplishments matter that much.  On top of that, the problem with stat bloat emerges few hours into the game. While the problem presents itself from the beginning (by the time you'll get all the pieces of the first armor set in the starting area they'll be completely obsolete), it becomes genuinely grating past level 14-15, as you'll quickly get to the point where the jump in values at each level will be so ridiculous you'll literally double your HP/damage/armor values, etc. This essentially forces (well, strongly encourages) the players to replace ALL the equipment for his entire party at every level up.  That's not just annoying and a bit pace-breaking, but it also has the not irrelevant side effect to make you feel like no piece of equipment you'll find, no matter how strong at that given moment, gives you any long-term value.   There were surely better ways to handle these aspects, even just looking at the past. This game with the Baldur's Gate 2 itemization could have been a all-times classic."

Complete freedom in character appearance, abilities, personality, background, weaponry, even music. Compelling dialogue and choices with real and distinguishable effects. Multiple ways to progress through and finish major quests. This is how RPGs are supposed to work: total player agency.

Butcher Pete,231,37,7,"September 20, 2016",Recommended,159.7,"I played the first Divinity: Original Sin, and now I have played Divinity: Origin Sin 2 to completion (or to, at least, completion when it comes in terms of what is available in the alpha), and yet I am considering picking it up for a second run.  The combat of this game is excellent, and - I believe - is its shining feature.  And if you think you are particularly good at it there is now even a PvP arena in DOS 2.  With that said, if you did not like DOS 1, you will probably not like DOS 2.  The game is the same formula, practically the same combat system (with a few improvements and a few setbacks), and really the same story-quality of the first game.  You might find the story a little disappointing if you bought into all the hype that Larian threw down about hiring so many writers, when really what you are looking at is pages and pages of written dialogue (no voice acting) that you will probably begin to skip through six hours into the game.  And I say that as someone who loves books (Andrej Sapkowski's Blood of Elves is sitting right next to my keyboard).  But, look on the brightside: it's still early access right?  They could improve it... well, at least we can hope.  While I certainly have enjoyed DOS 2 for its combat, graphics, and character design... the story is not going to win any awards if it stays in its current form.  If that is going to be a deal breaker for you then I suggest you wait until the game is finished and see how it is then.  But if a badass combat system is enough to draw you in, then I'll see you in the arena!  (Oh, by the way, I should mention that the lizards in this game look really, REALLY badass... and sexy. :3)"

xXSparrow.KingsleyXx,158,162,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,69.4,"DOS II is a herald to old rpgs from the 80s-90s.  RPG’s like Fallout, Wasteland, Baldur’s Gate.  All of them rewarded you with exploration, dialogue, minute journal-keeping and little to no quest markers.  You relied on your wits alone to get you through the game.  Choices mattered in those games.  If you ♥♥♥♥ed up a quest, the game would make damn well sure you knew it – and felt it.  Unlike most modern RPGs, Divinity is open-ended and not just with classes.  You want to be a magic-wielding rogue?  Go for it.  Pure rogue that steals and kills everything that isn’t nailed down or moves?  Go for it.  The choice is yours!  Be whatever mixture of class/skills that you want.  What this game is is a love letter to rpgs of the past and it has little to no hand-holding.  Pros: + graphically one of the most beautiful CRPGS I've played.  Varied enviroments, painstaking details, vivid colors. + Written dialogue is very well done - characters have stories they're willing to tell + the story is intense; it leaves your morals confused and often conflicting + Incredible customization for characters.  Skills, weapons, attributes.  This really is a game that harks back to working your character out + Challenging.  This isn’t your momma’s half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥RPG.  This game WILL kick your♥♥♥♥♥if you don’t play your cards right + The world is massive and rewards players for exploring and roaming + Multiple solutions to quests.  There isn’t one way to do everything.  Find one solution you like?  Quest on!  Find another way that suits your fancy better?  Game on. + Graphically very pleasing to look at! + Music is what you’d expect from a fantasy game and it’s pleasing to chill out and relax to + Party members are interesting and have their own backstories/quests + Multiplayer/Co-op! + Option for fast travel when you discover waypoints + VO's are nice but I've played the game for so long without them that I find the experience more enjoyable with it off completely + loot in certain vendors has changed or does change so there's always plenty of variety + crafting is so optional that you almost don't really have to bother with it unless you want to + The Gamemaster mode is probably the best thing since tabletop simulator + The freedom to do what you want in-game + Loot once you hit just before leaving Fort Joy and after is beyond plentiful + Variety of characters, both recruitable and NPCs alike are astounding; everyone has a story worth listening to  Cons: - Gold can be hard to come by.  Or... you know, cheat - A lack of direction can often be confusing; especially for gamers just getting into the game/series +/- Multiple quest solutions can be missed or completely over-looked.  Although exploration/deep digging can help you find them  Final verdict: 9/10: would play love letter RPG again.  And again… and again."

"Sir Kirby, the Radio Pheasant",105,39,2,August 5,Recommended,187.2,"This game is as close to 10/10 as possible: There are plenty of encounters that play off each other, and impact that can be had from simple interactions you might not think much of. The amount of interplay from this game is absolutely amazing, and I'm almost certain you can have hundreds of hours and still miss some really small nuanced things in the game.  I came into this game never having played the first, and I still absolutely loved it. Single player is completely awesome, even if a bit more work, but if you have a group of friends to play this with? All the more awesome.  The following review is spoken without ever touching modding, or anything beyond the base campaign.  Some complaints that you should be on the lookout for: -Grasping the spell interactions can be a bit steep when starting out for mages. (For instance, you may poison your undead tank to heal them, and then hit them with a spell called Fortify which can remove your heal) -Sometimes, you can be roped into conversation with a character who isn't your pursuasion char, and then be forced to spill spaghetti and rope your team into a fight -Line of sight will 9 times out of 10 kill you, and you can only cry a single tear as the NPC sometimes snipes you through solid walls -Spell mileage will vary greatly from the player to the computer (a charmed/taunted npc may cheese out their turn, where you will seemingly always be forced to do something absolutely silly and try to kill yourself) -Whenever your characters are charmed/taunted, they *will* absolutely destroy your inventory full of consumables (though they will *always* use your rain scrolls first) -In later levels, with lots of particle effects and interactions, the computer may take quite a bit of time in deciding their turns -Sometimes, depending on how good your computer is, you can have a very unstable game -Some playstyles aren't quite viable. (For instance, a battle mage is ""possible"", but not really ideal, as you end up splitting damage over physical/magical resistance, which makes Crowd Control nigh impossible, as the real damage from physical/magical spells comes out when you are hitting their Hit Points directly) -Spirit vision (a thing that lets you talk with ghosts) is great from a lore perspective, but it can be easy to forget how versatile it is if you're not actively thinking about it; and if you're actively thinking about it, you pretty much have to spam it and walk across the world hoping you don't miss a fun little lore tid-bit. -Some fights are just straight up brutal if you don't quite know what's going on, all I can say is don't be afraid to google a bit of help if you're really struggling  Despite the complaints above, those really are just minor inconvinences which you'll have from time to time. Think of them like speedbumps in the middle of a really awesome racetrack. Like, you can't deny the rest of the racetrack how awesome it is, though you sometimes wish you could run it without the speedbumps. (Fingers crossed that some grievances will be removed in the Enhanced Edition) Pros: -After the initial learning curve, you basically get to sit back and relax and explore an amazingly intricate world of well written, well voiced, beautifully animated and beautifully built NPCs and the world they live in. -You get a lot of self-insertion capability, either playing the righteous hero, or scourge of the land.    And now for a fun story with minor spoilers:  So I'm playing Beast On the last legs of his life being beaten up unfairly by 3 condecending copies of Amadia, and 1 of Duna he's shackled he's maimed he's crippled he's floored he's on fire he's an inch from death our team long since abandoned him save for one lovely summoner Fane and his Incarnate ""Waga"" Champion in a true heroic moment tried to send a charge of battering ram to knock them all down but no one got to see what happened after the champion charged all 4 members of our divinty crashed as soon as the spell was cast 11/10, would get rekt again  "

Narayan,698,32,4,February 8,Recommended,172.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a true modern cRPG. Instead of just emulating the Infinity Engine itself, it preserves the old school soul and complexity, includes all the things you would expect from ye olden days, adds many positive surprises on top of it, then frames them into amazing shiny 3D visuals with functional UI and tons of convenience. Even though there is number 2 in the title, it can be played as a standalone game without prior knowledge of the previous OS, or others in the Divinity series.  The game world is just packed with stuff to do - every few steps you bump into something new happening. And that’s above and below ground, as the game features quite a lot of caves, dungeons, ancient ruins, cellars, and even a pocket universe. The player has always plenty options to chose from how to proceed. Abilities like persuasion or lockpicking are really useful, and talking to animals is just awesome. The story is serious in tone, with many mature subplots, but it’s not lacking some needed moment to moment humor either (usually when doing side missions, not as unnecessary comic relief to main line). There are many memorable characters & situations. The companions are great and well fleshed out, each of them quite distinct. Their stories often intertwine with the main plot, so they all feel relevant.  While the game is fantasy in nature, and there are plenty of things we’re used to, there are also many quirks and ideas unique only to this world. Enough for it to feel fresh most of the time.  It’s not perfect though (but close). There are limits to what you can do, although there is very high chance you'll be able to execute most plans you come up with. The pacing was a little weird as well - the 2nd area with Driftwood was just too huge and not particularly structured. They might have been aiming at more open feel after the initial island, but it just turned out to be tiring by the end of it, and I couldn’t wait to get out of there. I’m aware that if I wasn’t a person hell bent on scouring every inch of the map, and doing absolutely everything, I might feel otherwise, but that’s just the way I like to play, so that part didn’t mesh well with my game style. I had to take a break a bit after that, but later areas, Nameless Isle and Arx were great again :)   Part of that issue might have been due to combat, there was just too much of it for my taste. The combat at first is quite confusing, since many useful skills are too spread out between different lines, and it introduces some new concepts like surfaces. Then you get the hang of it, and it’s fun for some time, and later on you get overwhelmed by sheer amount if it. There are many epic fights all right, but at the same time, even though I appreciated the variety and scope of them, sometimes I just wanted to get it over with and progress a bit faster (turn based battles can take a while).  But overall D:OS2 is simply outstanding. Highly recommended :)  Written after 173 hours played & 84 of 97 (87%) achievements earned. "
Grant,376,69,3,September 3,Recommended,114.0,"I will try to keep this review short and sweet.  Generally speaking - I am not a fan of turn based games. I prefer real time RPG Combat found in games like Skryim, Fallout, and Witcher 3 (The GOAT).   With that being said, even with it not being my favorite combat method, this game is INCREDIBLE. The story and choice making you can make is very similar to Fallout : New Vegas, where each dialogue matters and has an impact.   In terms of replayability, you can choose across multiple ""Origin"" characters, who all have deep back stories and the ability for you to influence the future on a very large scheme.   If you like RPGs where you get to make choices, this ranks up in the top 3 for me, which are Fallout : New Vegas, Witcher 3, and Divinity : Original Sin 2.   If you've taken the time to read this entire review, take the plunge and invest the time in this game, because it is insanely good."
Separomaturi,219,56,3,"December 26, 2016",Recommended,78.4,"After spending hundreds of hours playing D:OS, I can confidently say that D:OS 2 improves nearly every aspect of the original's gameplay.  Without spoiling any of the story so far, I can at least comment on the richness of the added mechanics, and the undeniable feel of polish added to the user interface, character creation, and combat.

Sarlic,336,43,0,"September 18, 2016",Recommended,152.5,"EDIT:  Below this edit is the original review I made during Early Access. Currently I would have to say 100% of my issues with the game in the early access were addressed even before the release. The AI has been improved to the point they make choices a skilled player may make. The Mass AP issue has been entirely resolved. The issue with certain skills not being balanced as in Hailstorm, Single Dagger and others have all been rebalanced and made entirely fair.   To add to this they have outdone themselves by adding FULL voice acting in the game, something that was only in the first one after the enhanced edition. The mechanics for the undead are entirely fleshed out. The storyline is entirely fluid and fleshed out. I can honestly say this game has not only met but exceeded my every expectation is entirely justified in its price for the quality put into it. Larion Studios has released a game that shows what EARLY ACCESS should be used for and it's benefits. I whole heartedly look forward to their next game.  EARLY ACCESS ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'll start by saying that I am well aware it's early access so some features are clearly not available as of yet.  The game is indeed an improvement overall to the first game, the combat is more fluid and challenging however I do see an issue in the fact the AI seemingly has collosal amounts of AP and can walk halfway across the field and still attack. This was an issue in the first game as well though and not a fault in D:OS2.  Even the very first goal of chapter one can be suceeded in so many ways including simple brute force if you happen to be a tactical genius. The added Highground vs Lowground bonus/penalty for ranged attacks in a great addition as it adds other dimension to the tactics in combat.   My greatest complaint is really just a matter of not being able to test out the true customization of the character classes. I also admit that the first town in D:OS seemed to have so much more to do but I do enjoy the more serious and adult approach of D:OS2.  All in all I genuinely believe the game is worth picking up, not necessarily saying people should buy it now at full price but it will definitely be a game worth playing with your friends. Albeit a very unforgiving game."
Sgt. Steak,122,79,5,June 11,Recommended,147.7,"ForenoteI apologize if this review doesn't appear as crisp as others on this page, as I don't write them often. That said, I feel this is one that absolutely warrants doing so. I'll attempt to spare you copious amounts of gushing in favor of clearer, more concise points as I go, though you should be aware that I've always had a weakness for games like this. Your mileage, as it will in all things, may vary.   Positives Craftsmanship: Excellent! Clear attention to detail and passion funneled into worldbuilding. There is a lot to see, hear and learn in Rivellon, and you'd be amazed at where and from whom this knowledge comes from.   Character depth: Glaringly flawed in some areas, but otherwise great! Whether pre-built avatars or enlisted as companions in the game itself, the game's cast of characters is unique and brimming with their own motives, thoughts and ideas. Likewise, those you do take with you aren't just along for the ride, and will actively attempt to make an impact on your adventure.  Nuance and Build Variety: Excellent! Anything is possible (within some very loose limitations) provided you're willing to work to put it together.  Gameplay: Good! Turn-based strategy type combat similar in nature to XCOM, with some departures in the form of such things as character-specific initiative. Larian's systems have a few issues, though, and a fair number of them can be really, really frustrating to deal with.  Story: Great! Not the most amazing story I've experienced, but definitely worth the time. It doesn't pull punches, and if nothing else, it is profoundly immersive.  Graphics: Excellent! Far above and beyond what is often expected of this genre, and despite the abundance of particle effects and bodies on screen, it runs smoothly to boot.  Soundtrack: Fair! Nothing to write home about, sadly. It can absolutely set up a mood, but it never struck me as anything I'd carry with me beyond the game itself. Negatives Equality of Companion Storytelling: Not every character was written equal, and it shows. Some have little to no impact on the story overall, while others quite literally change the perspective of everything going on. Taking those that land in the former category invariably trades interesting character dialogue, interations and bonding for what has the potential to be some of the more interesting tid-bits about the lore, important figures and what-not.  Gameplay: Inconsistent autosave mechanic makes it easy to lose hours of progress if you're not particular about saving over and over again. Items acquired during that lost time are not guaranteed to exist upon a reload, nor will they have the same stats as the game rerolls everything you do not presently own each time you reload. Initiative can be annoying and it creates opportunities for more powerful enemies to murder a member or members of your party before you can even act, if you aren't careful.  'Endgame': I feel no shame in admitting Divinity's stronger moments are in its first half, where you're getting to know the world and the people you're traveling with. A lot of crazy, fantastical things happen, but it all serves to further motivate you to seek out the real and honest truth. Sadly, however, a lot of the payoff isn't quite as stellar as I was hoping it'd be. In an effort to keep from spoiling anything, I'll clip this bullet with: Some of the final decisions can feel a little forced, and as resolutions approach, it becomes painfully obvious that, as above, not all companions and characters were written equal. Overall Divinity, in spite of what are ostensibly minor flaws (with the exception of some of the story-related notes), is a game that I wholeheartedly reccomend if you're a fan of the top-down dungeon crawler/RPG style of game. It has a lot of heart, and the world is very well put together. While there are some inconsistencies, some painfully overt 'nyah nyah' moments with the game's villains, and a general undertone of slight predictability to its story, it pulled me in and got me hooked on all the little details it had to offer. My only major gripe from a roleplaying standpoint is how... well, for lack of a better word, weak some of the resolutions are. At best, it can feel a little forced and at worst, some of the endings to several of the arcs in my playthroughs struck me as outright betrayals of everything that had been built up. In an effort to avoid spoilers (beyond what little I already have), this is something best experienced and decided in person.   As for gameplay, Divinity offers a rather open-ended system that can be tweaked and paired in a vast number of ways. It helps keep combat engaging, and it offers a great deal of replayability, as there are always new ways to try tackling different situations. That said, it has some very serious flaws that I found somewhat stifling, not the least of which being encounters with tougher enemies with a party that wasn't solidly invested in high initiative scores. Others, such as strange inconsistencies with line of sight, action points and other integral mechanics were certainly noticeable, but hardly game-breaking. Not much of a change from the first game there, I'm afraid.  In all, I'd rate this a 4/5. I would have been comfortable paying more than its asking price for the experience I got."

Dank Knight,397,89,5,February 2,Recommended,184.4,"NOTE:This is my experience after 45 hours into the game on Tactician difficulty, mostly solo. So the review is subject to changes.  PROS: (Oh boi, where do I begin from) +Looks very good visually and boasts equally good music. +Deep character customisation and progression. +Complex, intricate systems that let you experiment and even break the game. This lends to a lot of player freedom and agency. +Staggering attention to detail. +Quests are plenty and missable. There are multiple approaches and outcomes to every quest. +Chaotic, tactical combat along with clever AI scripting +The amount of replayability is off the charts! This is one game which requires multiple runs to experience everything.  CONS:-Some UI issues, where I had to click on a combat skill multiple times for the game to register it. A minor nitpick.  VERDICT:Simply put, Divinity Original Sin 2 IS the best role-playing game that makes The Witcher 3 look like a generic open-world title. What you get is an impossibly interactive game world where every action seems possible, and has consequences with such a level of complexity and flexibility it’s difficult to believe it exists, let alone that it could ever be bettered.  Its scope can be intimidating, but not overwhelming, and there’s usually a way to fix a mistake.  And it’s that intimidating, ambitious scope, that dedication to player freedom, that makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so impressive.  There isn’t another game right now that lets you do so much.   This is an easy 10/10. Buy it, play it and fall in love with RPG's all over again."

There are a few bugs here and there, but that is to be expected with a game in its Alpha stage. I love this game and I even purchased it for two of my friends, which they are addicted to now! I would highly reccomend this game to all RPG fans, and to any gamers for that matter.   Pros: Fantastic Music Great Strategic gameplay Graphics are clean For being only Act 1, story is well fleshed out Great teamplay and multiplayer experience Great opportunity for role-playing  Steep gameplay consequences (seriously)  Cons: Occasional game breaking bugs (Save often!) Memory System needs to be over-hauled! Gear being Attribute locked (Can be frustrating at times)  "
Darxim,122,34,2,"November 16, 2016",Recommended,498.8,"[Updating review from Early Access]  Almost all of the negative reviews of this game remark that they gave negative review for one of two reasons: 1. Game has too many bugs. 2. Game is too difficult.  That first one is fair.  There are a lot of bugs.  I'm currently not actively playing it due to this.  With this game's ambitious scope, bugs are expected.  Although, relative to a Bethesda game, this game was practically bug-free at release.  The second point, however, is just stupid.  tl;dr: It's not.  When you start the game, you choose your difficulty.  If Tactician is too hard for you, play Classic.  If Classic is too hard for you, play Explorer.  If Explorer is too hard for you, I'm surprised you're able to operate a computer at all.  I started one game on Explorer just to find something out that I couldn't where I was in my game (it was crafting related), and I was killing most things in one hit.  How is this difficult for you?  Honestly, I think it's just people playing on Tactitican because they think they're awesome, then get their asses handed to them because they're not.  I've seen people claim that Act 1 is impossible on Tactician.  Keep in mind that people had already beaten the entire game on Tactician when these claims were made.  If you want an easy game, I would say that this game is not for you, but Explorer mode is available, and it is a really good game, so you should probably still play it.  Another complaint I've seen, although it's rare, is about the level bloat.  I agree with this complaint.  There is way too big a difference between one level and the next, and the steepness of the curve makes it a lot worse.  The game would be a lot better without it.  I can understand the power increase from leveling being on a curve, as that's normal, but the curve is too damn high."

Harkening back to the golden era of Fallout, Planescape: Torment, Baldur's Gate and the likes, it fully deserves to stand alongside those greats.   It's hard to explain how enjoyable the game is. It refines and improves almost everything from the original Divinity: Original Sin. The attention to detail, environments, quests, voice acting, combat, etc are all fantastic. The addition of multiplayer is absurdly fun and just the sheer variety the game offers is something else entirely. It's such a smooth RPG experience but so polished, and still retains the things that made old school CRPGs so great. Everything comes together to make this atmospheric experience, from the music to the writing and to the mechanics themselves.

Initially the lack of voice acting was my only bane and still kind of is, but I can understand why with the amount of writers in this game as opposed to the first. Only 2 writers for Divinity Original Sin, there's triple that for this and voicing the game would take years. Conversations feel a lot more in depth too and I found myself voluntarily reading it as opposed to just skipping, which is what I ended up doing on Original Sin (not that it was boring, I loved the voice acting, just got very tedious in my opinion).

federated state of trollnesia,158,80,5,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,51.7,"Some pretty severe balancing problems really hurt this game on the harder difficulties at the moment I write this review. It definitely seems like melee-heavy parties are not very viable. I've restarted three times now and reduced my party's melee investment with each restart and I've been progressively enjoying the combat more as a result. Basically, melee at least so far in the first act, do not have mobility skills they need to do anything. Attacks of opportunity require a trait investment, which is kind of lame. It doesn't help armored enemies mitigate a lot of melee damage and that getting magic resistance as a fighter is difficult, resulting in a lot of annoying CC from numerous enemies.  I've had to cheese a lot of my fights to win them (abusing conversation mechanics mostly) and it feels kind of bad.  The game is still fun, but I would advise doing research about party composition before investing a lot of XP.  Also, this game commits a lot of ""cardinal sins"" for me: 1. Persuading people down from fights...results in a net XP loss and no notable change in the story's outcome (at least so far); as far as I can tell, being a murderous bastard is the best way to play this (by far, even). Aside from meager barter prices I don't see a point in making a charismatic character. 2. You're encouarged to fight and kill trash for XP; at multiple parts in the first act instead of advancing the story like I wanted to, I was compelled to scour the area for more things to kill. If you like this, then this is the game for you. Reminds me a lot of Baldur's Gate in that regard. 3. Some party members, if you don't keep them on a short leash, will break quests for you by doing naughty things to NPCs. 4. Quests break...and there's no notification about it. It's basically a missing thread. It's kind of interesting this way, leaving you to figure out how to resolve the quest, but if there's no way to resolve it, you'll never know for sure. So be careful when you go murdering people who might be connected with a quest. This is definitely preferable over Skyrim's ""everyone is invulnerable"" bullcrap, but I'd like to know when I've royally ruined everything and should reload. 5. A lot of game mechanics aren't forshadowed at all (one of the early fights has turtles which...explode for a ton of damage when you kill them, really great surprise when you have a lot of melee in your party) and you'll be reloading after you experience them. 6. Numerous boss weapon drops so far for me have been inferior to standard stuff I find in shops. It's funny (not in a way I like), this one notable enemy I killed dropped a dagger which had a ""10% bleed chance"" mod on it - and that was supposed to be the draw for me using it I guess? In a turn based strategy game, ""10% anything"" might as well as not be there. There are a lot of other lukewarm mods on gear that might as well not be there or do anything. I've been vendoring a lot of stuff. 7. Gold isn't super abundant, so you will be picking up pots, pans, and kitchen sinks to make by. I've never liked this as it's just absolutely silly and tedious.   Depsite my gripes, this is definitely a solid RPG and tactics game, at least the most of what we can expect from 2017."

The only thing I wish was that they had made it easier to know what items combined to do what.  I felt like I was missing out on how the crafting system worked. Also I'm not sure on this Source pt system.  Granted you do not get much access to it till the end of Act 1 but I'm hoping this won't be something that is finite in the game.  I like to use the high level moves in combat more often,"
Prime,180,26,0,"October 20, 2017",Recommended,119.1,"This game made me excited to play games again. I love it, 10/10. Okay, maybe not. Assigning a number score is ♥♥♥♥ing useless anyway. I will just be critical of this game and probably talk more about the things I dislike as opposed to the things I do, everyone has already gushed enough about this game. I think it is one the best RPGs of this generation, but it's not perfect.  Extremely open ended, with lots of possible ways to approach a given objective (encounter/quest etc.) which opens up a lot of possible playstyles/roleplay choices. This however, does introduce a lot of broken sh*t, the quest log being one glaring example and I have broken a few enounters by doing X when I should have done Y first  for some arcane reason .  Characters are well written, although all the fantasy cliches are there, they are subversive to those tropes in places and each main character has a nicely rounded theme/character arc. Writing in general is nuanced and mature, serious in tone but not lacking in humour a la classic Larian. Main Quest has some interesting ideas and dynamics, but kinda falls apart by the end of act 3 imo  (Act 3 feels very endgame, only for the main villian to pull out a dues ex machina 'lolz gotcha!', only played up to the begining of act 4, so who knows, might redeem itself in the end)    Combat is a little different from Original Sin 1 because of the inclusion of the Armour system. It prevents turn 1 CC deciding battles, and I think it makes you think a bit more tactically during the initial turns but overall I think the system needs some improvements as your mindset going into each battle remains mainly the same, and it also makes some builds pretty trash (tanks, phys/ele hybrids etc). I like saving throws in D&D, a hybrid system where, for example, armour values influenced saving throws would work better imo.  I am not a fan of the character development, way too much number creep (going to the next levels means each piece of gear is instantly outclassed), gear isn't really that intersting, just get some +stats and maybe a free non-unique skill. Vitality/armour/damage scale way too high and picking stats comes down picking whatever gives you the damage multipliers for your skills. Not really engaging or meaningful. Thankfully these points can be easily solved by using mods, but mods don't influence my opinion on the design philosophy of the base game.  Tactician mode is kinda busted, maybe I need to git gud, maybe my fun Nice BuildsTM do not abuse mechanics enough. Classic mode gets too easy, too quickly. Woe is me.  Mods pls fix   Overall though, this is on par with some of the best in the genre, and Larian should be commended for their ethical kickstarter/development process. The director has alluded to extra content in the future and has admitted to some flaws so thumbs up again."

rick.activemd,166,51,2,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,174.3,"So I feel I have enough information to give a well-informed review now that I'm 36.2 hours in. I've been reading, however, that if you haven't left the island yet, you are still in the tutorial! Immediate kudos for a content-packed game.  Having played the original Divinity tile from 2002, I've seen this game develop from a Diablo-esque point-and-click action RPG to the turn-based strategy game that is now Divine Divinity: Original Sin 2. Although I've missed a game or two since then, I wasn't quite sure what the storyline was, but the game clearly helps you understand what's been going on in the world of Rivellon right from the start. The immediate immersion into the game has the amazing quality to have me asking questions and wanting to seek out the answers to those questions. I was compelled to keep playing as I see the story unfold and each decision leads to more tangled pieces of the web of mystery that I need to solve.  The combat was easy to figure out immediately and I have to give Larian Studios another amazing pat on the back for integrating Full Controller Support for a turn-based isometric RPG. One of my big turn-offs is that, although I've played for keyboard and mouse combo for many years, I like my gamepad much better and will not buy any titles that don't support it.  There's some dispute about the Tactician mode and whether or not it's too hard. Having played 8 hours in Tactician mode, I finally discovered that if I wanted to enjoy the game and be able to progress in it, that I would have to play in Classic mode. Even in Classic Mode, the fights are still difficult and I've had to play a few of those, get killed multiple times, go level up my characters and improve my gear, and then finally win. Sometimes winning just barely with half my party killed.  The character creation was a little strange from most RPGs I've played, since you aren't really locked into a particular class and you can be whatever you want, based on the allocation of your Talents and Skills. I chose to play as origin character Ifan ben-Mezd, since I wanted to find out more about the storyline and how people fit into it. The build-selection during character creation made it easy to figure out what Skills and Talents were appropriate for the style of play you wanted for your main character. I always choose a good combination of melee and magic, so Battlemage was perfect for me.  Character dialogues have an added flair to them that give you extra choices based on certain tags you have or aquire or choices specific to certain origin characters.  The voiceovers are amazing and abundant, even down to having your own personal narrator. Many RPGs don't put that level of artisitic detail into their games when it comes to audio choices.  The environment is beautifully rendered and I enjoy it in full 4K resolution on my 65in. television. Full camera control with zoom in and out makes the environment easy to navigate.  Overall notes about Divinity: Original Sin 2:  * Content-packed (packed like it could rival the amount of content in Skyrim) * Mysterious and interesting storyline that makes you want to keep playing * Combat system is easy to figure out, but beware of Tactician Mode (was too hard for me) * Full Gamepad Support in a turn-based RPG (a rare find...I would play Tyranny if it had  Gamepad support) * Detailed voiceovers and soothing soundtrack * Great-looking environment that scales well to 4K resolutions  I hope this review helps someone!"

Tamaster,561,40,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,234.5," Review - Divinity: Original Sin 2  ===   RATING: 9.5 / 10 Legendary. There is no other word for it.   Overview Divinity Original Sin 2 (from now DOS2) is the second installment of the Original Sin saga, developed by Larian Studios first time a couple years ago. Veteran RPG makers as they are, they come a long way since they made the first Divine Divinity back in the early 2000's, and also the following chapters which all were good games (No, Beyond Divinity never existed, shhh). DOS2 is a real time RPG with turn based combat, with some new twists in the classic mechanics to keep it modern.  ===   Gameplay Analysis   General Gameplay  There is so much to say about the gameplay of DOS2, there really is. First of all, the thing that astonished me the most among all the good ones, which are really a lot, is the incredible freedom given to the player in all his actions and interactions with NPCs and eventual co-op players alike. The freedom DOS2 offers is as close as it can get to pen-and-paper RPG level of freedom transported in a videogame: every NPC is killable, everything can be stolen, companions will react on what you do based on their alignement and may even become your enemies (and so can do players you fplay with in multiplayer!), there are a myriad of different dialogue options suitable for any alignment you might want to role-play about, unique dialogues for each of the story NPCs, unique race-based ones, unique background-based ones, reputation based ones... so i mean, there are so many unique combinations and things that can happen that every play-through will be very different as far as interactions go, it's all about what you do and who you are, in this Larian did a wonderful job and very few other RPGs ever have been at the same level of depth in interactions.  Other than this, gameplay is pretty much straightforward and like any other classic RPG: explore a very vast world composed of 3 huge areas, plus all the dungeons and secret places of course, loot from randomly generated pieces of gear (except unique ones, those are always the same), fight a good variety of enemies each with its own features, and mind you enemies are very different from one another in this game so you will have to use new strategies a lot, solve quests in various ways depending on your alignment of just on how you feel like doing, but remember everything has some consequences.  If i was to explain in detail all the gameplay, this would be a very very long review and would go over the Steam word limit, so i tell you this: there have maybe been 2-3 RPGs in the whole history that match the depth this one offers, don't miss it.    Combat System  Combat in DOS2 is turn based and very much classic style. Every character starts with a fixed AP number each turn (excluding buffs and debuffs of course) and they are used for both movement and actions. There is no Mana in Divinity OS2, just cooldowns for all skills, and for some, a special type of energy is required.  The new mechanics Larian decided to introduce in OS2 are mainly about how armor works: in DOS2 there are two types of armor, Magical and Physical, which act like additional health bars and nullify any debuff or damage from that specific source (magical armor counters magical damage and magical debuffs, and so on) as long as it has 1 point at least. Once an Armor is depleted it can be regenerated with some skills and potions, but while down, Debuffs and negative statuses will always afflict the targeted character, there is no such thing as success percentage, it just matters if you have still Armor or not. The elimination of RNG this way is a quite clever gameplay change, but also comes with some issues we will discuss further on.  Other than that, rest assured, there are plenty of skills and fighting schools for all tastes, from warriors to healers to summoners, there are something like 150+ skills around to build your very custom characters the way you want.    Content  Immense. There is no way you can do everything in one play-through, you will have (and want to) play this game multiple times to get all the interactions, quests, and so on. To make just one play it can very well require above 85 hours, to complete the game 100%, can require more than 200.     Balancing  There just is one but quite serious issue with balancing: based on how the Armor mechanic is structured, it is logical to think that a party basing all its damage on either Physical or Magical would defeat enemies much quicker than splitting damage between example, 2 magical and 2 physical characters. And it is exactly how it is: a party based on just 1 type of damage is much more efficient, maybe too much, in combat and can defeat most enemies with much more ease than a ""standard"" party with some magical and some physical damage.    Challenge  Tactician difficulty, the hardest, is a serious challenge if taken without the proper respect. Badly built parties will be wiped with ease and requires planning, strategy in combat and experience. Some fights really impressed and got me on the brink of madness, let me tell you, and i play RPGs since twenty years! Luckily the unlimited and free re-spec at your base and adjustable difficulty will make the game beatable even for the less experienced.  ===   Technical Analysis   Graphics  Environments and art of cutscenes are really well done. Bear in mind this game does not make graphics one of its priorities, still the visuals are quite stunning in certain environments, particle effects are well done, character models are alright, armor and weapon models are made with particular care.  The world on DOS2 is vibrant and alive, the ccharacterization of the various environments and locations is marked very distinctively, it all contributes to the immersion feeling you already get from the roleplaying part.    Sound  It is to mention that Larian decided to voice act EVERY SINGLE DIALOGUE of this game, and there are a monstrous quantity. The voice acting is also good. This alone is a huge plus. other than this, the music and sound effects are at very good standards for an RPG, no really, they are good.    Performance  Performance is alright, the game is optimized well enough but can become heavy for low to mid end machines because it renders and makes all the characters in a whole area work together at the same time so it requires some computing power some machines might not have to run everything smooth.  Also when saving the game has some inexplicably huge frame drops.    Stability  DOS2 is not really unstable, it crashes sometimes, it is bound to happen, but rarely. There are no particular stability problems.    AI  Enemy AI is one of the best i've ever seen around. They will execute complex maneuvers to get the most efficiency out of just about everything. Think of this: enemies will get shoulder attacked to walls to avoid being back-stabbed if they are supports or ranged units and there is a rogue in the enemy team. How often you see this? Never. This is the level of AI i'm talking about, the same AI that curses you with healing is damage to bypass your shield and kill you with your own healing the next turn.  Prepare to be impressed.    Quality of Life  Inventory management and interfaces are generally good, but one thing is really bad: picked up new items will constantly clutter your hotbar and having to always clean it is a chore... there is a mod that solves this (blessed modding!) but as far as the vanilla game goes this is an issue.    Bugs / Issues  Sometimes enemies will just get stuck in combat if the pathfinding becomes too complex or if they are teleported / thrown / whatever in locations they cannot walk down from. In Act 3 some voice lines and dialogues are broken and do not work properly."

Shit Stain,441,19,0,"January 25, 2017",Recommended,83.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 improves on almost everything gameplay wise from the first game.  No longer do you have to deal with unfair elemental damage and debuffs that one-shot you, instead there's a new armour system that blocks this kind of damage more reliably, both physical and magical. This new system makes it so you manipulate the battlefield to your advantage more so than just spamming out CC spells on the enemies.  Combat is a lot smoother as they are both extremely aggressive but at the same time tactical as you aim your attacks. With the new armour system you will rely more on throwables and the environment to lower the opponents armour so that you can start controlling them with stuns or burning them.  A new addition are dialogue checks which are similar to the checks present in old isometric Fallout games where your statistics determine your ability to have a successful persuasion chance. Be careful who you use to talk to certain NPCs as now the checks are decided by your main stats and not only your persuasion stat.  Now the game is out of early access I really have to commend Larian for creating a fantastic game. They changed a few of the early fights so that they aren't too broken but at the same time switching it up enough to still make it challengeing. The new additions of polymorph skills and generous placement of source as well as tons of crafting recipes really shows Larian's commitment to making an amazing game.  Never before have I marveled at the magnificence and brilliance of an RPG as much as Divinity: Original Sin 2.  The freedom, progression, story and overall game mechanics makes this one of the best games I've ever played."

This game may seem overwhelming at first but that's what makes it sooo much fun in my opinion. Its what brings replayablitiy to the game. The glorious and satisfying combat just makes you want to keep coming back for more. There's nothing like freezing a puddle and then have Ifan trip over it. GODWOKEN DAMNIT IFAN!  The story is pretty awesome too!!! You really feel for the characters and are really invested in their adventures.  I love this game and would definitely recommend it. It's brought me faith for the single player turn-based combat rpg genre. :D"

Divinity Original Sin 2 offers a campaign with memorable characters, interesting role-playing options, and excellent systemic combat. The environments are beautiful and the soundtrack is solid. Gameplay mechanics and player freedom create a world I could see myself revisiting with different parties just to watch the story unfold differently. It may not be for everyone but if you’re willing to invest the time this title is one that will be played over and over for years to come.

DirtyBrownTaco,474,28,2,March 13,Recommended,71.0," Divinity: Original Sin 2 has been an utter delight from start to finish.  I use no hyperbole when I say this is the best RPG I've played thus far.   Pros   Fantastic score. Whether it be running around Fort Joy, taking in the sights on the Lady Vengeance, or amid an intense battle, the music sticks with you all the way through. I've been listening to some tracks repeatedly since first hearing them.   One of the deepest RPGs in terms of choice. A task such as escaping an island ends up having a plethora of options for you to achieve your goal. Want to sneak through a secret dungeon guarded by fire slugs? Sure why not. Want to get out simply by taking a boat? Go for it! Oh what's that? You want to cheat the system and simply teleport yourself and party into various edges until you manage your way out? You got it!   Wonderfully engaging story; filled with plenty of characters that are hard to forget. Don't forget the pet pal perk to talk to all of those animals around you! (Beware, you will be sad a lot of times talking to them.) Off put by the concept of reading a ton of dialogue? (Why are you buying this...) then worry not! Every single character (and animal) is fully voiced with some amazing VO work. However, the story did let me down in a few small ways, but I'll get to that soon.   Mods mods mods! The community has been excellent at coming up with some very inventive and fun mods to use throughout your adventure. Anything from new classes, new spells, revamping certain systems, and if you're a glutton for punishment - mods that make the game even harder. Cons  Remember how I mentioned how amazing the story was? Yeah, well that’s for the majority! As some others have mentioned, going into the final act and ending, there are some definite inconsistencies with the quality of writing and apparently attention to lore. (I've never played any other Divinity games;  I was unaware until doing further research.) For a game that boasts such a wide range of choices and how they really matter; the ending(s) seemed largely basic and almost unrelated to your adventures throughout the game.   Technical problems. Any game of this size will be bound to suffer from some technical issues, I completely get that. Overall, it was nothing major - apart from one game breaking bug I encountered causing some invisible enemies to 1 hit KO me, but luckily, I had a save from not long before that I managed to get back to and the problem seemed to have fixed itself. While the bugs weren't outright angering - in the final act I did find myself getting increasingly peeved by the buildup of several small bugs affecting my experience. At times enemies will take AGES to take their turn - leaving you to simply sit there and watch them and their idle animation until they finally realize they should be doing something.    Tech probs cont. The camera and reticule would at times completely spaz out and throw itself in a random direction and would continue to do so whenever trying to target certain areas or enemies. This may have been due to some mods interfering with the code, but at times my journal would be completely wiped of all data - leaving me to have to remember what quests I still needed to do.   Balance issues. Exploring the various locales sometimes leads you into areas where you are WOEFULLY unprepared or situations that unless you had prior knowledge, are borderline impossible to defeat. While it didn't bug me too much, I frequently encountered some dialogue/enemies that upon entering the fight would instant kill my party, use the same skill numerous times with seemingly no cooldown like the heroes, or somehow know exactly the best way to take out a party member. (Did I mention I was playing on explorer? The 'easiest' mode of them all) In the end though, I loved this game and every single minute I put into it. Some problems did irk me enough to slightly lower my score, but ultimately, I'm marking this game down as one of my favorite RPGs of all-time.  9.5/10"
Ethrin,894,51,3,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,68.6,"I'm still working my way through the introduction of the game (haven't gotten past the first city), but so far I'm loving it! I'm playing on the Classic difficulty, and there are two difficulties higher than this one.  My characters are now level 7, but this is still an early review, as I have yet to complete act 1.  Pros: 1.) Combat is incredibly tactical. There have been a couple of fights where I got my butt handed to me because I didn't think to exploit the terrain or the destructibles placed in the battlefield.  Height matters a lot more in this game, especially if you have a huntsman. 2.) Oddly, the soundscape is amazing.  Walking through town you can hear the bustling of people walking around. It sounds great when you're in a dungeon, along the beach, and everywhere.   3.) Voiceovers, world building, and characters has been spot on so far.  I have found some characters to be really funny, and others to be incredibly intriguing, such as Losche. 4.) The game doesn't prevent you from doing things out of order.  Once you escape from Fort Joy, it really opens up and allows you to wander around the map in any direction.   Cons: 1.) Don't get me wrong, the UI is pretty well done in this game.  However, there are some UI'isms that I would like improved.  Such as being able to send all of my ""wares"" to one character (who has the highest bartering skill).   2.) Saved game bloat bug.  Right now there is an issue with saved games getting extremely bloated to the point where it can take a long time for my computer to upload the saved games to the cloud.    Closing Thoughts: This is definitely a CRPG that has had a lot of love and time put into it.  It will ask a lot of you (time wise) to get going, but so far, it has been a really enjoyable ride!  I definitely recommend it so far, and I will update as I get further into the game.  EDIT: Updated with some more pros and cons.

Liezerota,635,46,1,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,48.9,"Alright, let me start off by saying this game offers choices... And not just the illusion of choices, every situation you encounter has so many ways to get through that it's not too improbable to say you could most likely replay this game for thousands of hours and never get bored.  This game is more or less dungeons & dragons in a game engine, while you could say other games are like dungeons & dragons this game practically IS dungeons & dragons, aside from the fact that unless you're playing game master mode you can't make things like persuasion checks in the midst of combat/etc.  It would be an injustice to call this game anything but a masterpiece, it easily sits on top of the rpg world, rivaling all including possibly my #1 rpg of all time Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup[crawl.develz.org]. If you're looking to buy the PC GOTY, then it's gotta be D:OS 2, it's far too much for me to try and describe this game... you owe it to yourself to try this game and experience it."

Halwin,838,156,5,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,190.5,"C'mon, become Overwhelmingly Positive already! While at the time of writing this review, I haven't even gotten past the first Act yet, I nevertheless feel compelled to write a review for this beautiful game. For me the game's highlight is its excellently designed turn-based combat. There are no potentially pesky RNG elements and therefore every fight follows the same strict rules allowing you to have full control over how every battle plays out. There's also an insane amount of skills that are open to each and every character, and free to combine at your leisure (half of the fun is simply experimenting!). While the game is very very challenging (in a good and fair way!), I never felt the need to look up guides as with some thought you are more than able to compose your own diverse team of heroes (except maybe on hard difficulty - but don't play that until you finished Classic!). The voice acting is also superb, with tons and tons of spoken dialogue and different choices you can make. Also initiating a dialogue with another of your team members may open up a whole different story which may reveal more of the character you are interacting with or the world around you. Finally, the graphics look more than impressive enough considering the game's genre, and the level design has nothing to complain about.  Admittedly, no game is without its flaws though and I will summarise my, minor, grievances here. Inventory management is still a hassle. It's a common issue for RPGs, and I'm not sure if there ever will be a game that's perfect in that regard, but with four party members, switching items to and fro, out and in of backpacks and the like, becomes a considerable hassle. Especially when it can be hard to discern between quest items, crafting materials, fluff, and junk. To add to that, civic skills like bartering and lucky charm (increases your chance to find rare items with that player only) are not group-wide, meaning that you will have to switch items (and gold) to and fro your characters yet again to reap the maximum gold and good gear. Frankly, I don't bother with the last two because it's a serious nuisance, and it doesn't really make the game too hard without. Nevertheless a fix to this inconvenience would be appreciated. Furthermore, certain skills are either useless - initiative: determines the play order during a fight for your team only, meaning that having one at 13, then 12, 11, 10 is sufficient and any extra points are basically lost, - or certain skills provide odd bonuses - warfare: a melee oriented skill that apparantly is the best damage increase for rangers as well (I do have a ranger in my team with 5 huntsman and 0 warfare however, and he's perfectly viable on Classic. I only need to make sure he's positioned with a height advantage, which is actually how the game intended rangers to be played). Last, but not least, there's no way to change party members during a conversation, meaning that if you are forced into a dialogue (probably because he/she was closest to the conversation starter) with someone and a persuasion check needs to be passed, it is impossible to have your player with skill in pursuasion take it over (this led to frequent quickloads for me). Basically during dialogue your team members turn into mutes unless they are scripted to take part in the conversation.   I didn't intend for the second paragraph to be longer than the first, and I would recommend to pay more focus to the great things this game offers rather than the minor nuisances. I will give this game a higher rating once some (or all) of these issues are addressed, which I actually expect they will.   TL;DR: A must buy even at full price! It currently has the well deserved spot of #10th best game ever!  P.S. Feel free to reply to this review with questions; I usually reply rapidly. Also, if you decided to buy the game after reading this I'd be happy to help you out with the game, or play with you co-op if our times align! :)  Rating: 9.0/10 Halwin's 100% Completion RecommendationDifficulty: Unsure, but considering honour mode achievement I expect 9/10. Time: Expect it to be easily 150+ hours  Will update this section once I have completed the game."

applekwisp,332,25,3,"December 14, 2017",Recommended,101.0,"Great RPG, probably one of the best games of 2017. It's strengths lie in an amusing colorful world, with and intresting, serious, yet lighthearted fantasy setting. The game is actually very rough around the edges the longer you play. It's polish runs out in the last 2 chapters as they feel rushed and maybe even unfinished. The difficulty curve of the game feels off since near the start it's very challenging, but towards the end you will become an unstoppable killing machine. Though there were many improvements over the first game, I still felt the first game had a better, focused story, better armor system, combat system (AP management) and pacing.  Pros  Lengthy RPG  Large variety of skills and character customization options  Dialogue is fun an intresting, a lot of world building in game  Combat is fun (though flawed). World skills like teleporting, pyramids, pickpocketing are intresting  Combat is very strategic (almost to a fault)  Very fair price for content. 100 hour playthrough doing every single quest I could. Cons  (Pro and Con I think) Teleport becomes a less useful skill in this game because of the availability of so many movement abilities to everyone.  A lot of broken achievements. Examples: pray at every altar on nameless isle, the quests associated with sebille, fane, most companions i assume  New armor system is bad. Encourages stacking either physical or magical damage. Late game it becomes irrelvant, everything is a one shot fest or everyone has an ability to completely strip your armor/magic resist  AP system is too limited compared to first game  Too many status effects and they are inconsistent. For example Rupture tendons can be used against armor, but bleeding will be blocked  Literally every battle will end covered in necrofire/fire. It makes bless a useless skill since it will ALWAYS be overwritten.  Source skills useless for first 2 areas, since you will never have enough source to use them (and wonder if they are worth saving for a truly difficult part that never comes) and overpowered for the rest of the game. Makes for a boring mechanic considering how central to the plot it is. Bless, source vampirism, and spirit vision aren't really compelling godwoken abilities honestly.  The story kind of forgets itself in the 2nd area. The game feels like a means to explore and do fun RPGeque quests, but the plot takes a backseat to it.  The final act feels unfinished. I felt like I ran into solutions to quests accidently more often than the ""correct"" way. Final battle and final choices don't feel like they were explained or fleshed out.  (EARLY SPOILER)The compnaion interaction with the game feels to forced. Everyone you meet is one of the most important people in the world. The companions who you don't pick early on, continuously show up even though you have no attachement to them at all.  Crafting, like in the first game, is exceptionally bad. You can never preview what the recipe is going to make. The receipe UI is super cluttered. Exiperimentaion is cumbersome. It's mostly luck based guessing, with a few ""skill books"". Good luck sorting through the UI with no search function or filters to get anything useful. Ignore the crafting system completely despite there being decent receipes like boots + nails, or status immunity potions. Overall a great game probably the GOTY, but I would reccomend people give the first game a chance beacuse I truly believe it is the better title between the two. A few of the characters and plot points carry over so it's worth taking into consideration before playing this game regardless. I feel like after a few patches, maybe an expansion, this game can be fixed up to be almost perfect, but for DOS is still the best example of kickstarter success and a modern CRPG with a classic taste to it."

Note when they join you get to choose their class (which is a great, original idea) but their race is fixed. Later on, you can respec all of their ability/talent/skill point selections if you want.

[FTA]TatsuyaSuou,289,131,20,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,114.8,"While there isn't a lot that hasn't already been addressed in other positive reviews, I feel obligated to address some of the negative reviews I continually see regarding the game's difficulty.  Like any strategy-oriented game, Divinity Original Sin 2 requires quite a bit of premeditation before entering combat to guarantee success (outside of Tactician mode anyway, more on that later).    The game expects you to use the tools it gives you in each encounter though the largest issue I've seen is when you enter a new section of the game.  Before you go exploring to much it's almost mandatory to address the guaranteed difficulty creep by checking out any and all new gear/skillbooks/potions etc are available in whatever new social area you encounter.  With the game's economy being what it is, having one character geared toward thievery and another set up with a significant amount of barter goes an incredibly long way toward alleviating the need to almost constantly upgrade your gear when entering a new section of the game.  The point I'm making is that the game gives you all the tools you need to address any gear issues you might have the moment you set foot in a new town. This goes for skill books as well as there is no limit to how many books you can learn as long as you have the commensurate ranks in the associated skill and sufficient memory slots to equip them.   Anyway, the TL;DR of all that is the game gives you all the tools you need to PREPARE for difficult fights so long as you actually use them.  All that said, the AI isn't a slouch.  It can and will abuse whatever environmental things are to hand and the devs have set up a great many of the fights to favor the enemies.  This means that as a player the onus is on you to think about the party you want to put together before just trying to breeze through the game.  There are so many ways to make strong characters in D:OS 2 that they're almost limitless.  What you CAN'T do and expect to be successful is to just blindly charge into every fight and new situation with your d*** at full mast (just a turn of phrase, no offense intended ladies).  If that's the playstyle you're after there are a dozen Diablo clones or ARPGs out there that are better suited to that frame of mind.  D:OS2 has a turned-based system for a reason and is incredibly rewarding just so long as you apply some forethought to engagements. In fact, it's easily the best RPG I've played since the early 2000s in terms of gameplay.   Panning a game for being difficult is a non-starter, especially when it's only as hard as you make it by lack of planning. Unless, of course, you're playing on Tactician mode.  If you're doing that, you deserve whatever mental anguish you're suffering from because that is almost entirely designed for masochists who like to sit bare♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on a saguaro cactus.  If that's you, by all means, buy stock in razor blades or whatever but I would seriously hope to not see any complaints about difficulty."

The depth is awesome, this is really the first game of this specific genre I have played, and I'm glad I took the risk on it. Incredibly immersing enviroments, music, story and characters. You really feel part of this world. Combat is very deep and I actually restarted the game twice before I was happy enough with my build and companions. Takes a bit of time if you are new to this series to get used to how classes and roles work, and how you should be building your team, but once you get the hang of it, it's fairly straightforward. The only negative I felt was that the journal gave a lack of direction on quests and objectives in general, but as soon as you stop treating them like quests and more like parts of a dynamic story it doesn't really matter. You can fail some, or do things wrong and that's okay it's part of your story. Often doing the wrong thing can get you some nice loot or information that helps you in some other way. Love it."

hawxace06,177,23,1,"June 7, 2017",Recommended,261.3,"On release everything seems to work perfectly for me. I have had no issues with the game at all, and even alone the voice acting is keeping me playing. Feel free to check some valid negative reviews for problems that will most likely be fixed. And remember, there is always the option to reload to rethink and plan. Lets hope this stays constant through the game.  Ok, the Quest Log is broken as mentioned alot. And I found a couple of bugs.  The devs are working to fix problems, but they just do not have enough people to find all the bugs. I am 100% sure the game will be fleshed out within a couple months.  I also have heard that act 3 is kind of broken in a way, which I will experience myself. So far everything is beautiful and feels good, the graphics, audio, story telling, companions and all the other stuffs. As someone who enjoys smething and goes back afterwords to see everything, this will be a great experience.    Early Access review: Before you buy: Please go play atleast some of the first game if you wanted to play this. It is finished so a new player can enjoy the full experience. I have just been reading people complain about the early access too much to ignore this.     Oh and I very strongly recommend getting a friend to join you (There is a 2 player pack I pretty sure if you are feeling generous.) Without a friend that you can enjoy playing with,the beginning will be a struggle as it is a bit misleading.     Also the game is difficult in a way that makes a person have to think critically, making a restart is inevitable unless you are either a master at these games or just have played it a while. Having another person to talk to about positioning and cc (main points of the game) really makes a restart less frusturating and more of a learning experience until you get into the groove.  If you get this game I seriously hope you enjoyed it as much as the first one. Although I haven't beaten it completely I have enjoyed every step of the teleporting mess that it is.  Also. If you can only buy one get this one. Both are really great though"

EDIT  And now since people started saying this isn't a review. no it is not it is simply a joke when i first started the game without any clue as to what i might end up with. i was at a moment of weakness when i just got my salary and came home drunk. so the next morning i started playing the game. here's an actual review based on my 9 hours of playtime.  the pros: -you have total freedom on how you want to play the game  (could also be seen as a con at times)  -indepth turnbased combat  (height matters and you have to anticipate that sometimes out from the shadows people can turn up to kill you)  -the origin characters have rich personality's and you don't really have to play as them to influence their story since they can also be your companions.  -story length.  there are 3 story acts that have a suprisingly long playtime and each time you want to replay it it's almost always different since like i said you have total freedom over what you will do. ( i play multiple characters but right now i am about 6 hours in on my undead witch and i haven't even come close to finish act 1 and from what i've heard of others act 1 can easily become 15 hours of playtime)  -OPTIMIZATION! this game's beautifull combat effects can clutter your whole screen and your computer (or laptop) can still run it smoothly  Now some small cons:  -*total freedom on how you play. sure is nice to play it however you want but... you must also discover each mechanic yourself (this is also how Grumps started a fight because i accidentally stole a book infront of the magister and also may have hit her with a knife before) also you can miss allot of story contents if you randomly kill people.  -tutorial is a bit vague sometimes and forgettable when you get too much on your plate because at same time you are fighting and trying to predict what your enemy is going to do.  after this there aren't many cons about this game that i can mention until i have actually experienced the full game and not just act 1. call me biased but just of the sheer size of the game you should try it. i can already sense this has allot of replay value."

I have tried to keep several NPC's alive through fights only to have them turn against me during the conversation that automatically follows combat because they have taken damage from fire. Few other smaller issues I have noticed, occasionally characters abilities are greyed out during battle, quick save and reload seems to fix this.

If you're looking for an RPG where you feel powerful but are also constantly challenged to improve both in skill and level, then this game is for you.  However this game is not for you if you are bored by dialogue, this game is not for you if you dislike complexity and having to actually learn how to play and this game is not for you if you you require instant gratification.  For me, this game plays like a western version of a JRPG, with many characters to join your party, a deep complex story and many ways for you to affect the story.  The combat is turn based which allows for more depth in the combat system and more strategic options.  If you haven't tried turn based combat before, this is a great way to try it.  It's like Diablo but for intelligent adults.  Each origin character provides with a completely different gameplay experience even if you play them as the same class.  Overall, as an RPG, I give DOSII a 10/10 on a curved scale.  Unparalleled in the modern PC market and preferrable to the most recent console offering Final Fantasy 15."

writergrimm,90,25,2,March 23,Recommended,112.9,"A rare case where the sequel is even better than the original. Put in over 100 hours on this game and loved nearly every minute of it. If you love story driven rpgs where the world you roam gives you adventure at every turn - this game is for you.   Positives: The myraid of ways you can build a character. I opted for more of a ""Warden"" route and enjoyed the freedom of veering outside of the confines of the usually locked in advancement systems found elsewhere.  The NPCs and their contribution to nearly every scene as well as their own storylines. I will admit I got a mod to allow me to take all of them along. Not so that the game would be easier but rather so I could experience all of their storylines in one playthrough. I was not disappointed. Best character development I have seen in an rpg in a long long time.  How big and developed the world is. Nearly every corner has you encountering some mystery, npc, adventure, or clue. Sometimes it can even be a little overwhelming but with time and effort - you can start mapping out everything.  The combat system. The built upon the previous one and improved its flaws. In the original, I would grenade and area effect arrow the hell out of everything. Sometimes allowed me to breeze through fights that should have required strategy. This time out - there isn't any overt easy tactics. In quite a few fights, you have to bring your strategy A game or die repeatedly.  Negatives Some of the puzzles got too clever for themselves and go well outside of the established routines of how to solve them. While in some cases this worked well, there are quite a few that gave you no starting reference point of how to even begin to solve them. This can lead to quite a bit of frustration and then gets compounded with the occasional bug that pretty much leads to a roll back save to try a different approach just to avoid the bug.   Endings. Big fan of anime here so I understand the idea of endings that aren't exactly clean but damn... the one that takes care of the most things literally nullifies the entire purpose of the game.   I NEED some Malady DLC!   In any event, highly recommend this game. One of the best I have ever played.   "
Heaveness,173,21,1,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,127.8,"I wanted to put at least minimum 20 hours into this game before I gave it a review. I can safely say that this is one of the best RPG games you will ever find, it's one of those games that will earn the definition of classic cRPG decades later. Normally I don't play a lot of turn-based tactical RPGs in my lifetime because I find the genre not my biggest interest but this game did a fantastic job enticing me into its universe.   Q: How does the game run? Any bugs or crashes or technical issues? A: In 30 hours of playing I have encounter maybe 1 or 2 bugs but I find them minor, for example, some quests did not classify as finished when I just got the reward for it. I have not experienced a single crash in any of my games and did not run to any framerate issues.  Q: Do you recommend it or not? A: Absolutely recommend it! The game is very well-made, the developers really poured their heart and soul into this game and it shows. It has online & local splitscreen coop, PvP, Tactical combat, controller support, mods, great writing, so much paths and methods to tackle any quest, Game Master Mode, and much more. I can tell the Larian Studios had a blast making this and it's thanks to them and the kickstarters backers that help fund this fantastic game.  Overall score: 10/10 Pros:  +Fun and challenging tactical combat  +Easy to get into but hard to master +Interesting and unique characters with the companions having their own origin stories. +Mod Support +A well-implemented coop feature that doesn't feel tacked on. +Beautiful Soundtrack +Definitely more than 100 hours of content. +Very well polished with little to no bugs or crashes and haven't experienced any framerate issues so far. +Game Master Mode which is a DnD style game which is a interesting way to play the game with friends. +Multiple ways to tackle an objective. +You have a ton of freedom and choice. +The graphics look great with some pretty locations. +So much secrets and this game encourages to carefully look and explore its world.  Neutral: =The voice acting for the most part is good but some are odd and feels inconsistent when it comes to the audio quality but it does its job. =The quest journal I find to be a clunky with the map. When you have multiple quests active, you have multiple markers on the map that just seems messy and confusing. Although it is not hard to figure out what you are suppose to be doing. =A few quality-of-life changes would have been nice like increasing the walking speed outside of combat or having the hotbar not be cluttered whenever you pick up an item like a grenade. Luckily these two problems can be fixed with a mod.  Cons: -Honestly there is zero cons I can think of for this game, other than on higher difficulties the enemies like to use a lot of cheese tactics which can be frustrating to deal with but you can use those same tactics on them too.  I'll definitely play this game much more and I have still a lot more content to explore and be playing them with my friends whenever I get the chance. I highly recommend you get this game, I gave it a 10/10 rating not as a ""This game is perfect in every way,"" the game has a few issues, but it's more of a ""This game is worth every penny of your purchase"" kind of rating. Pick this game up for yourself or with 3 other friends, you will not regret it! "

Ramdhanu,265,13,0,January 14,Recommended,173.9,"Divinity Original Sin 2.  While Original Sin was already a good RPG game and had plenty to offer, I was a bit skeptical that whether or  not Larian Studios could top that. But boy did they. Original Sin 2 is better than the first in every way. It’s safe to say that Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of the best, if not the best RPG of year,especially for us old school pen & paper rpg lovers.  While RPG's are all about choices & consequences & development of your character,you don't find many PC RPG's that offer this kind of choices,where your decisions and actions are so impactful. Meaning, You can kill an NPC related to the main quest,try to steal from a vendor & loose access to their inventory,build your dream character or a good for nothing crew,the choices are limitless . There is always another way to take care of your duties if you fail in one. In other worlds, Larian was able to  PUT THE R BACK IN RPG in this game.  Another really strong aspect of Divinity Original Sin 2 is its characters,especially the SIX Origin Characters to choose from who have rich backstories and amazing voice-acting to boot. Similar to Dragon Age Origins,the Origins lets you play as unique characters with their own agendas & goals. And if you want to create a custom character,then fret not,you can have them as companions in your journey. One piece of advice though. There's a nasty piece of surprise waiting for you at the end of ACT 1. So choose & build your companions carefully.  As far as gameplay is concerned, there’s nothing new or innovative in terms of gameplay, but rather, a refined version of what we’ve already had for years. The only thing complicated is stuff like crafting or spell combinations and such. But once you have a general idea of how they work, you’ll be breezing through them.  The game also  comes with an amazing soundtrack, very fitting for whatever situation you’re in. Additionally, the VFX sounds, be it for blood spatter or whatever fancy spell you’re flinging, and the sounds that the weird creatures and characters you come across make, it all fits right in place. Not to mention,the entire game is voice acted & makes the experience all the more enjoyable, especially for those experiencing the genre for the first time.  Similarly, no complaints with the visuals. While it’s not an extremely graphic intensive by today’s standards, but still it delivers a very visually appealing experience. The environments look great and the details in the surroundings, be it inside a ship, or a cabin, or out in the open (anywhere really), is amazing.  Overall, one will have a hard time finding another RPG like this one around. Divinity does a lot of things right and I have to hand it to Larian Studios for creating an RPG masterpiece here. The plethora of options that actually matter, the rich characters, the story itself, this game has a lot going for it. You won't & cannot go wrong with buying this game,whether on full price or on a deal.  My Verdict 9.5/10.  PS : Fund Divinity Original Sin 3 if they are going to create it in the future. What Larian has shown us so far, it is well worth to pay them the full price & something extra for their efforts."

ArenMook,174,16,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,390.6,"If you've enjoyed the first Divinity: Original Sin, you owe it to yourself to pick up this one. Larian took everything that was great about the first game and made it even better.  Word of warning though, it's easier to screw up in DOS2 than it is in DOS1. Literally a minute into the game you can either recruit or kill your first companion, simply depending on how you talk to them.  Stealing mechanics changed from DOS1 -- both guards and whoever owns the item will actively seek out the thief (you), and should they find you red-handed, throw you in prison, attack or simply take the stolen merchandise, again depending on how you talk your way out of the situation. Fortunately even if you choose the violent option, the game is still perfectly playable. Merchants and civilians don't participate in the fight.  I'd write more, but I think I'll just go ahead and play some more instead."
Kad,9,29,0,August 30,Recommended,66.4,"Originally I wasn't going to review this game on this account because I have few hours on this account. However, reading through some of the reviews out there, I wanted to speak my piece.  This game changes things from the previous game in the series. And some argue that it makes the game harder, forcing you to play as a certain type of character. However, I feel the need to point out that you are only forced into playing a certain way if you desire to be the absolute best possible character in the game. People say that mixed damage parties are not viable because of the armor system in the game. (If you are unaware, every character in the game has an amount of Physical Armor and Magical Armor. These armors prevent damage and certain effects until they are depleted.) However, me and a friend did a playthrough of this game, and we played as a mixed damage party. For those who are interested, we had: a Summoner who also had abilities in Aerothurge, Pyrokinetic and Geomancer. That was my main. a Ranger who focused on long range physical damage, but also dabbled in Pyrokinetic. That was my secondary character. a Rogue who focused almost entirely on Physical damage. That was my friend's main. a Cleric who used Hydrosophist and Warfare, and acted as our team's tank. That was my friends secondary character. The point of that is to show that we had a diverse build to our team. Sure, it may not have been the most effective. But do you know what it was? Fun. We had a lot of fun playing that party. So, before you get this game, ask yourself this. Do I want to be able to create a character who is unique to my playstyle, even if they are not necessarily the best? If you say yes, then you will enjoy this game. There are so many options for what you can do. However, if you want to build the best possible character, then unfortunately, you will likely be disappointed with how you will need to build a certain way. However, is that not what something being the best mean? If one object is better than all other objects of the same type, does that not mean that in that catagory, there is no other choice besides that one object? It is the same for looking at the builds in Divinity: Original Sin 2. Yes, one is better than all the other. However, if you only play to have the best build, then I think you are missing the entire point of the game. This game is meant to be a medium for telling a story, for sharing memories. While you can play the game alone, it is my belief that for the true experience of the game, you should play it with friends. And when you do, feel free to play however you desire. I will lead to some good laughs when you look back at it."
Aisukurimu,24,12,0,May 30,Recommended,595.9,"In short, this is a game of high replayability with an immensely immersive world.    Quests Quests are in one way or another, interrelated to each other, they are not shallow ""fetch quests"" and each one actually reflects a little bit about the world of Rivellon. Players are not required to complete quests in any certain ways as each path you take is considered progression towards the ultimate goal. There are also  multiple ways to approach a single quest, whether it is to be a righteous individual and not ask for reward; to be a villain who only cares for your own self interest; or having to choose between two evils knowing either choice will have undesirable sacrifices. You could encourage a man to not dwell on pursuing vengeance and be merciful, perhaps that man will not stray from his righteous path, but he might  lose something/someone else .    Gameplay In terms of gameplay, I was initially not a fan of turn-based combat, which is largely what this game is about. I was more accustomed to ARPG-like combat as seen in Diablo 3. However, I allow myself to give this game a try despite my dislike of turn-based combat. It was a good decision as I later found myself so engaged by the turn-based combat in this game. Combat in this game has  great depth due to abilities being able to interact with the game environment, like creating chain explosions by casting fire on a poison/oil surface; or electrocuting an enemy and stunning him because you've already pre-casted a water surface beneath him. What's more amazing is that the  combat AI also make use of these mechanics! The combat has great potential for a highly strategic approach and it is very satisfying to see your strategies in effect. After multiple playthroughs, I realised that there are so many possible approaches to a single fight, and sometimes one mistake is all it takes to bring the player down from an advantageous position that could ultimately mean deaths of characters or even defeat of the whole party (The combat AI is no joke on higher difficulties, really smart and makes really calculated moves, which made the game more fun for me).    General experience In terms of the general RPG experience, personally I think the game has a  good amount of both combat and dialogues/stories. Dialogues are fully voiced and occasionally amusing. NPCs' responses in dialogue actually depend on players' races. There are also ""tags"" which can be selected when creating a custom character, these  tags allow you to do certain things that other tags cannot. For example, a character with a Scholar tag can interpret ancient tomes and gain knowledge from it; whereas a character with a Mystic tag is able to use their own sheer will to repel evil presence possessing innocent people to attack travellers. There are also ""Origin"" characters, which are essentially characters that already have their own backgrounds in the world of Rivellon and by playing as them/recruiting them as companions, you gain access to their own quests that might sometimes  intertwine with other Origin characters' quests.    Conclusion These are my personal views on what makes this game great for me. There are more exciting features that this game has which I don't think a single review can contain. If you like RPG games that leaves you an empty space after completing it, this is one such game. And the price tag is definitely modest for a game this big."

Nether,23,28,0,"August 7, 2017",Recommended,215.5,"Im super excited for the release date, if you're into Dragon Age or RPGs with turn-based combat, Id /strongly/ recommend it.   This is the first of the DOS games I tried, but after trying the alpha, which Ive spent 30 hours in (of the ""suggested"" 8-12 hours), I went back and played the D:OS 1, I was genuinely surprised to see it was a decent game, but also realizing that it actually is lightyears behind this one, D:OS 2.   It doesnt have the live combat, which DA has, but its turn based where the attack time is based on your characters' strengths and weakness' (for lack of better simplistic explanation) - Id personally take the real time action over this one, but it still seems to be well-made.   I think its a bit deceiving with the main character's customization, as the characters you find throughout the game can matter just as much, if not more. Only benefit is a bit of options to change the look. Additionally, I think its a shame you can swap the discovered characters in between different ""conflicting speccs"" as you find them, as in, mage OR warrior and not just pick between whether you want the warrior to be in a defensive or aggressive build - it ruins a bit of the RP feel of the characters in my mind. You could have the option to swap between the conflicting paths, but then you should get a RP story explaining why that it is a possibility, and only have it as a rare trait to some of them. If you're playing on high difficulty, having this would mean you directly need to find a healer/tank/rogue to unlock certain skills/benefits.   Im lacking a bit of character story and overall story, which you can find in the early Dragon Age games, but it hardly affects my belief of the game. Im excited to see how the late game develops, as Im afraid you get overpowered a bit too soon, in addition to the fact that the cookie cutter builds seem to be a bit too either overpowered, or obvious.   One thing I actually spite, is the fact that the amount of discovered/hidden ""legendary"" weapons are slightly too many, and of too high importance. If you're playing on max difficulty, you're almost forced to google to find them, in order to being able to beat the NPC/AI. Atleast this is the case if youre in the range of my skill-level, which admittedly isn't perfect.   Everything I could think of on the spot, September cant come soon enough."

But now I can get to the biggest complaint I have: Voice acting or the lack of. At the moment the only voice acting is in the intro and combat grunting.

The combat is more fluid and enjoyable, the effects are as beautiful as they go most of the time and the dialogue is quite well written.

Ghost of Bukowski,"1,052",132,95,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,152.7,"The Game That Kept Me From Quitting Gaming AltogetherDAMN, I was tired. Beaten and broken to my absolute core. Like Gandalf after the Balrog fight, I lay like roadkill on Gaming’s Last Stand. Left in the ditch by the ravenous, greedy games industry, all but forcing me to violently amputate myself from my hobby after so many years, my thoughts returned to me through the mist of my mind. Game publishers had made me hate gaming more and more with every Microtransaction, Gambling Lootbox, and übergreedy DLC-pettiness, rubbing their scummy hands together, waiting for their chance to turn me so desperate that I'd sell my mum's wheelchair just to be able to play the story of a single player game wholesale instead of in disgusting piece-meal chunks.  Exhausted. Ready to let my hobby die.  Clearing my head to drift forever into the mindless, mainstream, middle-aged hobbies of pathetic Rom-Coms so bad they have to tell you where to laugh, sports night with a team letting you down for 20 years straight, and pedantic tv-gameshow hosts as full of themselves as the CEOs and board members of todays’ AAA game companies.  I had cried out for Mr. Newell, but he was nowhere to be seen. I called out for him again and again, desperately trying to summon the one time so great mythical Valve Overlord to give me a glimpse of Half-Life 3 or some other new IP, for a last incongruent attempt to restore my faith in The Greatest Hobby ever known. But Mr. Newell had sojourned to the evil gates of DOTA 2 many moons ago, and had never been seen since. Every Valve knave had followed their once and future king, but in their wake had only left silence for those few of us who still cared. Their footprints, all leading to DOTA 2, and not one leading back, had all but vanished.  And amidst the Consumer Forest behind Valve Village, there was talk of another presence, only whispered in fear, between creeping darkness and depressive thoughts; Artifact... Artifact... The wind carried the promise of a terrible omen, of yet another unnecessary card game to come, assuring the deliverance of the final strike into the once golden, now charred, heart of gaming. And Mr. Newell never appeared in this, my darkest hour. The heroic saviour was lost to time and space as he had succumbed to The Void of Game Industry Indifference.  My mind wandered. Valve Village lay in ruins. Long was the time since anyone had fixed anything on the barricades of Team Fortress, and the walls of Counter-Life: Grognard Operations' padded cells had crumbled, leaving demons and hell-outcasts running rampant and harassing any remaining villagers. There were rumors that some of the worst of these creatures had even snuck after Gabe through the gates of DOTA, in the Unholiest of Unholy joinings of good and evil, but none had heard back from them either. The Portals to the temple of Half-Life were rusted to a sad metal heap, and the temple they guarded had lied dormant for centuries with no Programmer Priests or Artist Acolytes left to work on the Half-Life religion. Valve Village was a ghost town. Dying at last, together with me.  I felt my body getting numb. I knew I was close to exhaling my last breath of gaming. Doomed to never experience the warm freedom from pathetic corporate game publisher mind tricks. Never allowed again to experience the sheer joy of a great game not tormented by CEO and board member greed.  I closed my eyes.  I made my peace with everything. Accepting of Bobby Kotick’s miniscule loaf-member, mercilessly drilling down the insides of my throat and demolishing my gag reflex for all time. No more protesting Zenimax’ and Bethesda’s Pete Hines lying and lying, his nose getting longer and longer inbetween my butt cheeks as he denounced the fact that their new paid mods system is indeed paid mods. I let out a poor sigh as I came to terms with EA’s horror show, drowning me and their other customers in blank-white secrete of filthy business decisions, in amounts so vast they could shave their chiseled, unethical game publisher jawline in the mirroring reflection of my soaked forehead.  Nothing mattered anymore. We, the customers, had lost. And as a single tear ran down my cheek, gaming was dead and gone forever. I embraced the darkness and muttered a final prayer to the gaming gods of old, before feeling a last remaining speckle of life vanish from my veins. My gamer soul was ready. I was to return home to 8bit, 16bit, Playstation and PC; to the 80s and 90s gaming heaven. Far away from the grotesque demonic onslaught hell here, far from the karmic injustice of game publishers burning the industry down until they had extinguished its last pittance of grace. I was ready. And darkness came.  Then, movement.  Not from me. Outside of me.  A feather of light touched my eyes. A vague, finely tuned iota beam, shimmering onto my eyelids. It tormented my weak sight, but it was real! A light, a light! My body jolted as it shone towards me from the distant skies. My butt-crack ravaged, my throat sore, my forehead glistening with horrible, sticky Microtransaction DLC. I was not dead yet, there was a game title coming closer, flapping it's angel wings as it descended upon my old, withered gamer soul. And I could see the shape and the coming of Divinity: Original Sin 2 as the air around me became warmer and I felt life returning to me.  Larian had come to my rescue. They would not let me fall to the demonic creature game publisher overlords. They would conquer this Normandy, they would sail this Pacific. They would go on until the end. And no micro DLC could stand in their way of delivering the atomic bomb which destiny would have in itself the strenght and honour to become 2017s GOTY.  Long live Larian, the New Gamer Wine. The Future World Leader in cRPGs. The Youthful Lords of Gaming.  Support this developer. Sell your kids, dogs, and a kidney if you must. But support them, please. Drop them a bundle of cash from a helicopter, write your will today and give it all to Larian. Or do something else more or less creative. But promise me you’ll support them.

Sorry to all other candidates; you had clever minds, firm bottoms and perky puppies, but when Larian is sporting the combinad sass of Audrey Horne, beauty of an elven princess and the lust of a thousand pornstars to entertain me, there just isn't any competition worth to be had anymore.

raubrey,456,26,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,650.8,"Simply one of the best RPGs I've played, ever.   It will be very difficult to replay some of my old-school games having played this now, as I'm ready to replay it again.   I can't really think of a quality that is lacking for a proper RPG -- companions, combat, story (a little bumpy in spots if you're not used to Divinity lore), music, voice acting, dialog, puzzles, loot, character building....it's all there.  Plus the fact the tone is both dark and clever with many humorous moments yet not very goofy and cartoony like the first one is a real winner in my book.   There are a few bugs here and there, but other than that, I feel it deserves the GoTY Award.   Update: PC Gamer 2017 Game of the Year Award I guess I have good taste...or PC Gamer does. Yeah, I'll go with the latter, the former wasn't in doubt.   Nominated for Steam Award: Better than Expected"
Shraska,116,81,8,"November 7, 2016",Recommended,125.1,"[I played through the early access at November 7th]  THE GOOD!+ New races to play  + No ""pawns"", so full 4-player Co-op available  + Alot of improvements from the first game  + Overall graphical upgrades  + New special ability system   THE BAD!- You always feel Overpowered   - Stats need rebalancing. Going full initiative makes sure you always get to play first. You can kill all enemies before they have a first turn (on highest difficulty!)  - Obvious huge gaps in item upgrades  - Pickpocketing still way too broken (unlimited gold/all shopitems for free)  - Having 1% magic armor is enough to stop all debuffs  - Enemies too easy to crowd control (stun / freeze / knock down spam)  - Rangers STILL do too much damage (very broken in first game)  - No penalty for poor intelligence / low magic skill. Your spells will always land and you will always have 100% chance to crowd control. You can have a warrior/rogue/ranger hybrid mage. Having a pure mage is such a waste.  - Whole game revolves around the ""teleport"" spell or simular transportation abilities  - TOO many abilities that allow you to escape or move enemies. You can never get hit by melee enemies, and you can always teleport enemy ranger/mage infront of your melee team and just insta-kill them on highest difficulty.  - Almost all of the quests are broken. If you don't do them in the correct order (which means you can't explore anything) you can never complete them. Even the final quest of Act 1  - When you start a fight, your characters run around and position them selves very awkwardly. Even if you pre-set them in high ground etc they will run down and just stand somewhere totally unconvenient  - Sometimes the conversations always end in the same way, no matter what you choose to say. For example; you argue with an NPC. The outcome is exactly the same no matter if you win or lose the argument  - Argument stats (intimidate, wits, intelligence etc) don't matter. If you have maxed out your strenght you will still lose intimidation checks vs. cowards, if that's what the game-designers intended.  CONCLUSION! • All non-direct damage spells need to be nerfed alot.   • Debuff vs. magic armor system needs to be reworked.  • Conversations need to matter (it's an RPG for crying out loud..)  • Exploring shouldn't be punished by breaking quests.  • Crafting is totally pointless and needs to be reworked.  • Pickpockets needs a huge nerf.. since the starting area I have had the best items available to me.    There are alot of things that need improving and changing, obviously it being in EARLY ACCESS. I still recommend the game because I really enjoyed the first one and I know/hope they won't polish this one any less.  Hoping they put alot of effort into balancing things out so I don't feel like a God at level 2 (on highest difficulty);   I will probably rate the game 8/10 when complete (and nerfed)."

Aporis,124,96,16,"October 11, 2017",Recommended,88.0,"TL;DR. A damn crab on the beach is more deeper character than any NPC in Skyrim or Fallout 4 ever. Gameplay is so much more enjoyable and deeper than for example the Witcher series. Characters are relatable and funny like in Mass Effect games! Makes me so salty to think about it that they stuffed all this to one single indie title...  PROS: After finishing my 14 hour tutorial (EDIT: NVM I'm STILL IN THE TUTORIAL) I can already say this game does everything right and I ducking love it! This is the game that made me belive in the game industry again. I didn't like turn based combat, until now. I didn't like isometric point of view, until now. I didn't care too much about ingame conversations, until now. An RPG game you can play with FRIENDS and even cause drama in the scale of Mario Kart! Dialogue is far from monotonic and doesn't take itself too seriously. Voice acting is excellent to the point I found myself stopping to listen to the dialogue even tho I had finished reading it a while ago. I haven't had this rewarding and brain stimulating singleplayer experience for as long as I can remember. I haven't enjoyed this deep, different and open ways of approach to different situations ever in a videogame before.  If you're being like me and see all the reviews and think ""Should I buy this? What if I don't like it? It's so expensive"" JUST BUY IT IN THE NAME OF SOURCE! You won't regret it meow.  CONS: -Can't play accordion. -Steals your life."

GaloreDruid,54,10,1,April 5,Recommended,223.9,"I have not finished this game yet, currently I am approaching the end of act 2. That certainly goes to show something about the amount of content in this game, considering how many hours I've already played this game for. So far, I have a good grasp on what this game is like, so I'll give you a list of the good and bad.  Pros: Lots of content You have the option to do what quests you want to Quests have multiple ways of doing them Insane freedom is given in this game which I think RPGs tend to be lacking in (for story choices) Difficult fights that give a sense of achievement Variety of fights (no 2 fights are the same) The story Dialogue is all voice acted. Voice lines sound like there was a lot of thought put into each one. Dialogue for animals when you have pet pal This game achieves having a serious tone while having humor at the same time Descriptions for items are hilarious (ex. dismembered foot, ""All five toes, check! An attacked leg, Uhhhh..."" or when you click on a globe the narrator says, ""And you thought Rivellon was flat"") Insignificant NPCs still have voice lines, which really improves the immersion into the game You can steal whatever you want and kill whoever you want, however, there is an attitude system that punishes you for that Origin Characters in the game have interesting back stories The game allows you to have a romance with all the origin characters, including a ♥♥♥♥ing skeleton, no more needs to be said. There are no traditional classes you are stuck to. You can mix and match whatever spells you want. For example, you could try going double shields with no weapon, and the spell ""shield throw."" I don't know why you would want to do it, but its possible The game is begging to be replayed with all the different builds on characters, origin character stories, and the ridiculous amount of choices you can make. The game has a tag system where your character earns tags through their actions, which gives you more dialogue options, and determines how npcs react to you. Elemental surfaces in combat are a very fun mechanic to work with. Races you pick in this game (Dwarf, Elf, Lizard, Human, and all the undead versions) all have unique abilities and tags unique to the races.  Cons: You can be thrown into a fight you don't expect (which can be also a pro depending on how you see it) Sometimes areas are high level to discourage you from going into them yet. This can get confusing when you don't know that there is another area with lower level enemies. You will use google at some point during this game. Some puzzles/ quests can be very difficult to figure out how to complete. Quicksave often, sometimes you might accidentally steal an item you didn't mean to if you click the wrong thing when moving. Devs, please just remove taunt entirely or change it. It's only one fight in the entire game so far that I've had to deal with this, but watching my character taken over by ai for a turn or two and using every scroll and source ability in my inventory is not an enjoyable game mechanic. Especially since it now pierces armor.  Overall, this is a great game that I would encourage you to give a try. It has some negatives, but they are definitely worth dealing with for the insane amount of positives the game has. The game has really good devs who seem to want to deliver a quality product, which they have. Out of all the RPGs I've tried, this is the best in my opinion."

[Moon]Frosti,100,19,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,119.8,"it feels really overwhelming, in terms of 'wtf am i supposed to skill/ go/ do', but once you are comfortable with the basics, its really fun and you are able to enjoy the setting.  A con though is that the difficulties isnt mere: More/Less HP or dmg, but the enemies changing their whole attack pattern. F.e. In tactician(hard) mode we hade a fight where they bursted our group in the first round with tons of elemental combos, when in Classic(normal) mode the same enemy encounter on the same level didnt use any element even once in the whole fight.  Feeling whise its going from 'Naked in a Snowstorm' to 'Idle on a Caribbean Beach'. Thats only from Hard to Normal, cant imagine the Very Hard mode.  I assume that even on Classic mode it gets a bit harder as the game continues, concidering my review takes place in the starting area.

Kaaros Aleri,331,13,4,"March 29, 2017",Recommended,189.3,"Short Version: The game is fudgin awsome, and in my opinion lives up to the Original Sin (hehe), Dialogue is better, Combat is slightly different but still just as fun, though the attributes still needs work and ballancing, the drop in multiplayer sucks massive Cysealean Fish gonads because of the almost non-existant host controls and no in-game voice chat that i could find, though in organized play can probably be the most awesome experience in the game because of the awesome saves that can happen with you and your friends. I rate the game a 9/10 with the multiplayer a 5/10.  This review will be mainly on singleplayer gameplay, of which i have player over 24 hours during the writing of this review and i will try not to spoil or touch the main story, quests and puzzles.           Gameplay 8.7/10                     The gameplay, much like it's predescessor, is a turn based RPG a la classic fallout and in my experience is much faster paced than fallout and Divinity: Original sin. The difference in gameplay from Divinity: Original sin is that the action system is more compact, some attributes were replaced to make things more simpler, defence from physical and magical attacks as secondary ""health"" bars instead of %reduced, a character past system that gives you new dialogue, and that the dreaded rock paper scissor persuasion system is gone. Many sees the changes as a double edges sword as it removes the more familiar aspects of the game, but to me it was very easy to learn which may have been the intent of the studio and you can take this as a negative or a positive.      Dialogue and persuasion system   10/10   Better than previous system in my opinion  The player dialogue changes i very much appreciated, especially the removed rock paper scissor system, the character past dialogue is interesting and suprisingly incredibly useful as you can get minor help from NPCs, an example would be ""MINOR SPOILER""  in the cave there is a lizard who sells physical weapons, armor, and spellbooks that will give you a minor discount for having the soldier tag  .      Combat Gameplay   9/10   It's different though not much better than the previous system in my opinion.  The gameplay and combat is still quite similar to it's predescessor, but much more fast paced and flashy, especially the new source magic though some of it can be underwhelming. Many of the combat changes seems to be based around the new magic and physical armor system, particularly the damage dealt within one round of combat seems to have been bumped up by a lot both NPC and playable characters compared to the older system.  The difficulty around the armor system can sometimes be glaring because magic, to me, is a much greater threat than physical attacks because of the almost ridiculous amounts of dangerous magical effects that enemies utilize like  poison, stun, fire, frozen, and curse  compared to the physical debilitations,  cripple, knockdown and in rare cases bleed  being the most dangerous physical ones. The good thing about the new system is that as long as you have the type of armor the effect/element affects the debilitation will only be applied when that armor bar is fully depleted, though some can see this as a negative since i actually liked the willpower/bodybuilding system.  Physical combat is still a very good way to do focused damage on one particular enemy, but is more devastating on one with little to no physical armor as  a well placed  barrage of arrows and melee hits can dispatch those enemies very quickly, though the same can't be said for monsters fighting against the playable characters unless the players are underleveled, but a proper and well built team can still kill enemies 3 levels higher than them.      Attribute changes   7/10   Simplifying things doesn't mean better, this is a good example. Worse than the previous system but is still okay in my opinion. The attribute changes to me are weird, like dr seuss weird, wits being too good with it affecting initiative and perception, constitution does not affect anything other than health, memory not affecting anything other than amount of spells (in my opinion it should affect some dialogue or something out of combat), and intelligence, having the same problem with memory only affecting combat and spells with no change in dialogue or out of combat stuff, strength is still heavily affecting combat very useful for throwing and lifting stuff and other out of combat stuff but is still overtaken by telekenessis, finesse only seems to affect combat and theivery, all in all the attribute changes are pretty wonky compared to the previous game.     Multiplayer   Drop in 3.1/10  oh boy.    Organized 10/10  I've not played organized multiplayer but i can see it being incredibly fun. I've only played multiplayer once and it was drop in multiplayer, and first impressions are the most important especially for new players. There are very little controls for the host of the game, for a game based heavily based on teamwork and tactics there is no voice chat from what i can find, the kick function does not work properly because a player can just rejoin particularly trolls and greifers. A help bar and proper command console/tab for hosts can help tremendously, adding a function that ban players from the server, and an option for local voice chat can help drop in play by a lot.  "

Marius,161,10,0,August 3,Recommended,270.2,"This game was amazing. The complex combat kept pulling me back to it. The story was immersive. I am writing this review to warn you about the end. The game is amazing until you get to the end. The game all of a sudden wants to throw weird puzzle mechanics that just don't fit with the flow of the game. They are also really annoying. Some boss fights don't follow the combat mechanics but yet your party does. The bosses do like 10 things at once and get back all of their AP (action points) on their next turn. If you played it on lone wolf, then you are able to do it too, but reccommended for advance players. My last warning before you buy this beautiful game is that the game still has bugs in it. There are many quest that can glitch out resulting in you not getting the xp or the award for completing the quest. There is a large list of them and you can google them when the time comes. I only had the one quest bug on me when i played through the game. Others had at least 10 + quest bug out for them. Worth it to the very end."

Brian (The Schmaltzy Cynic),893,16,10,"October 19, 2017",Recommended,179.3,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is the making of legends in modern games: A fully-voiced acted, superbly written 40-50 hour journey, tailored for both single-player or four-player local/online cooperation, with as much reasons for replayability to shape the narrative and to bite further into its sense of challenge as the amount of genuine affection and RPG craftmanship made into this one game. When you feature dynamic instrument options for battle music in a character creator and even after a hundred hours you still have more to learn and to explore in the world, you know you have stumbled across a game unlike no other.   This is also ignoring the extra features made for the community to expand the life of DOS2 with a Pen & Paper style mode, Game Master, and a dev-kit of modding tools to create your own adventures that harkens back to the glory days of Neverwinter Nights. There is simply too much care crafted into the soul of this game that it is simply impossible not to fall in love with it, even if the gameplay can pull some cheap punches for challenge leftover from the previous title. At its worst, DOS2 can be so mired by its hurdles that it makes the pursuit even more tempting to overcome. Unlike the original, this diamond in the rough illuminates all traces of imperfection the more you become lost in its brilliance.  It’s Not What You Say That Counts; It’s What You Do Before I begin to address the issues, the writing techniques of DOS2 need to be given their praise. Unlike the original which made itself into a buddy comedy experience to a fault for its abundance of comedy and non-cooperative dialogue, DOS2 keeps some of the buddy chatter for only multiplayer and the game focuses more on second-person dialogue to create the amount of choices and role-playing opportunities. Instead of creating lines for every character in every scenario, the dialogue creates the illusion of what you want to say and how you say it by smartly giving you options written as commands.   If you are not sure what I mean, then think of the situation this way: The writers can write as much options as they need to convey all available options without having to take into consideration of the character’s tone. Instead of writing out a angered, elated, depressed, etc. response, the narrator only has to give you options like a choose-your-own adventure book. (Ex. *Assume you know what he is blabbering on about.*) This method adds far more role-playing options without breaking immersion of your character, and it adds far more vivid choices that can affect the moment.  Even if you prefer a character with all voice-acted lines, DOS2 also offers Origin characters which are the companions of the game that you can play with their own backstories and voice-actors. You still can make choices but the character is more grounded than custom ones, and unlike the original the companions or players you tag along with have a greater sense of companionship because of this dialogue system and the story being focused on deciding whether to stick together or to divide amongst yourselves. This is a beautiful system that caters to all preferences in RPGs that does not weaken the storytelling nor the role-playing of the game, and it’s a system I hope more RPGs include this method to save money on voice-acting every single line.     Call Me Unreliable… Well, I’m None Too Clever; I Just Adore You Now let’s discuss the biggest issue with DOS2 that stems from the original, the seemingly unpredictable difficulty until you learn the game from the inside out. After nearing 200 hours, starting from Explorer and reaching the modded Infernal Difficulty, my experience has become a well-rounded experience, and this statement is still true. This is why I think it’s important to revisit this section to delve into the discussion once more.  Compared to the first game, DOS2 has a more creative approach to difficulty than rigid standards of what it defines as challenge. It is by no means an easier game than the first as Fort Joy is the first major obstacle to overcome due to resource scarcity and the importance of synergy with your builds; however, there are modifiers to enhance the challenge to suit the player. These things include making undead characters who can only heal by poison, which isn’t as much of a problem as it sounds as you can make interesting undead teams, straying from traditional party set-ups like having no main healer, or by adding more/less characters to the experience. (The ironic twist is that a two-man Lone Wolf party is MORE capable than a seven-man team on the same difficulty.) All of these modifiers are creative means for players to create a game as difficult as they want and still retain its sense of balance.  This balance is largely the result of all the new changes to combat. For starters, the armor system is completely reworked into physical and magic armor, which helps divide enemies by targeting their weaker armor. This also prevents stun-lock skills like battering ram to be abused without removing all the physical armor. As a result, it’s more important to make every party member have decent equipment and weapons—which in a strange way makes adding more companions more difficult with less good armor to go around—as enemies often will use area-of-effect attacks to weaken your party.   Second, the environment has more usefulness in combat. One simple change is the addition of elevation scaling that can add/lower damage based on who has the higher ground. Archers gain stupidly insane damage scaling as a result of this feature which makes them the most worthwhile member on the team. Elemental effects remain as potent, but the magic armor helps negate their damage spiraling out of control. UI problems like line of sight are no longer an issue as hitboxes have proper sizes as I never made one mistake in my decisions. However, certain elements like curse are often annoying because if you cast Bless on a pit of fire to remove them it should heal your party, but it will damage them instead; you have to cast it again, a limited resource, to make it heal them.  As a result of these features, the inventiveness and fluidity of combat never becomes stale, which only rewards players more incentive to play around with its systems and its immersive storytelling features that the Infinity Engine games always aspired to be. Whenever I think I have discovered everything, even 150 hours into the game, I manage to discover something new. This beauty itself is forever stuck in my mind after deciding to restart the game again because I wondered if two undead can romance—if a game can tantalize you back with a simple, “What if…?,"" then this game is truly something special.   An Ocean of Content with 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea Aside from those issues, the game is phenomenal any way you look at it as an RPG. The role-playing itself sets new boundaries and standards for all RPGs, single-player or cooperative. The sense of freedom and cooperation is leagues better than it was previously. Even the story itself handles its comedic elements far better with its grit that the darker moments are never too far away from a chuckle to lighten the mood. Lastly, modders will be able to take all the lessons learned from its community and Larian Studios themselves to create a thriving landscape of future potential for this game and the future of Divinity.  Whether or not you are familiar with the Divinity series, DOS2 is great on its own merits. However, a lot of meaning will be lost if you do not know the series’ history as it takes place 1,000 years after the original (four years after Beyond Divinity.) This is not a criticism but something praiseworthy that describes DOS2 as a whole; it’s a game with 20,000 leagues of depth beneath the sea and an ocean of content that spans across the horizon. This is a journey that will make you crave more adventure."
Whyzard,576,13,1,"October 25, 2016",Recommended,69.0,"I played this game for only 15 hours, however, I would gladly replay the campaign with friends, or fight them in the Arena mode. Only the first Act is out for now, and despite that, even if I did not even do every available quest, I spent 15 hours on this game. That part of the campaign also happens to have good replayability, because every quest can be finished in a diverse number of ways. The gameplay, while lacking some polish and balance (not too long ago some skills were seriously overpowered), is impressive and looks like it's only going to get better. The story and the characters are well written, and endearing. The game managed to make me care about characters that I only met in one quest, which is indicative of its overall quality. In conclusion, despite the current version of the game being short, it is brilliant and shows a lot of promise. I applaud the people at Larian for their work, and I trust them to make this the awesome game I know it can be. Of course, you should only buy it in its current state if you want to support the developpers, as, in its current state, it is not worth 45€ I will update my review as soon as that changes, however.  EDIT: Well, the game is out now, and boy, I wasn't disappointed. The two new playable characters, Fane and Beast, are every bit as interesting as the other ones, and bring their own little story line too.  Many skills were added while others were re-balanced, mod support is here, and it seems that it can do absolutely amazing stuff, Game-Master Mode is pretty intuitive and easy to handle with a bit of practice, and combined with mod support, I think it's going to allow for a wide range of adventures and campaigns to be designed by aspiring GMs. Overall, while the UI can be clunky at times, it is well designed. I'm especially impressed by how Larian pulled off the controller controls and UI, it requires a bit of getting used to, but it works great. Local Coop is great too, and it means that you can more easily play with friends that could not necesaarily have bought the game. Overall, a fantastic game, that I recommend without hesitation."

I hate all the animals in this game I start the game on a ship at sea, after a couple of pop-ups to get started I notice a sheep in a pin. Sheep are adorable so of course I want to pet the sheep, right? I tell her she's so cute and fluffy I wish I could pet her forever and I ask if can have a tiny piece of her wool. ""What?! A piece of my wool? It's bad enough I'm stuck on this boat, now you want to cut a b%$#h?!""   I can take a hint, so I keep walking and see a dog. Doggo! Doggo's are always cool so this must be where the game tells you that you can have a pet, I can't wait to get... ""I will bite you directly in your @$$."" Uh, don't you mean 'on' my... ""I said WTF I meant!!!"" I'm starting to think I should not have taken the ability to speak to animals.  Before any other animals can make me feel like crap, the ship is attacked. I run outside and there are MASSIVE Kraken tentacles wrapped around the hull trying to snap the ship in half. I do not know what the Kraken was so angry about, I didn't ask because I watch anime and I know a set-up when I see one.   Most of the crew gets washed up on the shore of a penal colony. I sit on the beach and think about how lucky I am, poking the sand with a stick, and a little crab scuttles by. Hello little crab. ""How DARE you address me, puny miserable flesh-stick! I am the most powerful sorcerer IN THE WORLD, I will banish you to the depths of the void with the click of my claw! Your soul will burn in endless agony! You will rue the day you crossed....""

I try to learn to fit in, get on with life, but I got in trouble and was thrown into prison which is odd since this is already a penal colony, so I guess this is technically super-jail? Anyway, I do find an escape tunnel but it's inhabited by giant fire-slugs. I try to sneak passed, but one of them catches me and demands to know what I'm doing. I'm trying to get the hell out of here. She says that's perfect and informs me that she is in fact royalty and in need of a messenger.

Personally to me feels very handcrafted instead of how alot of newer games tend to feel cut and pasted. PROS +game design- if you think through all situations and are willing to die a few times trying there are many different ways to complete any situation. +graphics- my pc is not grand(base alianware alpha I3 until i pay my house down and build my new pc this winter) and i run this game at 1440p high graphics and around 30 fps( never dipping below) +choice-i truely feel like i have a say at some parts of this game( hence i said someparts, this is very clsoe to a pen and paper but does fall short as will all games every played with any type of AI, it is just in the nature.) +difficulty- i know this has been a hot subject since alot of people are finding the game a little to difficult but it is my own opinion, i play on tactition mode, have 1.) undead poly, ranger. 2.)normal summoner lohse. 3.) normal rouge sibille. 4.) normal geo, warfare beast.  and i find the enocunters to be very difficult but i really enjoy a true challenge, as well as a challenge to know when i am out matched( does not happen often for most games now a days with all the monsters leveling with you. eg The Elder Scrolls Online, )i do enjoy that game too.)) +balance- while this is not a perfect positive i felt it worth noting. no game can be perfectly balenced but i feel as though my build setup(see note above) is far from perfect and yet i play on the hardest normal difficulty. and to me that is saying something, i did not feel like i had to play a certain way to enjoy the harder fights.  now for some of the bad i did notice.  -the number one thing i saw in this game that was missing... it is most likely something small to most but enemys and other npcs have things on their body that is not in their inventory. now i dont mind not having the armour and weapons, i would feel like i would be overwelmed with over powered things that would make me feel to powerfull( i dont enjoy that it gets boring, i like the fight just to stay in the fight.) but if i could use my rouge to sneak and replace a healing potion with a poison bottle, that would change the game for me. allow me to steal things( if i was tacticle about manuvering the land not to get caught.) that might hinder my teammates useless for fights. i just feel like that would be the cherry atop the already iced and sprinkled cake. -difficulty- i personally understand why alot of people dont like the way the game was made more (difficult) with it only being a stat buff to the enemys, and a rather drastic one at that, so i think there could be more difficulty modes, and take the one good thing from ark Survival evolved and add a slider for a custom difficulty( this is supposed to mimic a pen and paper like dnd give the players the choice.   there are more pros and cons to this game, but these were the ones i felt i would want to know about if i were trying to decide on buying this or not.  for me this game is a solid 10/10 there is room for improvment in any game but give credit where it is do. this game deserves it, it is rather a amazing title.  P.S. this is one of the maybe 4-7 games i have bought non-steamsale. i do not regret it at all and would very much recomend it to single player or multiplayer. thank you for reading this far and i hope this review helped you make a decision.( ask any questions you guys may have and i will do my best to answer!)  EDIT*  one more thing that I thought of that I personally feel should be fixed, as far as combat goes I don't mind the stat buff or the enemy having shorter cool down for skills then you do.  with that said the game should not allow an enemy to have free range of sight, what I mean is I have seen so many times that if I am in range but not within line of sight a enemy can hit you but not vice versa.  to me this is far from a game breaking bug. but it is the only way I feel gimped in any true way cause I cant truly have all power over placing my troops since ( in some cases) enemys could fire through that brush that I hid behind while shooting the other guy, with that said it also does not happen that often."

But I don't want to be tediously lengthy   because adding to the sea of praises for DOS2 is redundant. You search it up and you will find things everywhere like ""best pc game of 2017"", ""best RPG ever"", ""best game XXX've ever played"". They are all correct, and they have conviced many people to buy the game and share the amazing experience. But they haven't worked on you because you are still reading a nobody's review to decide whether this game is worth your money.   So I guess I have to write a bit more  You haven't played this game. Why? I get it. You saw some screenshots, watched some videos and probably you don't like some elements of the game. It's nothing like what you've played before, and you thought well it's not your type, doesn't suit your taste. I know, people are way too individualized. But, what defines your taste? Youtubers? Streamers? Friends? Game Studios? No. It's yours. A true gamer never stops exploring. Every once in a while you need to step out of your comfort zone and try something different. Yes, from what you've learned about this game, your prejudices are probably 100% accurate, but if you haven't tried it, please don't believe you won't like it.   If you've had the patience to read thus far, stir up a bit of courage and buy this game. Just sit back, empty your mind, and DOS2 will expand it, then blow it up into pieces.   If for some stupid reason you are still reluctant to try this game, it would be such a painful loss, a shame and a pity for both me and you. Because then apparently I have failed to convince you, and you would have missed the oppourtunity to enjoy hundreds of hours of divine entertainment that you could never obtain by other means.

My only problems for the first game were (1) character customization and (2) the lighthearted nature of the story.    Well, so far, Original Sin 2 has fixed those problems with a jackhammer.  I mean the customization isn't perfect, but it is leagues improved from the last game.  And the tags are awesome.  As for the nature of the story, it is much more grimdark.  Plus, with the tags, you can already tell there will be tons of replayability.    The game is beautiful.  And it's scary to know that this game is going to get so much better.

Rhuzkii,243,29,2,"October 1, 2016",Recommended,394.9,"This game is incredible! I can't tell you though which game of the series is better, seeing that they are both AMAZING!  I just wanted to give some feedback on the things I personally think are too overpowered. So I played as a elf warrior, and your race ability as elf is that you get 1 AP and + 25% dmg for some constitution. Then as a warrior you have enrage, which gives you 100% crit, and you can choose a talent called ""War Lord"" which enables you to get 2 AP back when you execute an enemy. With Warrior having 3 charges (Blitz Attack, Battering Ram and Phoenix Dive) which only cost 1 AP and Crippling Blow and Whirlwind as AoE you can easily solo pretty much everything. Those things in combination with the golden double handed axe you can buy from an NPC not that far into Fort Joy's story line you are just way too powerful compared to everything else. I mean pretty much all I did with Lohse and Sebille was relocating enemies using Teleportation and then just utterly demolishing everyone with my warrior. Red Prince was basically only there for the extra cc, allthough I found out that stacking physical armour on him and giving him Bracus' Helm and letting him learn Overpower is incredibly powerful aswell, seeing that he can shatter enemies' physical armour in an instance, making them an easy target for chain ccing them. So that was the part about warrior being too powerful, now I wanted to move to the part where I REALLY like the idea of two different types of armour (physical and magical) and them protecting you from negative status effects, BUT on the other hand it's just way too easy to abuse this mechanic into chain ccing everything, making the fights not really challenging at all. So in the end I wanted to say: Don't get me wrong, I really REALLY like the game and I was soooo frustrated when I cleared the first act that I had to wait until the actual release of the game, but I personally found those things that I listed too powerfull."

I've been burned by alot of Early Access titles before but I'm really happy to say Divinty: Original Sin 2 blew me away.  In terms of gameplay the combat was just the right amount of difficult (classic difficulty) so that I had to really think about my actions and not just go on auto pilot and auto attack, but not too difficult that I had to read guides on how to beat a certain boss or encounter. The puzzles and quests were engaging enough that I didn't blow through them and forget about them, but not too complex or long that I was completing them simply for the sake of moving on.  There were a few bugs such as certain skills failing to registering but seeing as this is an Early Access game I'm not too worried (In 19 hours of gameplay skills only failed to land 3 times).   If you enjoy RPGs you'll love this game. I'm not a big fan of turnbased games, I simply get bored because I feel no connection to the characters in top down turnbased games, but, like Xcom: EW and XCom2, DoS2 seemed to make all my concerns about turn based games fade. I truly felt invested in the characters and felt like I was in the middle of the action, cheering when my glass cannon rogue pulls off an insanely reckless but satisfying attack. The game truly elicited some genuine reactions from me. I got upset when my mage stupidly pulled aggro and laughed when a massively armored knight failed to land a killing blow on me because he slipped on some blood. It engaged me better than some AAA First person RPGs did.    The story was well written for the first act, and leaves you hungry for more. The NPCs are enjoyable to interact with and the relationships they have with the PC and his party actually make sense.♥♥♥♥♥♥a trader off enough he/she will stop trading. Steal from someone, you have to return the goods and get back in his good will before talking to him again.   The graphics are nice and the UI and controls aren't annoying. The AI is smart and for the most part doesn't get in your way. You just have to watch out for the sight lines of hostiles. The AI party members tend to stick very closely to the PC but if you're trying to squeeze past a narrow space they may accidentally walk into hostile sight lines triggering a fight. That's a very nity-picky problem that can easily be solved by watching out for your party better.  The freedom that this game gives you in actions and choices really is unparalleled.  I reccommend getting it now and enjoying it, but even if you wait I believe every RPG fan who wants to really feel immersion should get this game. Get it now, or get it later it doesn't matter so long as you get the game. You won't regret it."
Miyokari,971,9,0,"October 21, 2017",Recommended,179.0,"After finishing the game (took me around 105 hours on classic mode while playing on MP with my friend) I have to admit the game is great. Going from soundtrack, to gameplay, and the story.  Soundtrack : The music in the game is really good, the orchestral OST really makes the game, many locations and fight have fitting music for what they are. It's good to listen to the game OST even outside the game or use it in Roleplay sessions, I cannot add anything more to be honest... The soundtrack is truly great.  Gameplay : The gameplay is really good, I love turn-based combat in games and it is very refined combat from the first game. You can use envinronment in your advantage, set up poison and during the combat light it on fire, set up barrles of oil and poison ready to be destroyed and many more things which I really love about the combat. The gameplay itself is very nice, camera movement is nice and you can move it around however you want, the dialogue menu is pretty good. My only gripe was inventory but it's because it was mess thanks to my own fault (but auto sort button is pretty nice)  Story : It's good, great, awesome. The dialogues are very well written, the NPCs are ""alive"", it feels like they are real people, the talking with animals and them giving you quests is great addition to the game. Companions are also well written making it like you are adventuring actually with real people, with their own problems, agendas, interrupting talks sometimes to add something of their own. The game had as well really interesting plot twists in some places.

Especially the adition of Physical and Magical Armor. -Likeable Companions with their own story. -Better Graphics, Effects and animations (compared to D:OS1) -Overall better Combat system (but some small annoyances) -Loads Of content (Took me about 100 hours to finish the game) -Great Soundtrack -Improvements on unique playstyles (Playing undead etc)  The Bad: -The story. Even though betetr than the story of D:OS and even though it is passable it wasn't that interesting to me. Occasionally the side story fo the companion characters were much more interesting to me. -There are still bugs(e.g. Even though i choos e a different ending i got another one->won't go into detail so i won't spoil a thing) -Small annoyances in combat: Source Point system wasn't going really anywhere for me. Should have been refined.; Some enemies have annoying abilities: Cursed Wardens/Necrofire........ -At the last chapter some of the quests are knda tedious. Sometimes more is less.   Anyhow, all in all one of my most favourite RPGs of all time I think.  Let's hope Divinity 3 will be even better.  p.s.:If you liked the D:OS series you could always go back and try Divine Divinity (Diablo like 2d game) or Divinity 2 Director's Cut(Gothic/Risen kinda game with skills and dragon transformation.) Both are great games in their own rights."

First turn-based RPG I've played and each fight was really interesting, a bit like chess because you had to carefully use your turns or the game would kick your sweet patootie.  The biggest weakness for me was the game didn't seem to keep up with the changing context eg you may have completed a mission in a particular way and characters in the game would still be talking to you about it as if you hadn't done it yet.  This is probably because the game provides so much freedom that the devs couldn't possibly predict what every player might choose in every instance.  The final fight was a bit of a fizzer - I befriended the main villains so that they helped me fight the prime villain - so that ended him relatively quickly and then it was pretty much over - I didn't even have to kill the rest of them.

If you have ever enjoyed any parts of any role-playing or party-scale strategy game, buy D:OS2; you won't regret it!  I'm stoked for the final release, and who knows, maybe they'll even do a full EE for this one (or maybe they'll just drop the full, voice-acted, massive epic on us all at once, in a surprise on release day; because that's just how awesome this team is!)."
Rizzit,76,17,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,242.2,"This is a 230 Hours review on Tactician.   TLDR: This game is 10/10 and deserves a spot in the RPG Hall of Fame. IT is a must buy hands down.  Pros:  - Story: Amazing Introduction that ramps up to a very good confusing mid game meltdown and ends in emotional chaos. - Gameplay: Top Notch, skills, spells, interactions, AI, everything feels smooth and fights never get boring. - Length: You dont know when the game is finally over it is soooo long and thats a good thing - Difficulty: On Tactician the game starts absolutely brutal, towards the end it unfortunately becomes easier except a few exceptions who are crazy hard again.   Cons:  - Merchants: 1 Hour waiting to get a chance of new piece of gear, no gear leveling with you, lots of unique armors or weapons capped at level 18. You can fix this though by using mods but then you get no achievements. It's not noticeable until the very end but then you notice it very hardly, to the point you go afk for 1 hour to get some new gear.  - Skills: Some skills felt lacking, especially the source skills resolve into 2-3 being better then all the others which makes you feel pidgeon holed since the enemies on harder diffs are going to spam you with the good stuff. Some skills npc's use cant be learned... also you cant make true new classes in the SDK currently which is a big downer  - Story: I understand that with so many choices it gets more complex to keep track of everything, sometimes the game does not explain or give you a chance on understanding why a character in the story would do something. One example would be Gareth if you chose to destroy everyone but side with him always, he still will be opposing you at the end while not explaining why so yeah thats unfortunately not the only story let downs.  - Thievery: only 1 pickpocket per NPC per character this is ridiculous by the astronomical prices you have to pay and the minimal gold you get for selling stuff.

Enzevil,393,14,2,June 23,Recommended,117.5,"It was about time I write a review about Divinity: Original Sin 2. Let me start off with this: it's one of the best RPGs I've ever played, and this game ended up in my personal top 10 favorite games of all time. So if you're curious about why it's so good, read on!  Divinity: Original Sin 2 starts off with the choice to create your own character, or to pick one of the Origin characters. Origin characters are full fledged characters with a personal background, but you can still choose how you want to play them. These Origin characters can be your party members throughout the game, so I found it more insteresting to have my main character be self made.  The game really has a tabletop RPG (like Dungeons & Dragons) feel to it. You can really choose how you want to play. In most games, if you want to be a Jack of all Trades, you're a master of none. In this game, you're a master of all. Because the more skills you combine, the better results you get. For example, if you choose to be a Sorcerer, you can combine water with lightning or with ice. If you first use a water spell, the ice or lightning spell will have a greater effect on the enemy. You will be well rewarded for creativity.  It also has a tactical turn-based combat system. Even movement and placement is key in combat, as well as your (combination of) skills of course. It can take a little while to get used to, but damn, the combat is awesome. It's not like other normal turn-based game, where you obviously have a best skill to use every turn. It really requires tactical thinking, and it feels really rewarding if your plan worked in combat.  The roleplaying aspect is wonderful. Not everything has to be solved my combat. There are always multiple ways to solve things, even in side quests. Not only does your background matter, but also your race. Every background and race have multiple and different roleplaying options, even for the Origin characters, who also have unique dialouge options. Oh, and yes, there are romance options in the game as well.  The goal is to become a God, literally, but the biggest accomplishment is the journey. Yes, this sounds cliche, but you will really feel this after completing this game. Are you satisfied with the choices you made, to become a God? Maybe you can't even become a God, because of the choices you made. After completing this game, it really made me think twice about the choices I made in my journey and it's really magnificent if a game can do that for me.  I'm really grateful for completing this game. It was a wonderful experience and it has so much to offer, even compared to other modern RPGs nowadays. I really recommend this game if you like RPGs or games with tactical combat. Also worth noting: Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition will launch in August and is free for all owners of this game. So even if you're waiting for the that, get this one now and you'll receive the Definitive Edition later, for free!"

Jaycoß,262,11,0,"September 8, 2017",Recommended,406.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2  is everything the first game was but better and more. There's more options character wise (many different races), more possible outcomes of events and your decisions, more spellls, more everything!      The story is quite interesting, because this time around it seems to be more serious, dark and characters you meet (especially your companions) have their own unique storylines and motives which make you want to learn more about them, understand their POVs and interact with them (very reminiscent of the legendary Baldur's Gate games). After beating Act 1 I'm absolutely hooked and cannot help but wonder how their stories might unfold and what suprises await along the way.  UPDATE: The full game has come out and just as I expected it's bloody brilliant. Made it past the zone from early acces and there's so much to do, so much content that it's overwhelming. Best RPG ever!!!     The combat is more satisfying and rewarding than ever. It encourages creative thinking and approach to your encounters, as well as using the environment to your advantage. There's new spells and spell schools, including summoning and polymorph as well as many additions and positive changes to the old ones. The turn based battles feel a lot more fluid and engaging thanks to many mobility options characters got (grow wings and fly away, charge at your enemies or jump back - there's always an option). And of course You have the option to play the campaign with a buddy or a random person online. There's also a game master, dnd like mode coming which looks very promising. Exploration and experimenting with crafting and such is very rewarding and satisfying.    The audio is stunning, with a remarkable main theme chorus music that I cannot help but to hum to myself as  I wait for full release! Game let's you pick a favorite out of 4 instuments (oud, tamborine, bansuri and cello) the sounds of which get mixed in battle music as well as pivotal moments in your campaign, crafting a really memorable experience.     As far as graphics go they definitely feel like an improvement. Especially the character models and the armor design are gorgeous, where in the first game characters felt small and rather generic looking, with not many visual changes affecting them along the way, this time around each character and race look unique, feel big, present and meaningful in the game's world. Landscapes are beautiful and monsters you encounter look nasty (in a good way) and threatening.   Overall, I am very VERY impressed with what I experienced in the game and absolutely cannot reccommend this game enough. You can really tell the game was made with love, passion and care. (A very rare thing to find in modern games). This is, I swear the best RPG I've ever played."

Ultima Virus,337,19,1,October 5,Recommended,91.7,One of the best co-op RPG games ever made.
Mr.Yellow,566,16,6,"January 11, 2017",Recommended,201.4,"It's short and very much unfinished thus far, and yet has utterly surprised me by being one of the most fun co-op experiences I've had in a while. While it has some issues, for Early Access it has a level of polish unheard of in most games that aren't yet fully released (and also some that are).  The systems seem well thought out, 4 player multiplayer is a massive improvement, the game looks quite lovely not even just in raw graphics but more importanly in visual design, playing as the Red Prince and picking the most Vegeta like dialogue just to see what happens is funny to me, the combat is fun and just challenging enough, these are all good points in the game's favour.  But. There is but one thing that draws me in like a moth to a flame. I have never seen such levels of freedom and sandbox design in a fantasy RPG before to the extent where there's just so much room for player dickery. For example, my friend would start conversations with NPC's like some kind of Strangey McWeirdo who actually wants to advance the plot instead of committing petty crimes for even pettier reasons (I know right?). So, while he's talking, learning story and lore, and just generally enjoying the writing I decided to ♥♥♥♥ him over for a laugh.  Even outside of combat you can sneak as long as you don't enter an NPC's Line of sight, and the NPC's sight was focused on my poor friend and not her valuables and I. Needless to say I made off with her shoes, a potion, and some fish the last of which i sent to my friend's inventory as they were still talking. One (what I can only assume to be magical) cavity search later and my friend was in prison while I was grabbing many, many, crates all of which sell for 1 gold to get my pants back after a guard took them from me the last time I got busted for petty theft.  10/10 Would have a kleptomaniac episode again."

Plays like the first, but with a lot more to do in battles, around the world and interacting with NPCs and your party. Theres that same humor that the last game had, so youll still find those flavor items and people in the world. The graphics are beautiful and the world looks vibrant and captivating. The writing is as good, if not better then DSO, with an added narrator and voices with every NPC.

I could only wish all game releases were this way, so rich and full, without extra fluffs or DLC's hiding bits and pieces of it away.  About the only thing I could fault this for is not letting have the campaign assets for the GM mode, I want The Lady Vengeance map for a campaign darnit!

Nexwolf | Shahr,196,8,0,"January 22, 2017",Recommended,118.4,"Recommended. Very Recommended. Please note though: - Currently in early access. This is fine for me but you are currently only able to access the first act. There are plenty of bugs to be worked and features not yet added out as you would expect from an early access pre-beta release. That said, though, the first act is A+++  D:OS 2 is a  turn based RPG based on gear, skill points and abilities, elements etc. A strategic game for sure. This was exactly the sort of game I was looking for and expecting as I was a huge fan of the original.  This game manages to capture what made the original great and expand on it in so many ways, with the ability depth, more grim story and great style (even when running on a potato).  There are plenty of features still to be implimented (such as local coop) as one would expect from an early access release. That said, however, you can be at ease as this is a company that has illustrated clearly in the past that they deliver big time on any promises made during the development period.   Overall, if you're looking for a strategic, turn based RPG look no further."
Pixlow,305,44,19,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,244.5,"Paid some pimp in a tavern a 100 gold for a prostitude. Went up to the prostitude and had a long good talk about how she should actually be paying me for it, then said ""Now that we have established who is the most desireable here, i will take my leave"". She got mad and said i couldn't get a refund. Little did she know that i already had stolen my money back from her pimp.   10/10 Would steal from pimps and ♥♥♥♥ with prostitudes again.   But in all honesty the game is great, the story is much easier to follow now that it is voice acted in my personal opinion. Upon reaching Reaper's Coast i have experianced some slight problems with perfomance, but other than that, the game has been going smoothly.   The turn based combat gets spiced up by the ground effects, you can either make great use of those mechanics or they can be your doom. Saving before battle is recommended. When combat gets challenging there is no shame in reloading a save to come up with new strategies to defeat your foe. Running from combat might also be the smartest move in some situations.  The origin characters give a nice dynamic to the singleplayer game, having them in your party leads to some memorable events between you and them. When you interract with an npc they have interrest in, they will let you know, you can either allow them to do their buisness or keep them away. This will lead to you bonding with that character. If they do something you do not like, you can often have a talk about it afterwards.  The music in the game is pretty good, but sometimes there is some mishaps where a piece of music that is out place plays. Nothing gamebreaking, but you can lose a bit of your immersion. You are able to pick 1 of 4 instruments when you make a character, you will hear these instruments being played in the level up music and etc.  Persuasion checks have been a little confusing for me, sometimes when i believe i definantly should be able to pass the skill check for an option i fail and other times where i think i should have failed, i passed. No idea if it is randomized or how it works."

jimbobslimbob,243,10,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,128.1,"It's a turn-based isometric RPG which attempts to do what Sword Coast Legends never did: make a computer game that captured the essence of PnP, complete with campaign editor (not tried yet, since this is an EA review), GM mode and true RPG-freedom-of-choice. It is very similar to RPG's of old, like Neverwinter Nights, Baldurs Gate etc.  I have only completed Act 1 so far, since that's all that exists in the early access version, but I am hooked. The game is a joy to play. Difficult at times, yet rewarding too. It offers true freedom of choice in the way you play and create your character. It features a classless character system so you are free to do whatever you want with your character. It also features various ""origin"" characters which are kind of pre-generated characters with fleshed out backgrounds (the kind of thing you do yourself in a D&D campaign). You can choose to play one of those or alternatively make up your own and recruit them in game.  There are many ways to solve the quests in game, offering a lot of replay value. Race, ""tags"" (such as Outlaw etc.) all make NPC's treat you differently and offer various other ways to do things. The co-op gameplay (up to 4 players) has also been specifically designed with this in mind, meaning your party may not always see eye-to-eye on things. This creates the potential for some interesting RP scenarios.  Although the version I played does not yet feature a GM mode or level editor, this looks to be the icing on the cake and could significantly increase play-time. They will also offer Steam Workshop support for ""click-and-play"" modding.  Now all they need to do is offer the ability to import/export characters...  Summary Overwhelming to begin with, but once you get to grips with the game mechanics you realise just how well crafted this game is. Gorgeous graphics, wonderful sound and music, solid turn-based tactical combat and endless replay value.  Jimbo Rating: 8/10 "
Avigoat,9,15,1,August 5,Recommended,85.9,I would compare this game to the show death note where the first half is absolutley amazing but the second half is lackluster. The first half of the game in driftwood there are so many quests and things to do each quest just as interesting as the last with an immersive city that feels like its lived in but then in the second half when your're on the 3rd island idk what happened  it lost its magic with an island where all you do is pray infront of stones and there are no other quests than the one main storyline. When you reach arx after that very dissapointing island it gets a bit better there are some quests to do other than the main story and they are interesting as well. The combat through the entire game is great. Good progression to feel like your character is truly ready to become divine and if you play this game with a friend it is a great experience that for me kept me wanting to play this game till the end. This game is definitly worth the first 40 hours to immerse yourself in the world however the 3rd and 4th island of the game falls short to the rest.

Zurv,860,7,0,"October 16, 2017",Recommended,153.7,"This game is fantastic. One of the best RPGs I’ve played.  Larian created a rich and living world to play in. The story (unlike the DOS1) is good with twists and turns. There are tons of side quest and normally multi ways to finish them. (yes, murdering everyone is an option… but then you might miss out on more story/exp.) The interaction of “systems” they setup, from how elements react with other elements/spells to actions in the world people see you do. It makes for great combat and a lot of creative way how to deal with enemy/issues. I did play the first game (Divinity Original Sin) so I had an idea of how the game worked. (side note, there is no reason to play the first game. While great, it task soooo long to get going that many players will bounce off it.) I didn’t find the game or it’s systems confusing because of that.. maybe? Do not expect the game to tell you explicitly how to play. It isn’t “hardcore” that you need to just work it out yourself. It will subttlely tell you how to play via the interface. My advice is take it slow. This is one of those games that you search everyone, read everything, talk to everyone.  Save a lot. (f5 key) Not because it is hard, but you might change to change how some event is going once you see what is happening. Honestly my biggest “problem” with the game is a massive fear that I’m going to miss something. (which you can totally do.. it is very easy.) Did I miss some book? I did not ask the right question? Did I have a skill to low and missed seeing some hidden item/switch/etc… argh! That said, there is so much here it isn’t a big deal to miss some side stuff. But.. but.. I want to see it all.. so.. there is some stress there. Getting to the last big area was very stressful for me as I started to feel overwhilemd  The quest log isn’t super great. It isn’t always clear what the next steps are… but in the defense of the game it really isn’t a check list of this but more a log of what you are doing. (but it would still be nice if they said if X quest is going to end of it leave area Y or if it will keep going.)  Totally get this magical game, but do expect to bump into a learning curve if you’ve not play RPGs before. (of course there is an “explorer” (or something like that) which might be a way to get into the game a little ez’r.) There is co-op in the game too.. but I personally don’t see how that would be fun. Each person in your party is a part of your strategy. Well, at least play with someone you know and not a rando. )  Most people will restart the game after a few hours after they get an idea how the party they want and rolls/skills they want. But don’t super stress it. After you leave the first island you’ll be able to re-roll all you people skills/stats/etc (and as any times as you want.. free. The game isn’t setup to screw you over if you made a bad choice.  "

Xilil,57,14,0,"September 16, 2016",Recommended,127.9,"Everything that made Original Sin 1 is in here, plus loads of extras that add to the experience.  Character development now allows for much more flexibility. In OS1 it was pretty hard to make some original combos like a battlemage because of the way skills and attributes worked. Now it feels like characters are much more customizable to whatever crazy combination you want to have.  The graphics are also a huge improvement. The PBR-rendering makes everything look stunning while preserving the nice aesthetics of the first game.  The single player Act that is available to Early Acces offers a lot of content. The replayability is also quite high. There are quite a lot of ways to complete your goals, which will make every playthrough a bit different.   The only problem that I think this sequel still has, is that sometimes it's hard to find the content for your level. Because of this you sometimes end up just running around looking for those level 4's you still need to kill to level up.   I thought PvP was going to be kind of nice, but that is quite the understatement. The PvP is one of the best PvP experiences I had in a long time. There's so much depth to it, while still keeping it fun. This is were the additions in combat from Original Sin 1 really show their beauty with Source skills and tons of new surface combo's like blessed fire. I just hope there will be a matchmaking system eventually because the server browser isn't that good in my opinion. People try to put up private matches in public, so everytime someone joins they instantly kick them.  Which brings me to my last complaint, which is that the game visibility of single player is the same as the visibility of multiplayer. This means that if you want to play single player, and right after that create an arena lobby, you have to change the setting every single time.  In conclusion I think it still has its flaws which is normal ofcourse, but at its current state it is already a beautiful and fun game."

Sgt. McSergeantface,85,9,1,July 4,Recommended,237.0,"Why exactly you are reading reviews for Divinity: Original Sin 2? I doubt you were just browsing store. You were looking for RPG, don’t you? Or maybe you’ve heard somewhere about this phenomenal game and just checking out. Or maybe you don’t actually trust this unstoppable hype train, do you?      TL; DR. Buy. Play. Replay. Get Enhanced for free. Replay.     Well, every praised thing you might have heard about this outstanding game is 100% true. My life is now divided into “before” and “after” Divinity: Original Sin 2.   Larian Studios - creators of Divinity - is company of people, that actually works with players and for players. I will remind you, it is an indie project financed on a crowdfunding platform. Game has inherited all the best parts from previous instance. However, it is an understatement to tell that OS2 improved things. Sequel has added so much more, it has surpassed every existing game and doubled, tripled the level of today’s RPGs, adding everything we didn’t dare to dream about.   We want to choose playable races! - Ok, here’s four. And you can make a playable undead character. We want more companions! - Fine. And they are living humans - play with three of your friends.   We want more magic and perks! - Here 4 more skill schools and mix them up to unlock more perks. We want to make love to our party members! - No problem. You also can punch ‘em in a face anytime. We want personal quests! - Welcome playable characters with prewritten origins and their own story arc. We want more stories! - Here’s Game Master mode and dedicated modding support.   Everyone knows, how much time it takes sometimes to create your character: skills, abilities, talents, etc. Eventually it took me twice as much, because I just couldn’t stop admiring visual design of characters, feasting my eyes while scrolling different races and skill presets, to see as character’s model switches his looks. In addition to looks and technical part of your avatar, there are two notable things in character creation. First, if you build your own character (not pre-created), you can add some personality traits, which together with race will reflect on your social interactions (i.e. dialog options). Second, choose one of four musical instruments - game’s musical score will dynamically change leading instrument, when your character does something awesome. Imagine epic cello or bansuri solo when your hero is unleashing some hell on pity enemies! More to this: do not bother with perfect build, try fresh ideas, experiments and bold choices - Divinity will allow you to change your specs midgame numerous times if you think you’ve messed up.   Combat system maybe the one thing that has changed heavily in sequel, a lot of things were reconsidered. For me personally it was hard to get used to changes right after first game, but in hours I’ve found it even more satisfying. However, keep in mind that straightforward face punching still not the option. Tactics has moved into third dimension - do not underestimate high ground. And of course, don’t forget to utilize everything you can reach, that’s including you pockets and your surroundings. Found yourself standing fenced in a fire - use water barrel to extinguish it or bless fire and stand your fight in cleansing flames. Got bullied by a brute - teleport yourself out, or teleport enemy’s sorry♥♥♥♥♥on lava. Some of most efficient tactics are those that not first come to mind.   Plot isn’t connected to Original Sin. Sequel is provided with its own overarching narrative and several personal story arcs of origin characters (which also serve as companions) and particular factions. Everything is interconnected in some complicated manner, it was the reason of bugs and some general frustration, because one path leads to impasse on other story thread (fixed by further patching). However, game doesn’t hold your hand and never questions your approach to advance the story. E.g., first thing you are tasked with after tutorial section - get out of concentration camp, and then you can look for someone to help you with this, help others for info on how to get out, murder your way out, lie your way out, or fly away, if you have the ability, without even meeting anyone. Plot progression is not just 3-4 options, but absolutely non-linear. Basically, you can roam where the wind blows the whole game, you will always find yourself on a right path.   World of Rivellon has changed. At first, after whole shiny hunky-dory previous game, it was tough to find yourself in a place that is harsh, cruel and mean as Wild West. People will lie to you, use you, and you absolutely will find yourself in a situation, where the line between good and evil is blurred into wide grey area, where all alignments are subjective. Look, I have lost the faith in what I had been doing halfway through and have to reconsider my view on things - it is impressive storytelling for a video game.   Music in game is kept on astonishing level, with memorable scores and even few actual songs, that are closely tied to game’s narrative. Soundtrack is notably adaptative to surroundings and players interactions. Thousands of lines of dialogs were voiced perfectly, with distinct accents and proper manners respective to in-game personalities. Surprising addition is in-game Narrator, that makes you journey more immersive and closer to tabletop gaming. Narrator’s commentary on things are so neat and detailed, you can basically enjoy your ride with eyes closed.   Persuasion, as a vital part in RPG gameplay, has changed. Creators ditched that awkward “rock, paper, scissors” minigame, though there is no any kind of randomizer behind now. However, success not solely depends on your persuasion skill level: very neat thing is involving physical attributes into check, like trying to reason with someone adds your intelligence bonus, while intimidating is much easier with high strength.   Most of the game earlier criticism was based on overabundance of bugs, inconsistencies and even script deadlocks. However, Larian never stopped patching and fixing and up all holes and mistakes, therefore every month after release players received long lists of patch notes. As for now most of things are shiny, polished and perfectly balanced. Moreso, Larian is readying an Enhanced Edition for release, where everything is refined and glossy, and with reworked third and fourth chapters of the story, which got their fair share of judgement from players. No point of waiting for release, as owners of current version will receive a new one.   Divinity OS2 requires your time and energy investment. There is so much in this phenomenal game, you are not able to treat it as a casual walk in a park. Managing characters party, inventory and crafting, diving deep into each story, heck, even most of the important combat encounters are challenging and will take a lot more time that you think, with all the tactical possibilities. However, if you are ready to enter immense world of fantasy, magic, political intrigue, adventure, love and betrayal - there is no better way than playing Divinity: Original Sin 2."

A Catgirl is Fine Too,394,20,2,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,108.5,"The first Original Sin game was my favorite title of 2014, and I have been impatiently waiting for the sequel from the moment I finished it. I am pleased to report that it has been well worth the wait. Larian Studios have a fundamental understanding of what makes a good sequel: Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps the things that made the original great, and builds on the areas that were lacking.   The art design is even more stunning than before, and the one act currently available is packed with things to do. I've already found numerous clever ways to solve both major and minor quests. Combat, arguably the most important aspect of the game, has remained largely the same, with the addition of new mechanics such as height and cursed surfaces to keep things fresh. The plot in the first game was one of my few complaints, as it felt generic and poorly paced in places. However, in Original Sin 2 I find myself much more intrigued and very much like what I have seen of the story so far. Although the game is still in early access as I write this, it already feels like a straight upgrade from Original Sin 1.  As far as criticism goes, the music currently feels slightly lackluster, although being able to choose a special instrument to play during climactic moments is a novel idea. One of my complaints from the first game was that by the end of it, combat had begun to feel tedious. As I said, combat is still fundamentally the same, but I have yet to explore all the new features and I hope they keep combat exciting across my multiple inevitable playthroughs.   Of course, as an early access title, bugs and glitches come with the territory, but I have yet to experience a game-breaking one. I am currently playing on ultra on a moderately powerful laptop, and performance has been stable, with an average FPS of 60-65.   In conclusion, did you like Divinity: Original Sin? If yes, you'll love this one too. If for some reason you didn't, you're not going to find a completely new experience here, although it might have fixed what you disliked. If you're new to the franchise, I'd always suggest buying the finished first game over the unfinished early access game, but if you're a fan of turn-based RPGs you'll likely get more than your money's worth. I have a huge amount of respect for Larian Studios and I don't doubt for a second that Divinity: Original Sin 2 will only get better from here. "
axfelix,267,13,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,113.0,"Man, it's so good. They took what was already the most flexible, fun, and modern CRPG out there and made the engine even more expansive and the game weirder and more interesting.  I would actually recommend playing the first one first if you haven't; it's not really needed for plot reasons (there are a few returning characters but nothing major) but it's a little easier to get a handle on, hardly any less impressive, and in the meantime this sequel could probably still use another few months of polish patches. It's hardly anything to hold against it given the scope, and I didn't hit a single bug I'd consider really significant, but the farther you get into the game the more broken the quest flags start to feel and the more minor continuity issues the dialogue starts to have and the more combat balance starts to break. This is all after like 30+ hours, mind you (I'm up to 50 and not quite done yet, which is unheard of for me)."

On that note, play the first game first, it's great, and if you like it then come to this one. The two big notes I have about this game are that it's dumb you can freely respec, and tactician mode is a major dissapointment compared to tactician mode in the first game. It's predominantly just an enemy stat buff (+50% to damage, vitality, and armor) and that's about it. It's most just artificial difficulty for if you played the game through a few times and want to have it challenge you again.  Overall I like it a lot, but I admit I don't quite love it like I did the first game."
Dralek,315,6,1,"October 6, 2017",Recommended,294.2,"This game is amazing.  I can't stop playing it.  Let's start out with the first thing you do in the game; character customization.  You have 4 races to choose from, each with their own unique traits, backstory, and affect how everyone treats you.  Lizards can dig without a shovel, Dwarves can crawl into small spaces nobody else can, Elves can eat body parts to learn the memories of the fallen (sometimes gaining skills in the process), and so forth.  You've got a lot of choices for playstyles as well, and it's not set in stone.  You could start off the game as a wizard, then transition into a battlemage who charges into the fray, then unleashes spells that require proximity.  Then, you've got the Tags.  Basically, they let you set up your own backstory, as well as giving additional dialogue options when the time is right.  Mystics can sometimes talk to the gods, whilst Barbarians want a *simple* solution to many problems.  But the best is yet to come...  and it's something that I'm a bit of a sucker for.  Music.  You can set the lead instrument on the soundtrack.  It's only four instruments, and the one you choose will be, well, the prominent instrument throughout the soundtrack.  Not a fan of character customization?  That's fine, you can select an Origin character.  These guys normally would be optional party members if you were to create your own character, but you can also play as them for your main character.  The choices are really interesting too; a lizard who cavorted with demons and got exiled, wanting to reclaim his empire; or a human who is a host of all kinds of spirits while a demon is trying to wrest control of her body.  They all have pre-set tags, but you can choose the class they start with.  Now for the gameplay.  Out of battle, stuff is simple; everything is performed from your clicking (duh).  However, even outside of combat your skills are still tested.  Persuasion can be a way to get out of a fight, or get more information out of someone, bartering lowers prices for you.  You can also steal stuff too, but be warned if you played the first game; the stealing has been revamped by quite a lot.  You can no longer just walk into someone's house, close the door and sneak about, stealing everything that isn't bolted down.  The moment you take something, no matter if you're sneaking or not, the townsfolk will become suspicious and try to search you.  Of course, there's ways to make sure they don't succeed, but I'll leave that since a lot of this game is about finding your own playstyle.  The combat is not really changed by much from the first game, but many more complexities have been added.  Surfaces play a crucial role to a mage just like before, however they have many more options due to the magic trees.  Water can be frozen, electrified, or turned into steam which can also be electrified.  Bless can actually turn surfaces, well, blessed, healing characters who travel through it.  (That includes everyone, so make sure blessed surfaces can't be accessed by the enemy.)  However, there is also Cursed surfaces, which carry extra effects to them.  Necrofire can't be put out by normal water, Cursed Oil can go off on MOVEMENT, and so forth.  Armor is no longer a stat that simply decreases damage received, it is instead its own bar.  This bar is crucial to manage, as it stops status effects.  Think of it as a shield; as long as you have a shield up, you can't be affected by the status of a surface your character may be standing on, with certain exceptions as Oil that slows you down.  As a general rule of thumb however, the game's combat is very challenging.  There really isn't many fights that have ""cannon fodder"" enemies; everyone is dangerous and they all know how to take advantage of the same things you do.  Be careful about that water you're standing on, for that mage on higher ground likely might have an electric spell he could cast, if your magic armor is down, and stun you.  My recommendation?  This game deserves all the praise that it's got and more.  The only real complaint I have is with the camera control, but that's mainly due to my mouse having issues with some games not registering the middle mouse click.  Plus, in battle you can get a top-down view if there's too many obstacles."

Dogg,196,6,0,"November 18, 2017",Recommended,110.3,"**spoiler free**  What a fantastic journey. Every once in a while, you get incredibly hyped for that next game that's about to come out... and every so often, that very game delivers on the hype. This game ultimately did that for me, and I'm almost sad that the journey is now over (unless I start another new game). Starting each category at 10 points.   Visuals: starting at +10 ================ The game's graphics look fantastic. There is a vast amount of polished detail in each and every environment. The developers didn't leave anything out. Even areas you may only explore once, if only for a couple of minutes, got all the same polished details as areas that you'll be spending hours upon hours inside of. Brilliant, long, hard work went into sewing the fields of this game's visuals, and the developers are reaping the fantastic benefits of that hard work. Well done.  + No real cons here. I never had any screen tearing and rarely saw any seams throughout the world.  Final score: 10/10    Sound/Music: +10 ============= For anyone who has read my past reviews, you'll know I use the word ""weight"" a lot when it comes to sound effects. This ""weight"" means that for each and every major sound effect in the game, there should typically be some kind of ""impact"" behind them. It doesn't have to be a big ""boom"" for that to work. It can be the sounds of butterfly wings flapping in the wind (which would be incredibly hard to hear), or it can be a loud thunderbolt. Either way, whichever object or environment a sound effect has been stuck in/onto, it has to have a strong feeling behind it. This is not easy to explain, but let's just say that Divinity Original Sin 2 pulls it off extremely well.  + All abilities sound effects, even ones that are as simple as throwing a dagger, feel heavy. There is strength behind them. No ability is left out, nothing is in the ""filler"" category. Excellent.  + Music appears to be orchestra, and it's great. Battle music pumps you up. ""Majestic"" music calms you down, and provides a sense of relief behind it. It all sounds fantastic.  + Pre-final battle music setup is excellent (only those who've played the game will understand).  + Great voice work across all characters, both major and minor.  Final score: 10/10    Performance: +10 ============= Overall, the game runs well.   + When everything is working, it performs at 60 FPS, constantly.  +/- Long long load times between regions. I mark this as neither a plus or a minus due to the fact that once you're loaded in, there are no load times whatsoever. The game loads everything upon entry (this is why is takes so long).  - Bugs bugs and more bugs. Nothing game breaking fortunately. A common theme when it comes to Larian Studios games. The good news is, most bugs are extremely minor. Quest bugs WILL be contracted, inhibiting you from actually completing a quest. Other quest related bugs include 1) actually completing a quest, but it never leaving your quest log. 2) you have option A and option B to choose from. You chose option A, but the game will say you chose option B. -1  - Certain battles have frustrating situations where a turn will not end immediately, forcing you to wait for up to 5-10 minutes at a time for each turn to finally end (even though nothing is happening). This will hopefully be patched in the near future. It was not patched in this playthrough. -1  - Game will crash every now and then. -1  - Strange lag issues in regards to certain spells (such as blood storm). These lag issues will persist until the specific spell (or spells) animations have completely ended, sometimes several turns after being cast. -1  Final score: 6/10   Story: +10 ======== You are a source wielder. You've been captured and you're about to sent to what would closely resemble a ""prison island"" to serve out your remaining days. It's time to escape! This is where the adventure begins.  + Premade characters all have an actual personality that you will love or hate. It will slowly be fleshed out as the story progresses, whether for better or for worse. Whichever character you pick (or don't pick, you can make your own too) will still have their main story attached, but you get to make a plethora of extra decisions behind them that will ultimately influence their endgame personality. So don't be afraid to pick the premades (you can also edit their classes and appearances).  + Relevant in-game choices that will affect the endings.  + Special endings for certain characters are available.  - Some scenes would have a far greater impact if it wasn't simply reading text. A few animations here and there wouldn't hurt, especially behind big scenes (that would normally be a cutscene vs an interactable scene). -1  Final score: 9/10    Gameplay: +10 =========== Gameplay hinges upon building your starting character with either physical, magical, or ranged damage types (ranged being both physical and magical, depending on if you're an archer or a mage). You'll run around and collect lots of loot, sell the loot, buy better loot; craft items, scrolls, and potions; learn a vast amount of abilities and even craft secret ""hidden"" abilities; there is plenty to do here, and you will be busy, all while having fun (hopefully).  + Respec any time once you hit Act 2, for free. This will actually probably enrage some players, because they want to feel the weight of locking in their choice of permenant abilities (i.e. Diablo 2). Respecing for me on the other hand was the greatest thing to ever happen in this game. I started as a Battlemage, switched to a full time mage, and then later switched to a mostly full-timer tank/DPS with certain mage support abilities attached. I had another character start as a full healer and supporter, who later stayed as a full healer supporter, but also had fire and ice abilities to help in combat, if they couldn't do anything else. You can experiment to your heart's delight. So get past Act 1, then indulge in the world of change!  + You can play as a skeleton, with facial hair.  + Various unique abilities for each race are well implemented and can provide extra benefits to playing a certain class with a certain race (such as a thief/assassin with an undead, due to getting a free skeleton key to unlock any chest provided you have high enough Thievery skill. No need to buy lockpicks!)  + Crowd control in this game is just as fantastic as it was in the first game, with a vast amount of new CC abilities (like sleeping).  + The addition of Armor and Magic Armor is also fantastic, providing you with protection against CC abilities of both the physical and magical aspects until that chosen armor is depleted (unless you have Glass Cannon).  + Playing with friends is a lot of fun.  +/- Some talents in the game feel wholly useless (Demon and Ice King), while others feel overpowered. I mark this as plus or minus simply because you can respec at any given time. It would only benefit to take certain ""less useful"" talents to quick specific areas of the game, then respec again back to whatever you were originally with. That being said...  - I played the game on Tactician mode (which is basically hard mode) and having a slightly higher fire resistance or slightly lower ice resistance never really made that big of a difference. The enemies in this mode having such incredibly strong physical or magical abilities would typically negate your armor too too quickly, and 15% out of 100% is just not very helpful. Leadership was a much better option, and also freed up the ""wasted"" talent points. These less useful abilites are what you would call ""filler"". -1  Final score: 9/10    Overall: 8.8/10 (44/50 = 0.88) ===================== A well delivered fine wine that will age almost indefinitely for days to come. Will sip on again. Great job to the developers."

I tried the arena mode out and it is actually really fun! I then proceeded to the campaign with a friend of mine and was overwhelmed with the character screen for a alpha game.. I created a elf Necromancer.. I will eat everybody's corpse and steal their souls... That is what i love about this game, you can kill every single person in the game and still complete the story.. Well this game you (kind of) tell your own story, each race has it's own dialogue, each trait has it's own dialogue (bandit,rogue,scholar, that kind of stuff) and already for a alpha game seems almost finished!

Marcus Butthurticus,"1,198",8,0,May 2,Recommended,170.9,"This game is really a master piece in the RPG genre in modern times.  Simply put it is a charming game with wonderful enviroment in a world that is deeper than one might think. It takes silly bit to far at times but never as far as lets say Borderlands 2 did which to me, ruined the whole game. Original Sin 2 is both a silly and grim story. The turnbased combat is excellent and it works so well with others. Prepare for a lot of backstabs if you play with nasty people! And prepare for twists.   There is not a better multiplayer RPG this side of Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2. The builds you can do are plenty and races bring their own special abilities, especially Elf and Undead have some unique mechanics, like eating body parts to gain memories of the dead and even abilities at times or Undead....being Undead.   There is at times some weird things. Like AI going nuts and doing not so optimal things or certain questlines not working correctly. RPGs with long questlines that the player sometimes managed to screw up by circumventing things by being cheesy is a classic thing in RPGs, The more advanced endings and options for a questline, the more keen to it breaking it is.   Beside these problems, Original Sin 2 is a excellent game, with nice character building, this is probably one of the strongest parts of the game! Just going nuts when it comes to builds. NPCs that are not so bad, Interesting characters and a developed world. Only thing I would want is a longer end act. The last settlement you are in could been a bit bigger to symbolize the size of it. For the next  game I hope to more of the same, even if it has to be crazy AI and questlines that is not always triggered in the correct way. I hope to see a Original Sin 3 in the coming years.  EDIT: I must point out that the issues could all stem from us taking breaks over a month at times which could off have broken things between patches. The game usually works very well otherwise."
Fork_Q2,"1,616",8,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,215.2,"Amazing and extremely reactive RPG. Many ways to discover new quests, and many more ways to solve them, rewards creativity and thinking outside the box. Immersive and interesting plot, world might be bright and colourful, but the plot and side-quest can be extremely dark, touching on topics like genocide and child murder. On the downside, there are some balancing issues, UI could be much improved, a fair bit of wrong or placeholder text and content showing up later in the game, and a few bugs. But otherwise a rewarding experience that I want to immidately return to again, after beating for the first time. And I rarely play the same game more than once."
Dhr. Bernard,413,21,20,"September 16, 2016",Recommended,18.7,"Tbh not owning this game is the original sin  All nonsense aside though, I really like this game.  Although there is only one chapter available at this time, there is a big island to explore with hidden secrets like treasure and hidden caves. The combat is deep and has a nice tactical twist to it and definitely feels more smooth compared to the first game.  However, before buying this, keep in mind that this game is still in early access for at least half a year. So there is no voice acting yet, some sound effects will be missing, you might encounter quite a few bugs and glitches and most important of all, there is only one chapter available at this time (you still get 8-15 hours of gameplay from this, plus there is an online pvp arena).  If you don't mind the lack of content and if you are a fan of a bit more slow-paced rpg, this game is definitely something for you."

I can see myself putting 50+ hours in the campaign and then many more in the gamemaster mode  -anytime I clear any default keybinds and leave empty they are binded to the default again next time I play -map markers will stay after objective is completed  -the journal sometimes lacks important information that you'd expect in a quest log (similar to the first game) -trading with characters can sometimes be annoying when you can't access party members items -Early game enemies have much better armor and abilities  Overall a fantastic game that has few flaws.

It's not an overly-complex isometric RPG like Baldur's Gate but it achieves the same level of good storytelling and flexible paths of completion.  This game truly demonstrates the next generation of top-down RPG's and you're missing out until you've finished this.  It will take you hours just to get out of Fort Joy, and by that time you'll think the game is half over, but there is still so, so much more content after.  10/10, its just too damn good.

I don't know how to rate this game appropriately. I love it, but it has some weaknesses which I am not sure what to associate with (e.g. game design versus just alpha stuff).  Game is smooth as soft butter. Runs great, plays great.  For developers: Change the frequency of cat meows. OMG irritating with surround sound every 10 secs hearing the freaken cat.  For players: Buy it early. I never bought a game early on steam. I loved the first one, watched some youtube videos on the development of the second and decided to buy early to support the team.   If you are looking for a turn based game this is your game. I will just leave it at that and edit my review as I play more.

TheokolesTW,97,12,3,"September 16, 2016",Recommended,76.9,"The worst aspect of playing this in Early Access is that even though you're getting to play the game - you still have to wait until they release the final, finished version.  It's going to be tough to wait it out. Because now I know just how good it will be.  The game plays much like the first - just better. It's design, the more polished and tweaked systems. I've been playing with a friend who is new to the series and honestly I laugh when I tell him about some of the systems in place.  ""Yeah so you can teleport that bad guy and drop him on that bad guy and they'll both get hurt.""  Or  ""Right, did you pick up that corpse's leg? Oh, well pick it up and we'll take it to an Elf so they can eat and tell us where to go next.""  Or  ""I'm not sure what to do, we might want to talk to that cat.""  Lol.  Playing this game by yourself is great - playing with another person, or better in a larger group... man this game is gold.   I've still got a lot of play left in this game - but I dread finishing it and having to wait for the rest. So I'm taking my time. If I can spend a couple of extra hours where someone else would take only 1 I'll be a happy bunny.  Anyways, if you like this sort of game (and honestly who wouldn't?) do yourself a favour and pick this up for you and a friend. Just remember to come into it with the knowledge you're going to have to wait until next year for the full thing."

LugdunonTG,744,16,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,91.7,I loved Divinity: Original Sin both in Co-op and Single player. The first time I played it was that same feeling in D&D when you realise you can do nearly anything. Divinity: Original Sin 2 carries on this legacy incredibly well already considering it's early state. In the short time I've played I met a host of weird and interesting characters. Stumbled upon various quests that aren't just in plain site.  This is the way I love my RPG's this game rewards you for exploring and taking risks. Just because the odds seem against you does not mean they are as long as you use the environment to your advantage. Blood puddles on the floor can become electrified to shock people on them. You can contaminate them to poison people and use fire to cause poison to combust. It's a wonderful game that I feel like will improve on the original in every way once it's finished. The early version does contain bugs and is obviously missing many aspects but if you wanna just mess around with builds or the new PvP modes then now is as good a time to jump in as any as long as you realise its not fully fleshed out YET. High recommendation from me for all RPG fans.   https://youtu.be/LxvdYIl1IMI  Here's some Gameplay if you wish to see more and I may consider making this a series with enough interest otherwise I check back every few updates.

There are discords dedicated to finding and hosting groups, no need to hope for a reply on the steam forums or join random groups in the browser. It's so much more enjoyable, but frustrating at the same time. Learn to love fort joy, as you'll be restarting many times. It took me good ~30 groups to find someone to finish the game with. Thankfully (and sadly) first act is the best made one, and there's a lot to do there.   Main reason why I would recommend this game is not it's story, or some innovative features and approaches, but it's replayability. Even 300+ hours in I found combat enjoyable, each fight a challenge, with a chance to ♥♥♥♥ up. There are some rather clever mechanics to learn and abuse, unique skills to master, builds to optimize and routes to find.   The game is well worth your money and time, despite it's shortcomings.   Speaking of which... Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of things wrong with the game. From expected (but not liked) bugs and glitches - on my last playthrough we had at least 3 bugged quests, a bunch of issues with stuck characters and desyncs - to more serious problems.   Story is passable at best. It will not keep you awake or amaze you in the end. Sidequests are often more engaging than the main plot line.   Armor system is very restricting for the most of the game, especially on the higher difficulties. It pretty much forces you in to using only physical or magical (typically physical) damage, as you need to strip the armor before controls can be used, and controls are mandatory for the most of the game. Yes, sure eventually you can get one spell room clearing mages, but that's late game, and that's not what you will be doing most of the time. Arguably mages are gimped up to level 12, which is a good half of the game. Once again, this is highest difficulty level, but this is where it gets fun.   There is also serious lack of skills, or variety, to be precise. It's fine for first game, but later you start to notice it more. And so many skills are very situational, or subpar, so you generally use ~5 constantly and a few for utility. It's specially notable between melee classes, as a rogue, knight(2h weapons), warrior(sword and board) and metamorph will use the same warfare skills, as they are core to being a melee, and not their ""subclass"" variations. There are also crafted skills, combining 2 schools, but combinations are between magical and physical schools, meaning you will rarely even see them.   There is very little to do outside of combat, except preparing for combat or picking up quests before you go fight stuff for the quests. A bit lacking from a cRPG.   Several of the systems feel unfinished, lacking purpose. Crafting seems like a huge part of the game initially, but you only really craft runes and lockpicks. Potions, scrolls, food and grenades quickly become useless, even healing potions are disappointing in the endgame. Scrolls hold up the longest, but not the offensive one, only the ones that can remove status effects. NPC attitude value is a glorified discount program.   AI ""cheats"" a lot. No one will suspect you as an undead (or having the zombie trait) outside of combat, but once initiated, get ready to receive all the healing spells. And they will forget it immediately after. Enemies will know where exactly to move, to avoid a minefield of line of sigh obstacles and smoke blockers, just to get that single possible shot on their turn.   But all of that said, I still enjoyed the hell out of my time with the game. Sure, maybe the abysmal state of PC gaming this year and lack of good RPG games in general is partially to blame, but I think there's more to it.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for a game they can immerse themselves in."

GeneralPing,189,5,0,"September 23, 2016",Recommended,25.1,"Divinity: Original Sin 2  If you are wondering whether or not to buy this at alpha please read  Pros: - The game is very polished for an alpha, more so than the completed Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition - There is up to 4 - player co-op which is magnificent - More interactions between characters with, arguably, a more riveting story-line (Only chapter 1 thus far) - Combat is more easy to follow, movements cost less AP and it is all around improved on - More customization options when compared to the original  - Multiple ways to complete tasks, it really feels like Larian Studios wants you to discover your own way to solve problems - Even for an Alpha Divinity: Original Sin 2 is better then most games out today  Cons:  - Lack of in-game voice chat makes playing with random people difficult as it usually devolves into murdering the entire town - It's still in Alpha, buy the game, support the creators! - If you don't know what to do or lose direction you may get bored, similar to the original, pay attention and read everything  Overall I'd say that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a big step up from the first. Graphically it's superior, it runs better, the combat is improved, the story is more engaging, players get to interact more, and much much more to come in the future when the game is fully released. That and this is a pseudo - follow up to the original game. So if you played the original then you will most definitely enjoy the tid bits of information and story in the second!"
Lavo,341,5,0,"October 11, 2016",Recommended,216.9,"After some time, I'm finally able to give my final thoughts.   Graphics: Animations and effects feels and looks smooth and polished. I love how the water and fire looks in this game. During co-op play with a friend of mine there were couple graphical bugs or glitches, but nothing major.  Characters: You can choose to play one of the six origin character, each with they own story or you can create your own custom character. Some NPCs may recognize your origin character as an old friend or someone they are hired to murder. This helps flesh out each origin character and it really makes you think how some encounters would have went with different character.  Combat: Characters can use all kinds of spells, skills or items to get out of tricky situation. Turn-based combat gives player(s) plenty of time to look around and make best use of their surroundings. Electrify water puddle (or create one if there is none) to stun enemies or freeze it to make them slip and knock themselves out. What I'm missing from Divinity: Original Sin is smoke cloud to block visibility from enemy rangers.   Also one major difference between Divinity: Original Sin and Divinity: Original Sin 2 combat is how to block / resist status conditions like fear, stunned etc. Instead of investing points to certain ability to increase your chance to resist getting stunned, in Divinity: Original Sin 2 you have physical and magical armor values, which block status conditions as long as corresponding armor value is higher than zero. I think this is a nice improvement.  Music and sound: Voice acted characters (player and npc) sounds great and hearing they saying their lines makes conversations feel lively. Sound of nature such as walking on sand, water or fire sounds life like and real. Add great music and you have one potion of eargasm. Love it!  Overall, I highly recommend any RPG fan to get this game or Divinity: Original Sin (Enhanced Edition) or maybe both."

However I must say this game has exceded all my expectations, and they were quite high to be honest.   Pros: - Fully customizable characters: stats, talents, skills, equipment... you can play whatever personalized hero you can think of. - Great graphics: it may not be high-end graphics, but are pretty good and would make the game playable in ultra spec in any computer - Deep story: I have only put 18 hours to the game and I haven't yet advanced outside the starting area. So many characters, so many stories and so many places to explore - Open world: go wherever you want, the game guides you in a very slight way allowing you to wander around as you may please - Decissions matter: every dialoge option will have an impact on the outcome of the conversation and the story. Every character has unique dialogue options with the same character, making the game deeper and more realistic.  - Turn-based Combat mechanics focused on tactics over clicking like nuts - Great soundtrack - Deep crafting mechanics - 360º camera + tactical view mode (top down)  Cons:  - Can be hard to get into. Lacks some more explanation of the mechanics at the beginning - If you missclick a talent or skill point you cannot take it back - Sometimes sound gets a bit laggy  For me this game is a must have. 10/10"

ReaperX30,309,13,1,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,14.0,"Having backed the first one on Kicksarter and owning it on PC and Xbox One, I was already sold on the sequel but even with it being an Alpha version at the moment it's already showing how great the final game will be. My PC can only handle it on Medium but it's still really pretty and run smooth. The first thing that will hit you though is how magical the soundtrack is. The people who did the music really knocked it out of the park.  One of the new feature is the Origin Story which is basically premade characters with independant questlines meaning that if you play with someone and you choose a different character than you'll have things to do that the other won't and the same for them. I'm not a big fan of fixed character but the story of the one I went with (Lohse) is pretty interesting so far. Even if you choose one of the Origin Stories you still can customize your character's hair, hair color, Skin color, facetype and class.  I haven't played a lot but I'm already hooked.

Lavo,341,5,0,"October 11, 2016",Recommended,216.9,"After some time, I'm finally able to give my final thoughts.   Graphics: Animations and effects feels and looks smooth and polished. I love how the water and fire looks in this game. During co-op play with a friend of mine there were couple graphical bugs or glitches, but nothing major.  Characters: You can choose to play one of the six origin character, each with they own story or you can create your own custom character. Some NPCs may recognize your origin character as an old friend or someone they are hired to murder. This helps flesh out each origin character and it really makes you think how some encounters would have went with different character.  Combat: Characters can use all kinds of spells, skills or items to get out of tricky situation. Turn-based combat gives player(s) plenty of time to look around and make best use of their surroundings. Electrify water puddle (or create one if there is none) to stun enemies or freeze it to make them slip and knock themselves out. What I'm missing from Divinity: Original Sin is smoke cloud to block visibility from enemy rangers.   Also one major difference between Divinity: Original Sin and Divinity: Original Sin 2 combat is how to block / resist status conditions like fear, stunned etc. Instead of investing points to certain ability to increase your chance to resist getting stunned, in Divinity: Original Sin 2 you have physical and magical armor values, which block status conditions as long as corresponding armor value is higher than zero. I think this is a nice improvement.  Music and sound: Voice acted characters (player and npc) sounds great and hearing they saying their lines makes conversations feel lively. Sound of nature such as walking on sand, water or fire sounds life like and real. Add great music and you have one potion of eargasm. Love it!  Overall, I highly recommend any RPG fan to get this game or Divinity: Original Sin (Enhanced Edition) or maybe both."

My PC can only handle it on Medium but it's still really pretty and run smooth. The first thing that will hit you though is how magical the soundtrack is. The people who did the music really knocked it out of the park.  One of the new feature is the Origin Story which is basically premade characters with independant questlines meaning that if you play with someone and you choose a different character than you'll have things to do that the other won't and the same for them. I'm not a big fan of fixed character but the story of the one I went with (Lohse) is pretty interesting so far.

Now before you say it was not perfect, let me say there is no such thing as perfection, we seek it and hopefully never find it. DOA was brilliant and that is a fact, not an opinion.  DOA2 well its ""more of the same"", and I know when people usually say that it is followed by a sigh and resignation and usually ""Uh"".  However not in the case of DOA2 it does all the DOA tick boxes but adds more, and I mean more in a very good way.  An example is when you start out in DOA2 you will find that crafting plays an important part of getting better equipment to survive.  There are even more ways to complete quests and some ways you can avoid quests, for example there are various ways to leave and some require a clever tongue others brute force or stealth and so much more.  The character backgrounds are an interesting and tease you with a more interesting and some quite meaningful motivation for escape and progression.  If this opening chapter is anything to go by then all I can say is ""more of the same"", YES PLEASE!...So put it on your wishlist or buy it."

Blackadar,366,6,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,115.9,"Almost copy/paste of the original DoS2 review, this has been updated for the new edition.  I could just about copy and paste my D:OS review for D:OS 2. The short versions is that if you liked D:OS you'll like 2. If you didn't enjoy the first you won't like the second. So if you have experience with the first title, there's your answer. You can stop reading now. The rest of this review is aimed at those who haven't played the first game.  I thought the first was a GOTY contender in 2014 and I think #2 is a GOTY contender in 2017. But it's going to get tougher to keep recommeding this series when the same bugs and flaws keep showing up. So let's start with those flaws.  1. The obscure quests still remain from the original and you often have no idea how to move a quest forward or where to go next. The quest log is still quite useless. Some quests are quite obscure looking for objects that you may have uncovered (or not) including at least one with an object from a prior area. 2. Some screens are too much of a pixel hunt and the highlight button doesn't highlight most objects.  3. The difficulty curve is, frankly, stupid. Larian still needs to tone down the difficulty on lower difficulty levels and smooth the curve. You will likely hit problems in the low teens and then the endgame battles are stupid difficult. 4,. BUGS. Larian still can't test out bugs for♥♥♥♥♥♥ For instance, I finally won the final battle...only to have the game keep me in combat meaning I had to do the whole frickin' thing all over again. I finally got through it again and the voice-over proceeded to give me the wrong ending. DAMN IT LARIAN, YOU HAD ONE JOB!  Now on to the good stuff.  Like the first game, this game has the best turn-based combat ever to appear in a RPG. This is the meat of the game and it's sooooo tasty. There are many options on how to approach a battle, so many builds and so many tactics that it's impossible to even scrape the surface in a review. Literally no other RPG gives you this kind of build and combat flexibility.  Every encounter is a combat puzzle and most of them are fun. Sometimes an encounter seems impossible and then you figure out a strategy to make it relatively easy. This series remains the high-water mark of RPG combat and you could play it many times with many different builds because they play so differently. The AI is quite good to the point of being frustrating. You can - and will - get stun locked in certain battles (frustrating!). As I said, this is the core of the game.   The rest of the game is good too, even if it doesn't quite measure up to the combat excellence. The back stories of the starting characters are great and your party members seem to be far more developed this time. The voice acting has been consistently great and the music and sounds are still top-notch. The environments are quite beautiful and quite detailed though they are sometimes so busy the game delves into a pixel hunt. The races are really quite neat and there's a couple here that are fairly original which isn't easy to do in an RPG. The RPG aspects just feel more fully fleshed out in this version. The synergy between the NPCs doesn't seem to be very good to start but after a few rough bumps the first two levels it's easier to figure out how you want to blend your party. Truthfully, I haven't seen much in the Dev Cut that I didn't recall from the original but I'm sure there's some new stuff.  DoS2 is a step forward from the original and both are excellent games. Recommended for any RPG fan."

The writing is a huge improvement, the voice acting is brilliant and the strategic combat is even better than before. The game is a blast solo or with a friend, tons of customization and many ways to go about doing missions. So many cool skills to play with it is amazing!  I have not been this addicted to a modern roleplaying game since Fallout New Vegas or The Witcher 3 (Sure I loved Divinity Original Sin 1, Dragon Age origins, Pillars Of Eternity,etc.. but these are on another level for me personally). Every aspect shines in this game and my biggest complaints are improved this go around. Larian deserves a ton of respect and love for making such a great, epic roleplaying game. This game has a ton of replay value and will played for many more hours for me.   Games of this quality don't come out that often, go support Larian and buy this wonderful game, get ready for some wonderful adventures! Hands down GOTY for me in 2017. I enjoyed alot of games this year but nothing game close to the total package Divinity Original Sin 2 offers. If you enjoyed Divinity original Sin 1, pick this up ASAP.  If you didn't like Original Sin 1, there is still a good chance you will fall in love with the sequel, as everything is improved.  Well done Larian, well done!  **Over 170 hours later, what a game! Not only one of the best rpgs of modern times but also ever. Just a real joy to play and you can tell the developers put a ton of effort into this game. Other rpg devs take notes! The game has the best turnbased combat, much improved writing, wonderful world design, tons of fun quests, it is very challenging (Dark Souls who?) and gorgeous art design. While it is great when playing solo, this game has some of the best coop with a friend (or a few) that I have ever witnessed, not just in rpgs but any genre, grab a friend and get ready for a really amazing ride. This is a perfect example for how to turn a good game's sequel into a much improved (in nearly every aspect) masterpiece**  **The Definitve Edition has come out and it is fantastic, what a wonderful job Larian does at giving us a free enhanced edition a year later. Last years GOTY just got better, somehow! I can't wait to see what Larian does next, they have been on fire lately!**"

Easily over 100 hours of adventure & exploring. Superfun and hard tactical turn-base combat that will force you to think about every move you make (every step you take, every bond you break.....you get it).  xD  The game can seem a bit unfair at certain boss fights and puzzles but you will get that DarkSouls feeling when you finally defeat them/solve them.  The freedom given in this game is beyond understaning how it's even working without being broken. (Not that it's not without bugs, but nothing to worry about too much)   There's just so MANY ways to complete a certain quests, so many MANY ways to play a class, sooo MAAAAANY spell combos and so many ways to play the game itself, it just offers a great amount of replayability and countless hours of fun.  I almost gave it a perfect score, but for some technical issues (f-ing necro fire lagging on a GTX 1080Ti!) and unnecessary difficult spikes I took one point out.

In this game you have: Marvelous Graphics An interesting and Compelling story Quality side content A combat system that rivals or surpasses XCOM Interesting characters that have actual story arcs and personality Beautiful Environments and an astonishing amount of content.  The only problem I've had thus far is that it feels like side content is almost required to stay properly leveled so you don't get ♥♥♥♥ed when you go to an area you are a tiny bit underleveled for.  Other than that it is easily worth the purchase price, especially if you are a fan of old CRPGs.  Also you need a mid or high range PC to run it well."
Rumbeef,"1,115",4,0,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,175.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game that had me constantly feeling as though I was getting to the point that I was powerful, and then they threw a curveball at me.  It kept me exploring and eating at the edges of quests that I would have to return to later when I was more experienced.  Throughout the game I came up to walls that I had to search for ways around or over, it seemed like the game was always ready for me.  It felt rewarding to figure out something, to get past an enemy who had stopped me before, to try something different with my skills and abilities.    I hadn’t played any Divinity games before and they had a good way of bringing me into the world they’ve crafted, individual party members had interesting motives and I felt like our interactions were dependant on my input.  The story had a good thread pulling me towards the conclusion of the game and kept me wondering where it was taking me.    I like turn based combat because it usually feels like I’m responsible for what happens throughout combat, and Divinity has a few ways to have unexpected actions unravel your plans.  The elemental system worked well for this, combining a few different spells could make a whole area a minefield, or clear it by using alternatives.  I didn’t utilize all the systems, other than a few items I never had to touch crafting and rarely used potions.  The items and loot were enough to have an impact on my builds and I was usually able to get gear I wanted from either quests or vendors.  There are enough abilities and types of play that I could see a second or third run being very different than how I played through the first time.  I only played a little multiplayer, but I enjoyed how we were able to work together to rob and murder people, something I can never bring myself to do when I play solo.  I think they found a good balance around doing turn based rpg combat with multiple people, if one person gets into a fight while their buddy is somewhere else, the buddy can regroup and join into already active combat.  That also works in the single player game as well, I often would start a conversation with an enemy and before combat started I’d organize my squad and summon a demon for backup.   I got completely addicted to this game when I picked it up, I was impressed by it the whole way through."

It's easy to get lost if you're not focused on progressing early on, but the middle and ending of the game hit the perfect balance between exploring a rich, interesting environment, and a desperate race to save the world.   the finest and most captivating story i've ever had the joy of experiencing. coming from the lengendary writers of Falluot: NV, and KOTOR 2, expect a breathtaking journey with twists, turns, mysteries, and shocking reveals that few games have ever come close to.  bring one friend your first time thorugh  absolutely phenomenal from start to finish, and worth re-playing all over again just to see more."

Excellent and noteworthy features: -Deep dialogue system with meaningful choices and consequences -Beautiful orchestral soundtrack -Undead feature implemented well into character customization -Split screen and online multiplayer/ co-op -Full controller support -Game Master mode for what is essentially in-engine D&D -80,000 lines of dialogue, fully voiced  The list goes on.

[AEON]Lockerd,565,4,1,"December 18, 2017",Recommended,196.8,"Ok, I wanted to do one playthrough before giving my opinion on the game.   That being said, my ONE playthrough...took me 195 hours...and I loved every damn 11,700 minutes of it. I got the game less than a week ago.   There is so much I haven't done, so much that I intend to do in my next playthrough with friends. I also haven't tried any mods, the game is apparently as close to open source as you can get and it's super moddable.   There are full dialogue options, numerous perspectives and angles to take. You can do so much in this game and it's filled with so much content, honestly puts many many games to shame...♥♥♥♥♥♥drenched shame.   My experience was as ""Malcador"" the undead necromancer polymorph battlemage who somehow also managed to keep people alive with minor side effects. I walked upon the sands to meet my companions, whom I would never part with. Beast, Red Prince, Ifan. We fought monsters, found our callings, and had kickass adventures.   In my darkest hour, with only myself remaining and surrounded by vicious enemies...I looked into my inventory and saw salvation...""Death Fog Barrel"" In that moment I knew what I had to do, I dropped the barrel and hit it hard, everything arround me was dead and there was much rejoicing. And that is how I defeated the chicken warriors of karrakdo'.  I cannot say anything to do the game justice, the only thing I can come close to is that this game has EARNED its right to be called the Game of the Year.  I'd go as far as to say that it deserves game of the decade."
Lazarus,238,4,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,253.3,"27 hours in the game and I haven't even left Fort Joy. Literally... I haven't broken out. I convinced my best friend to join me and we have been hacking away at anything and anyone who seemed like a bad guy. Breaking the game mechanics is legitamately half the fun here. We managed to sneak our way past Magisters by using the teleport spell. Somehow... we always managed to take the back door into every dungeon.   We couldn't stop getting ourselves in trouble at every turn. By the way, getting into trouble is just part of the fun. Speaking of which, be ready to quick save a ton. The developers were kind enough to give 5 quick save slots along with auto saves and unlimited hard saves... Unless you're playing on that insane 4th difficulty, in which you have just the 1 save and a total party kill is very very bad. You basically get your save erased on the hardest difficulty if everyone dies.   Pros: -Break the game dammit. Just do it! I swear finding ways to navigate and utterly cheese your way around a level is amazing. We saved a paladin just by teleporting everyone up to the second floor of the castle, then knock down the ladder, and then sneak to the front door... only to get prepared for a massive fight just before the doors swing open and  a Knight and Battle Mage just flat out turn into hulking battering rams that decimate the first guy they see. The amount of planning that you can make for a battle is amazing... I even got a chance to set up environmental hazards for the enemies by moving poison barrels and oil barrels ahead of a fight.   -The sneaking system is hilarious, but well maintained. Seeing a lizard tail poke out from under a barrel makes me giggle. The enemy vision scales down with higher thievery skills.  -The turn based fighting system is the best I have seen yet. It really feels like a ton of heart and effort has gone into this portion of the game. You need to see it to understand just how much it is like a legitamate DnD pen and paper style turn based system. It brings that niche genre to an immediate resurrection and breathes new life into it. Trust me, if you get this game for any reason, and you like turn based strategy, this is the very reason to get giddy like a damn school girl. The battle system alone is a game changer and was an insta buy for me and my friend.  -Choices, choices, choices. Choose wisely or shoot yourself in the foot... or shoot your friend in the foot... or shoot that annoying cat and feed it to the elf. I'm not joking, that cat is in the way all the time. I can't go 5 seconds without accidently lighting it on fire. The dialogue system is very well done and the choices you make will certainly matter. You can miss massive side quests that actually are very important to the overall story and your well being. Other mission and quests are just there to get your butt into a ton of trouble just because you said ""what's the worst that could happen?"". Everything... Just be careful with your choices. You may also live with any and every choice you make. Bad decisions can follow you and from the looks of it, can have consequences on the quests that get closed off because someone had a bad attitude with you or they got shanked unsuspectedly when you were looking the other direction. However, even bad decisions seem to lead down some interesting paths.   -Dialogue is absolutely amazing. Every character and NPC I have met so far is voiced and has a good feeling to their emotions. They always feel genuine, so far. I have yet to meet an NPC that had seemed overly annoying or out of place. The voice actors have done a really good job. My favorite part is the narrator, who has a soothing englishman's accent and doesn't feel snobby. Once again, props to the voice actors.  Neutral: -Have yet to experience the Game Master mode, yet the tutorial makes it out to be a true Dungeon Master style with 4 players under the control of the DM. You can make full campaigns and there are a literal sh*t ton of options. Just look up Game Master Tutorial on YouTube, which was made by the devs, and you'll see what I mean.  -If you don't pick one of the Main Characters, you may be missing out on massive parts of the story. Do not worry. If you create a custom character, you still have the option of taking 3 of the main characters along in your quests. Each main character has their own story and ambitions. Be sure to pay attention to them as they may lead you down some very interesting paths.  Cons: -I am legit am coming up short for things I do not like. There were some minor bugs when the game first released, but the devs seem to have a fast response time and are working diligently on most of the problems we were experiencing. In fact, most of the major issues disappeared on the first week. Sooooo... these are not the cons you are looking for..."

Many places to explore, many people to persue and many 'ventures to subdue. One of the most epic experiences so far delivered in a fantasy world, giving us more control on builds to make - be anything you want! Combine your summoning skills with your tanking approaches, making yourself a strong opponent to those who dare to face you. Many quests to complete; each one of them has a good start and its up to you entirely how you would like the result to be. Turn based combat mechanics, along with some events that occur during the fight turn tides for both of sides, watch for a third invader! A bit of a rushed character development at the start, but you will get the gist of each easily the more you interact with them, all of them provide many benefits and great moments to witness your character engaging. Play with friends, play in-character during dialogues that can make the options wider in terms of gameplay and character benefits.   One of the best RPG games I have played in a long time that keeps me sunk in for hours even days now! coming from a guy doing a singleplayer, it is astonishingly entertaining, and the encounters are very memorable.

AstroBoltos ✦,135,4,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,287.2,"One of the most immersive RPG's I have ever played, although it's only a part of Act I the world in Divinity feels ro rich in life and lore. Playing classic mode is just about right in terms of difficulty the turn based combat makes it super complex, it's both easy to understand but  hard to master. Combat is super tactical you will find yourself struggling to keep your party at bay fighting hordes of enemies. The enemy A.I. feels natural as if you where actually facing a big threat in the dungeons, but it balances out with how good you level up and build your party. There's a bunch of stuff you can do while in combat such as positioning and combining different elements to your advantage but it's still very fun and doesnt feel repetitive. The crafting gets a little confusing, dont know if it's because I haven't found many recipes but through combining you pretty much go blindly into it and expect to get soom goodies such as consumables and learn the recipe.  The decision making in this game is pretty much a big deal, since it signifcantly affects the people you interact with and the outcome of any conversation related to your actions or thoughts. For an early access game its 10 times better than any mediocre regurgitated unpolished garbage on steam.  The Core gameplay will be fighting and looting corpses to get stronger, but you will find yourself with a lot of quests from various NPC'S and sub-story lines. Although I felt a little insecure with how quests didnt show any markers on the map or minimap it is very immersive that while chatting with NPC'S they can pin point a location of interest in the quest if the person you're talking to actually knows about it, instead of just telling you to do something and you as a player just feel like you are going through rails while discovering quests.   The amount of time I spent reading and nitpicking through my journal and conversations was just about right, not too confusing but not too easy, the game really does a great job at treating you as a competent player. While its easy to get lost on objectives and questlines you can always go back to the conversations you've had with your journal. The Soundtrack is Amazing you wont even feel it bothering you when jogging or fighting through the maps various and diverse locations.   Overall I said everything I had to although, I had encountered various bugs but nothing a good checkpoint cant fix and I cannot wait for the full realease. A very good experience for a fan of the genre. I think most people should have a fun time, but its far better when playing with your friends and having a blast. Interactivity with the world and the attention to detail that Larian studios has made is superb, trully a nice gem to be found. I strongly recommend you get this game if you are into gaming in general."

Gears are  varied and shows great detail when equipped.  Good replayability as there are plenty of classes to choose from and you won't always get same results as your previous playthrough.  I restarted couple times and few missions i had different result but can't pinpoint why.  If you loved the first, this is a no brainer."

Lazarus,238,4,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,253.3,"27 hours in the game and I haven't even left Fort Joy. Literally... I haven't broken out. I convinced my best friend to join me and we have been hacking away at anything and anyone who seemed like a bad guy. Breaking the game mechanics is legitamately half the fun here. We managed to sneak our way past Magisters by using the teleport spell. Somehow... we always managed to take the back door into every dungeon.   We couldn't stop getting ourselves in trouble at every turn. By the way, getting into trouble is just part of the fun. Speaking of which, be ready to quick save a ton. The developers were kind enough to give 5 quick save slots along with auto saves and unlimited hard saves... Unless you're playing on that insane 4th difficulty, in which you have just the 1 save and a total party kill is very very bad. You basically get your save erased on the hardest difficulty if everyone dies.   Pros: -Break the game dammit. Just do it! I swear finding ways to navigate and utterly cheese your way around a level is amazing. We saved a paladin just by teleporting everyone up to the second floor of the castle, then knock down the ladder, and then sneak to the front door... only to get prepared for a massive fight just before the doors swing open and  a Knight and Battle Mage just flat out turn into hulking battering rams that decimate the first guy they see. The amount of planning that you can make for a battle is amazing... I even got a chance to set up environmental hazards for the enemies by moving poison barrels and oil barrels ahead of a fight.   -The sneaking system is hilarious, but well maintained. Seeing a lizard tail poke out from under a barrel makes me giggle. The enemy vision scales down with higher thievery skills.  -The turn based fighting system is the best I have seen yet. It really feels like a ton of heart and effort has gone into this portion of the game. You need to see it to understand just how much it is like a legitamate DnD pen and paper style turn based system. It brings that niche genre to an immediate resurrection and breathes new life into it. Trust me, if you get this game for any reason, and you like turn based strategy, this is the very reason to get giddy like a damn school girl. The battle system alone is a game changer and was an insta buy for me and my friend.  -Choices, choices, choices. Choose wisely or shoot yourself in the foot... or shoot your friend in the foot... or shoot that annoying cat and feed it to the elf. I'm not joking, that cat is in the way all the time. I can't go 5 seconds without accidently lighting it on fire. The dialogue system is very well done and the choices you make will certainly matter. You can miss massive side quests that actually are very important to the overall story and your well being. Other mission and quests are just there to get your butt into a ton of trouble just because you said ""what's the worst that could happen?"". Everything... Just be careful with your choices. You may also live with any and every choice you make. Bad decisions can follow you and from the looks of it, can have consequences on the quests that get closed off because someone had a bad attitude with you or they got shanked unsuspectedly when you were looking the other direction. However, even bad decisions seem to lead down some interesting paths.   -Dialogue is absolutely amazing. Every character and NPC I have met so far is voiced and has a good feeling to their emotions. They always feel genuine, so far. I have yet to meet an NPC that had seemed overly annoying or out of place. The voice actors have done a really good job. My favorite part is the narrator, who has a soothing englishman's accent and doesn't feel snobby. Once again, props to the voice actors.  Neutral: -Have yet to experience the Game Master mode, yet the tutorial makes it out to be a true Dungeon Master style with 4 players under the control of the DM. You can make full campaigns and there are a literal sh*t ton of options. Just look up Game Master Tutorial on YouTube, which was made by the devs, and you'll see what I mean.  -If you don't pick one of the Main Characters, you may be missing out on massive parts of the story. Do not worry. If you create a custom character, you still have the option of taking 3 of the main characters along in your quests. Each main character has their own story and ambitions. Be sure to pay attention to them as they may lead you down some very interesting paths.  Cons: -I am legit am coming up short for things I do not like. There were some minor bugs when the game first released, but the devs seem to have a fast response time and are working diligently on most of the problems we were experiencing. In fact, most of the major issues disappeared on the first week. Sooooo... these are not the cons you are looking for..."

That being said, my ONE playthrough...took me 195 hours...and I loved every damn 11,700 minutes of it. I got the game less than a week ago.   There is so much I haven't done, so much that I intend to do in my next playthrough with friends. I also haven't tried any mods, the game is apparently as close to open source as you can get and it's super moddable.   There are full dialogue options, numerous perspectives and angles to take. You can do so much in this game and it's filled with so much content, honestly puts many many games to shame...♥♥♥♥♥♥drenched shame.   My experience was as ""Malcador"" the undead necromancer polymorph battlemage who somehow also managed to keep people alive with minor side effects. I walked upon the sands to meet my companions, whom I would never part with. Beast, Red Prince, Ifan. We fought monsters, found our callings, and had kickass adventures.   In my darkest hour, with only myself remaining and surrounded by vicious enemies...I looked into my inventory and saw salvation...""Death Fog Barrel"" In that moment I knew what I had to do, I dropped the barrel and hit it hard, everything arround me was dead and there was much rejoicing. And that is how I defeated the chicken warriors of karrakdo'.  I cannot say anything to do the game justice, the only thing I can come close to is that this game has EARNED its right to be called the Game of the Year.

LMW-YBC,137,4,1,January 20,Recommended,126.8,"I bought this game knowing nothing about the franchise or of its background. My friends wanted to play it as it had co-op and looked pretty nice from the screenshots we had, so we all picked it up and gave it a go. 50 hours later, we eventually managed to finish our first playthrough, and what I came out with is one of the most enjoyable game experiences I have ever had, and without a shadow of a doubt my game of the year for 2017.  First of all, I did not expect the writing or voice-acting to be as good as it is. There is a lot of genuinely captivating moments the game has and a good amount of decisions you can make, either as an individual or as a party. You really do feel like you are on this grand adventure, and you essentially make your own story (even if you play as one of the origin characters) which is awesome.  Now, I think I need to get onto what is the most amazing part of this game: the gameplay. On the surface it seems quite simple, and it isn't exactly difficult as you have plenty of time to make decisions and your abilities clearly show what you can and cannot do in your current position. But if you take the time to experiment with things, you can discover new things that can entirely change the way you battle. Elements can combine to create strong new effects, objects and characters can be blessed to create entirely different effects based on their surroundings, combining abilities can create fantastic (and sometimes even hilarious) opportunities for your party, and so on. You are actively encouraged to try out new things, which is something I rarely see games do now.  The diversity of abilities is also a huge plus. There are a bunch of skill paths you can choose from, each having their own unique abilities. You can focus on having a bit of everything, or you can focus on a couple of paths, but whatever you do you will be able to make it work as with many paths you have a lot of capabilities to control the battle, and with less paths your abilities will be much stronger and capable of dealing a lot of damage. Finding a mix-and-match of what works for your team best is part of the fun, you can even change your stats entirely at a certain point so you can change if you feel your current ones aren't working.  I think it's no surprise, but the game is damn pretty. Even for a top-down game the level of detail in the world is astounding, and the art style really appeals to me. It never stays the same either, as you explore you will find new areas that have an entirely different look and feel to the last place, usually accomodated by new enemy types as well. I love the different races and how they look, as well as how differently they are represented in the game's society. It's an exceptionally well-made fantasy world that still manages to be believable.  Such a great game, if you are even remotely into RPGs I would say give this one a go. It's best played with friends for sure, although playing solo is fine, too."

AstroBoltos ✦,135,4,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,287.2,"One of the most immersive RPG's I have ever played, although it's only a part of Act I the world in Divinity feels ro rich in life and lore. Playing classic mode is just about right in terms of difficulty the turn based combat makes it super complex, it's both easy to understand but  hard to master. Combat is super tactical you will find yourself struggling to keep your party at bay fighting hordes of enemies. The enemy A.I. feels natural as if you where actually facing a big threat in the dungeons, but it balances out with how good you level up and build your party. There's a bunch of stuff you can do while in combat such as positioning and combining different elements to your advantage but it's still very fun and doesnt feel repetitive. The crafting gets a little confusing, dont know if it's because I haven't found many recipes but through combining you pretty much go blindly into it and expect to get soom goodies such as consumables and learn the recipe.  The decision making in this game is pretty much a big deal, since it signifcantly affects the people you interact with and the outcome of any conversation related to your actions or thoughts. For an early access game its 10 times better than any mediocre regurgitated unpolished garbage on steam.  The Core gameplay will be fighting and looting corpses to get stronger, but you will find yourself with a lot of quests from various NPC'S and sub-story lines. Although I felt a little insecure with how quests didnt show any markers on the map or minimap it is very immersive that while chatting with NPC'S they can pin point a location of interest in the quest if the person you're talking to actually knows about it, instead of just telling you to do something and you as a player just feel like you are going through rails while discovering quests.   The amount of time I spent reading and nitpicking through my journal and conversations was just about right, not too confusing but not too easy, the game really does a great job at treating you as a competent player. While its easy to get lost on objectives and questlines you can always go back to the conversations you've had with your journal. The Soundtrack is Amazing you wont even feel it bothering you when jogging or fighting through the maps various and diverse locations.   Overall I said everything I had to although, I had encountered various bugs but nothing a good checkpoint cant fix and I cannot wait for the full realease. A very good experience for a fan of the genre. I think most people should have a fun time, but its far better when playing with your friends and having a blast. Interactivity with the world and the attention to detail that Larian studios has made is superb, trully a nice gem to be found. I strongly recommend you get this game if you are into gaming in general."
nikout13,565,4,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,164.2,"Sorcery, chivalry, pyromancy, rogues, necromancers and lizards are here and is all you need to embrace the world of Divinity in its second game of Original Sin! Many places to explore, many people to persue and many 'ventures to subdue. One of the most epic experiences so far delivered in a fantasy world, giving us more control on builds to make - be anything you want! Combine your summoning skills with your tanking approaches, making yourself a strong opponent to those who dare to face you. Many quests to complete; each one of them has a good start and its up to you entirely how you would like the result to be. Turn based combat mechanics, along with some events that occur during the fight turn tides for both of sides, watch for a third invader! A bit of a rushed character development at the start, but you will get the gist of each easily the more you interact with them, all of them provide many benefits and great moments to witness your character engaging. Play with friends, play in-character during dialogues that can make the options wider in terms of gameplay and character benefits.   One of the best RPG games I have played in a long time that keeps me sunk in for hours even days now! coming from a guy doing a singleplayer, it is astonishingly entertaining, and the encounters are very memorable.

PacManPolarBear,396,4,0,"October 16, 2017",Recommended,142.7,"The realm of Rivellon feels vibrant and alive. At times sunny and cheerful, with delightfully lighthearted moments, but also deeply disturbing and dark, unafraid of having players face things that can only be described as nightmare fuel. One minute you are talking to a happy bear about honey and the next you are running for your life from a giant spider that wants to feed you to its babies. The balance between those two, the light and the dark, is spot on. The storylines are wonderful and interesting, with tons of variety. Side quests don’t feel like filler content which is a big plus for a game as large and full of things to do as Divinity: Original Sin 2 is.   It's one of the best looking isometric RPG’s ever made. Each of the games four major areas are exquisitely detailed and beautiful in their own unique way. Characters have subtle animations and visual flourishes that really make them stand out. The colour pallet is vibrant, gorgeous and bright with striking blue, green, red and yellow colours. The game does makes sure to contrast that with deep blacks, subtle grays and dark reds when fighting in the darker, more evil infested areas. Everything is visually interesting.  The soundtrack is wonderful. Joyous and fun one moment, tense and foreboding the next. None of the music feels repetitive or overstays its welcome. The sinister transition music that rings out when you enter truly dangerous areas still makes a shiver run up my spine every time I hear it. The fact that every line of dialogue in the game is voice acted is impressive and almost always of impeccable quality. It really helps sells the games more emotional moments.  The turn based combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2 is all about interconnected systems. Fire ignites poison clouds or oil slicks. Rain puts out fire while ice can trip up enemies and allies alike. Necromancy can raise the dead or curse the living but can be countered by healing magic. Everything has a counterpoint of some type and a well coordinated exchange can take advantage of any number of systems to powerful effect. Unlike D&D games where your characters live or die by a lucky or unlucky roll of the dice, Divinity: Original Sin 2 does not make players worship at the alter of the RNG (random number generation) gods quite so much.  The longer you play the more complex the combat interactions. By the time you reach the mid to late game the list of abilities and spells at your disposal is vast. Even though each character chooses a class at the beginning of the game you can place points into whatever skill trees and abilities you want. The game encourages experimentation and since you can respec as much as you want once you leave the games first area there is nothing to stop you from making a character that is exactly what you want it to be.  The early game leans a bit too heavily on basic elemental exchanges like fire and ice, but eventually you’ll spend just as much time raising the dead, summoning demons, blinding your foes or charming people as you will tossing fireballs and ice shards. Because you have so many options when it comes to combat a lot of players have found ways to cheese the system. Some interactions were things the developers intended, but others are clearly breaking the game in ways they never considered. Patches post launch have addressed some of these issues, such as inflicting bleeding damage on an enemy and then transforming them into a chicken that runs itself to death. Or infinite damage loops that result from the interplay between buffs and attacks. That said the game encourages players to find innovative ways to tackle major obstacles. My personal favorite tactic it using teleport to push a tough enemy into the path of another powerful NPC and watch them tear each other to pieces.  Even with the ability to cheese the system at times and the plethora of options at your disposal, playing Divinity: Original Sin 2 on anything above Explorer difficulty can be really, really tough. Especially your first 10 hours with the game as you learn the intricacies of its many systems and options. The AI is smart and deadly and will throw every trick in the book at you. I restarted my campaign a half dozen times and invested almost 20 hours before I found a party composition and set of builds I felt complemented the way I wanted to play the game.  The game features a robust crafting system. Dozens of spells, potions, meals, enchantments and items can be crafted. You can learn recipes from books or experiment on your own to learn new ones. The one area where crafting falls short is weapons and armour.  Freedom and experimentation is at the very heart of what makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing. It applies not only to combat but how you tackle the games many quests and challenges. Almost everything has multiple avenues of approach and a myriad of solutions. The games main story quests give you a direction to aim yourself at but how you get there is completely up to you.  However this is also where Divinity: Original Sin 2‘s biggest problem rears its head. The game is terrible at informing you if you are on the right track in completing certain quest lines and is often vague, to the point of maddening frustration, when it comes to giving you any sort of hint when it comes to what you should do next. On the one hand it is nice that the game does not hold your hand as if you were a child who never played an RPG before, but on the other it would be nice to know why a quest that seems to be over isn’t. Sometimes you are not sure if you just missed something or if the quest line is just bugged because you approached it in a way the developers never expected or tested for.  This issue becomes more apparent the further along you get in the game. Act 1 is relatively aggravation free when it comes following quest lines or encountering bugs. But by the end of Act 2 you’ll likely pull your hair out over at least a few quests or nonsensical bugs. The game has been out a month now and I’m still locked out of a handful of quest the developers have acknowledged are broken because of the way I triggered them. I was able to get past the major bugs that were in my way but a bunch still remain. The very thing that makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing is the same thing that has caused issues with progressing further down quest lines or receiving rewards.  It’s by no means a game breaker and given the immense size of Divinity: Original Sin 2 and the sheer scope of what you can choose to do its amazing the game does not have more issues. The quest log definitely needs an overhaul and there are several major bugs that still need addressing but Larian Studios has already dropped a few hotfixes and one very large patch to address players concerns. Given the wonderful support Divinity: Original Sin 1 received I have no doubt that Divinity: Original Sin 2‘s remaining blemishes will be ironed out before too long."

The companions are great I personally have hydro mage, rouge awesomeness elf, and handsome hunter. I also want to completere their own stories because its just so interesting to experience.   The fact that most people hate me cause I'm a lizard is cool because the story rotates on what race you are as well. I might even make a second character just to see the reactions and how playing with different companions play out.

I saw a lot of merit to its combat, flexible quests and vibrant presentation, but thought the lack of direction, both from a narrative and gameplay standpoint, alongside some tonal issues, were sore points that kept me from really breaking into it. Several years later and Larian Studios have done just what I hoped they would, making a sequel that retains the strengths of previous game while addressing just about every issue I had with it, and then going even further with additions like full voice acting, something not generally found in the recent wave of cRPG games. Due to the relatively high difficulty and patience required it may still not be for everybody, but Divinity: Original Sin 2 is very much at the pinnacle of the sub-genre and will no doubt prove intoxicating for those who get trapped in its spell.   continue reading [www.newgamenetwork.com] "

In response to that article I love having almost nothing at the beginning and having to scavenge. The loot system is really rewarding right now and I feel every piece of armour or weapon i find is making a difference in fights on Classic mode. Magic and Phsyical armour is great too, it's satisfying to break through armour and seeing the health bar drop like in bayonetta.  Only thing I wish which I loved in Pillars of Eternity was the ability to click on the map and have the camera go directly to that spot. Would save a lot of pointless time in moving the map trying to figure out where it is I want to go. Other than that this game pulled me right in.  "

darthaegis,187,5,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,56.8,"TL:DR Original Sin II is very good. If you want a game with really fun combat and some good exploration, you've got one right here. The game maintains a higher overall standard of quality than its predecessor, but combat has some big issues and the later two areas are fairly weak. I found it to be good, but I was disappointed at the lack of improvement over a lot of areas where the first game could use some. ★★★★☆  Divinity: Original Sin II is an isometric RPG where you play as a Sourcerer, a person capable of wielding the mighty power of Source. You get to pick your character and choose a preset class or edit one, and choose an origin or just create a custom character altogether. Origin characters have actual personal stories and motivations in the world besides the beginning of the main plot. My character seemed a bit meh at first (Sebille, an elf looking for the lizard who enslaved her so she could kill him) but it got to an interesting twist. Other characters I picked on my party ended up being more interesting, but you don't get direct access to their conversations. The game isn't really big on choices and consequences, so I found these things mostly side fluff.  The main plot begins with your character and all origin characters, as well as the starting cutscene narrator, being sent to a prison-island (the rather ironically named Fort Joy) to get treated of their Source condition. It's totally fine to be able to shoot fireballs since that's not Sourcery, but using that to remove debuffs or get yourself an extra turn gets you imprisoned because it attracts Voidwoken, creatures which only appear near manifestations of Source. There's quite a lot of ways to escape Fort Joy, which makes it feel a bit strange how there are still so many people inside. There's also the fact there are weapon and skill trader prisoners, which makes me feel the setting wasn't very well thought out.  To be honest, since I played the first game at launch, I wasn't expecting a terrific story/setting from this one. But for all the new writers they hired, it feels like there's not a huge improvement. The story didn't really grab me, even though it was better than the last game's ""There's this big dragon you have to defeat."" It did the job for giving you an extra reason to explore the world, but I didn't find it anything groundbreaking. After 56 hours I got the ending cutscene showing the consequences of my actions throughout the game ala Fallout, and I found I didn't remember half the people the cutscene was talking about at first (one or two I chuckled while hearing what they did after the ending, since I actually killed them in the game).  Anyway, enough with story crap, since the Original Sin games are more about exploring and using massive cheese to kill things or reach places which are difficult to reach. Exploration is fun, and there's a lot of interesting things to find in the four areas of the game, but the latter two (also, fortunately, the shortest, occupying roughly 15 of my 56 hours) are where the game starts to fall off in quality. The final area seemed to lack polish on a basic level, even: I found a corpse named UNKNOWN and a portrait with the name ""Painting of a Fan - Placeholder"". The first two areas tend to be more fun, but the thing is they felt fairly railroaded as for where to go. Even though you can sometimes go to places you have no business being in by use of teleportation skills, it's often very hard to fight enemies which are even only one level above you. This makes it so you have to almost take a specific path through the game in order not to find massive difficulty spikes. The second area also feels a bit themepark-y, with some clear sub-area separation by a sort of theme (desert, cemetery, etc.).  Exploring will get you some really creative quests, ranging from helping animals find love to more serious matters like stopping people from getting killed. The quest log doesn't often give you an ultra-clear indication on what to do, so it's fun to experiment a bit (though sometimes what you have to do to progress is fairly weird to think of, especially towards the endgame). Your characters will often find hidden switches and buried chests with treasure, too. The items are mostly randomized and you won't stay with them for long since they become obsolete at level up, but it's still fun to find good loot.  Original Sin II's strongest point, like its predecessor, is, of course, the combat. Unfortunately, they ♥♥♥♥ed up some things here. First, the level difference is the most important stat in combat unless you intend to do ungodly cheese like unloading boxes of Deathfog on someone (instantly killing any non-undead) or teleporting them to a high-level NPC, and this is worse at certain levels where HP and damage numbers just get an arbitrary 50% boost. Then you have the fact that everything has been very much simplified (attributes and skills pretty much only giving +5% bonuses to a stat now, and there being a fixed AP for all characters unless hasted, which means you pretty much level your damage stat in braindead mode until you need some initiative or skill slots). You also have a new armor system made to make combat not be a disable-fest immediately, but having it take three turns of whittling down a secondary HP bar so you can start a cancerous disable-fest. Finally, initiative (the stat which determines how early your turn is in the whole combat round) is broken and non-moddable unlike the rest of these problems. It's basically a forced player-enemy-player round order which makes initiative a lot less meaningful.  With the (massive) problems combat has out of the way, the big upside to it is that it's still ridiculous fun. The addition of two new skill types (Polymorph and Summoning) increased the variety in builds by a lot. Unfortunately you can't respec on the first act, but this helps figure out a party plan for the rest of the game, where you can do it with no cost. I ended up going with a sub-optimal party composition (with three massive physical damage dealers and only one magician, which doesn't often work well because of the armor system, where there is a separate value for physical damage/disable blocking and magical), but it got me through the game with no major difficulty (though I must stress that since I didn't find my level's area at a certain point in the game, I started squeezing every bit of XP from quests I had left, leaving me overleveled by 1-2 levels for 40% of the game, which made it probably a lot easier). Each skill type has quite a lot of different spells, enabling your creativity to get out of particularly hard fights. While physical damage is mostly clean for the environment, magical will make your battleground an entertaining chaos of fire, poison and electrified water, to name a few (mostly fire though), and I don't think I'll forget a certain fight on an oil rig (I imagine my graphics card won't either, as it's likely scarred from having to render so much goddamn fire!) This doesn't mean physical damage is less fun, as both the Scoundrel and Warfare trees give some decent mobility for melee fighters to get into position and backstab or smash foes to the ground, and rangers are made more fun in this game with the addition of high ground, making positioning even more important, and fights more interesting in general. The summoning skill tree is mostly about strengthening your summons, the main one being the Incarnate, whose abilities change depending on the surface it's cast on (the Incarnate gets a powerful upgrade ONLY at max summoning, which I found fairly dumb). It's really amazing that with all its problems, Original Sin II's combat is still so goddamn fun.  In the end, it's more Original Sin: the story's better, and exploring and fighting still rewards creativity. I was disappointed that they didn't improve that much, but I still had good fun with the game."

Stevo Jenkins,145,3,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,147.9,"This game takes the rich story, great turn-based combat and awesome character progression from the previous game and has built/improved it by tenfold.  Adding in extra races, characters with origin stories that actually effect the story of the game, having a storyline that makes more sense then the last game and adding in romance options has really created an atmosphere that exeeds the previous game.  Adding in more spells (a new school has been added; Polymorph) and adding physical armour and magic armour instead of just health has really expanded on the combat.  The only con to this game is the quests and the way that they are explained/the player is directed. This was a problem in the previous game, where if you don't do the quest exactly as the game wants it, you won't complete it. As well as this, the game once again doesn't explain quests adequetly. Quests will have very vague references that leave the player running around entire maps not understanding what the next step is. This was a very big problem for me in the Driftwood area, where there were a lot of quests, but I was given literally nothing to give me a clue as where to go.  I'd still give the game a 9/10 regardless, because I liked this game very much, and still continue to play it. There's a lot more content here than the previous game."

That's insane, and really makes Larian one of most realiable and trusted names in video gaming.

I find myself sitting idle just marveling at some of the game's foilage, and enviroments.  + It's optimized for lower end systems, and they are saying Mac support is likely as well. + RNG elements have been minimized with a tremendous loot system that makes each playthrough unique, but dependable.  + Highly custimizable skills and talents that truly allow you to make whatever you deem worthy of your time, and party composition.  + Multiplayer/Co-op are amazing, and even more enjoyable than the solo matches  + All Origin characters have depth, personalities, and stories that are woven into the fabric of the game.

Suárez,108,3,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,367.3,"Long story short: this game is as close as a PC RPG can be to tabletop. 9.5/10    In my opinion, Divinity has 3 main selling points: a deep storyline that unfolds as you progress through the main quest and the various sidequests, and that's shaped by your decisions; a complex combat system that looks simpler that it is at first, and that takes a little while to get used to, and brings some refreshing concepts to tactical RPGs; and almost complete freedom given to the player.  Almost every quest, if not all of them, has more than a single outcome, and plenty of different ways to reach those ends. Furthermore, sidequests often overlap and meet each other, which simultaneously deepens the plot and encourages and rewards players for exploring. Frequently, puzzles or obstacles have multiple different solutions available; depending on your playstyle and party configuration, one solution or another may be easier or simpler.  Starting on Act II, you'll have access to free, infinite resets of your characters' atrributes, stats, and talents. This allows for extreme customization and adaptability - if a particular battle is proving to be too difficult, going back and trying a new configuration can be key. It also encourages players to try different combinations of skills. It should be noted that despite what the character creation screen says, there are really no classes in the game - anyone can be anything. The only requirements for equipment are your main stats (Strength, Finesse, Intelligence and Constitution), and for skills, your Ability Points. As long as you have the money to purchase Equipment and Skillbooks, you can customize your characters at will. (A remark: as of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I am not sure if this reset mechanic is available in the last Act. Most likely, I just didn't find it, but it's worth mentioning nonetheless)  On the flipside, the absolute freedom provided by the game can leave you lost at times. I am a very deliberate player and tried to uncover every quest and each corner of the map, and once, on Act II, I found myself facing very tough battles because I was actually supposed to be on the opposite side of the map - I figured this out when I went to said area and enemies were 3 levels lower than my party, which is quite rare in this game and made those battles trivial even on Tactician mode.  Another little complaint: characters with high Wits can find hidden objects in the map. Most of the time, those are hidden treasures you can dig for loot, but sometimes they uncover quest items, like hidden doors, levers or buttons. When those items are uncovered, your character will they spotted something, and the object will glow; but especially in the case of the small buttons, it's not obvious enough where the object is. It can be quite frustrating to spend minutes looking around for a button - I can understand having to do it manually, but if your character already FOUND it, it should be very clearly marked on the map and/or the screen, even more so in the case of plot related objects.  As for bugs, the game is not nearly as bugged as other reviews have made it sound like, although I only bought the game 3 days after release and the developers have been working on patches constantly, so some earlier bugs may have been fixed before I played the game. As of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I only encountered 3 ""serious"" bugs (naturally, they may be fixed already; also, minor spoilers ahead). The first was in Act II - talking to an NPC with may main character cancelled dialogues and interactions with said character permanently. A quick search on Google revealed a fix for this available a little later in the Act, but I simply loaded a save game made a couple of minutes earlier and proceeded as normal, ignoring the buggy NPC. The second was in Act IV; I was unable to complete the Blood Dowry sidequest, as the groom never appeared in his house's basement at all (probably my fault for breaking into his house and looting his stuff before actually realizing it was a quest point). The last bug was just weird and had no game breaking effect (aside from making me lose 2 Action Points in battle). In the final battle, when I used Battle Stomp on the Kraken, my screen switched to what seemed like the corner of the map, switched back, and no damage was dealt, but the Skill was used. Although I must remark that going after the Kraken was not a particularly promising strategy anyway...  (end of spoilers)  To sum it up, the game is fantastic. The dialogues are rich and provided with excellent voice acting, the plot is deep, the combat is fulfilling and the whole experience feels rewarding. A must have if you enjoy the genre."

head_red,71,3,0,"November 9, 2017",Recommended,324.2,"This review will be most helpful for the type of gamer like me, and the following is what I like/look for and rate games on:   - immersive dialouge/story - 9/10 - auditory experience - 8/10 - challenging playthrough - 10/10  - immersive dialouge/story -  The D&D style narrations and dialouge options had me spending hours loading and tweaking conversations just to uncover how many nuances there are to be had in the game. Only on my second playthrough (because I can't stop) am I realizing how much story you will uncover or leave uncovered depending on who in your party is the flag-ship communicator with NPC's. I haven't felt this satisfied with dialouge since I played Fallout 2, if thats a good reference.  - auditory experience  sound effects, voice-acting, and sound tracks. These make up about 50% of what makes a game immersive for me. Every NPC is voice-casted well, sound effects are great, and the music is incredibley well done. Only reason for 8/10 is because, due to bugs or something, there will be lulls between tracks, effectively inturrupting the flow (imagine watching your favorite movie in the theater and a phone lights up). Fix this, add a few new tracks, and this goes to 10/10.  - challenging playthrough I loved WoW years ago (2007-2008) because of the way the game punished you for overestimating opponents and underestimating preparedness. RPG's today feel so overly generous to players in combat, and I was *overly excited* to find myself becoming angry and loading the game multiple times from dying. I also have only played this game on Tactician, and I highly recommend it."

IamKayoh,309,3,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,126.5,"This is the first review I'm writing for a video game on Steam in several thousands of hours logged across many titles. If you enjoy Pathfinder/DnD. Get this. Get it with a buddy if you can and you both go in blind. That's what I did and it has been the best gaming experience I have had since being a kid. I've audibly gasped, I've giggled like a kid. I've had some Ah ha! and some oh♥♥♥♥♥♥... I want to include a small example as to why this game is an absolute must have and why it's so incredible to play with a friend.   Whatever you do, don't read any guides. Get lost, explore. Find neat♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't worry about your build or misspending points. I'm only level 7 on several play throughs but I have already mutated builds so suddenly in just a level or two it's not worth playing through the boat twenty times.   If you are planning on playing Divinity II do not read the next part. If you're on the fence, read the next part.     ****SMALL SPOILER AHEAD*****   There is a side quest early in the game involving what appears to be an undead/zombie man on a beach. My party decided to kill him before attempting anything else and we ended up with this sweet ring. The problem was, this ring belonged to a person that a Magister was looking for. Well♥♥♥♥♥♥ let's go talk to her and let her know this guy is dead. So we go talk to the Magister. Turns out this guy is her father. We tell her he's dead and looked super nasty. She asks for proof and the only proof we have is this ♥♥♥♥ing guys ring.   Let me pause for a moment. For this early on, this ring is like a ♥♥♥♥ing cheat code. It gives magic armor, some other stat, but the big thing is that is let's the user cast restoration.   So the only way to advance the quest is to give her the ring, otherwise she thinks you're ♥♥♥♥ing with her to get her to leave her post. We decide we wanna see the event through, so I give up my precious and we follow her back to the beach where this Magister is losing her mind and crying over her undead (now dead) father's corpse. Clearly she's distraught, but I want that ♥♥♥♥ing ring. She's not gonna give it up, it's her Dad's ring and he's ♥♥♥♥ing dead and corrupted in front of her.  After getting caught attempting to pickpocket the ring which I still maintain is what literally every rogue-ish character would do in this situation, me and my friend found ourselves in combat with a Magister. My friend who has taken a starting level in necromancer starts laughing uncontrollably and we both watch as his little Dwarf named Opal raises the Magister's fathers body into a grotesque pile of gore, and then slaps the now distraught Magister in the face with her (un)undead father's intestines which then exploded into a cloud of viscera and splooge.   Seriously, get this game, get off the boat, and start exploring. Get creative, there's a lot you can do and many ways to do it.    "
TrumpKingsly,149,3,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,136.4,"This is an extremely deep, extremely interesting RPG (gameplay and narrative) that doesn't know how combat works and rushes the everloving Hell out of its ending.  The Narrative is Easily the Best Part of this Game The narrative is about power and servitude. A movie would typically tackle this subject using a protagonist and an antagonist in a singular case study. We'd form some kind of opinion on it after seing what goes down between those two people. Original Sin 2 is a 100+ hour videogame that tackles the subject using many protags and antags in many separate and different case studies and thought experiments. This means we form our opinion after seeing the power/servitude dynamic play out in a bunch of different contexts. It's really effective at helping the player form a rich opinion, by the time it's done.  But Combat and the Ending are Serious Sore Spots However, there are two jagged thorns stuck deep within the side of this game: combat difficulty and the story's ending. These thorns are so jagged, in fact, that I have a major doubt: the review outlets giving this a 10/10 probably didn't finish the game and probably played it on easy mode.  Combat encounters are each either so easy that none of your party even lose their armor, or they're actually impossible to win. There is no middle ground. When they're impossible, this is because the game cheats on behalf of your enemies. They get an astounding number of action points in a turn. They cast the same AoE decimator spell every single turn. They mind control your party through their magic armor. They're a mob, each member of which has infinite initiative, so they all go before your first party member has their turn. Or you make a certain ludicrous decision at the end game and you're faced with a 1v10 that gives you one move to kill everyone. Hilarious.  To win these impossible fights, you have to cheat. Save scum, obviously. But, beyond that, you have to reload, then position your party as if they're psychics--in ways you could not possibly have known would work before going into the fight the first time. Or, you have to destroy parts of the environment before stepping on that tile that triggers the fight. Or, you have to kill all the nurses in the Doctor's house before you go and talk to him. Cheat at this game. Become a save-scum psychic and leave your foes baffled at your god-like foresight.  And then there's the ending. The gameplay leading to the end is pretty cool. Some complicated puzzles, most of which are literally spelled out for you if you talk to everyone in the final zone. But at least one puzzle will remain unspoiled until you have to complete it.  Then, you get a huge boss fight full of cheating enemies that you win by the skin of your teeth. Almost all of those enemies are, as far as I can tell, the biggest narrative inconsistency in history. Then, the narrator gives you some boilerplate about ""remember all that stuff that happened in the game."" That is just barely a paraphrase of what he says. Character- and decision-specificity are at absolute 0 in that boilerplate. Then, he asks ""Remembering that stuff, what do you do?"" You pick one of three choices. I picked the first choice. ""Okay, so you picked the first choice. Now you get this thing. What do you do with it?"" Three more choices. You pick one and get 30-60 seconds of post-game cutscene featuring some vagary about a character that really didn't matter and an extremely brief summary of the way things stand after your decision.  And then you're done. Recently, Larian enabled playing after the endgame, so you're brought back to your base to finish side quests or otherwise derp about with your endgame loot. Here's the thing, though. 3/4 of my party died during the last fight. Never got a chance to res anyone. One of that 3/4 was the character I created at the start. So, another party member won the game. Only my created character goes back to base after the credits, and guess what? He's still dead, so I get a game over screen and am asked to reload the boss fight.  Nice.  Conclusion This game is extremely good. Addictive, even. It stands tall and proud above most other story-driven games I've ever played. Then, there are the ""challenging"" fights and the sloppy, heartless ending that easily hack off its legs at the knees. Overall, I recommend, because 125/126 hours being fantastic is a great thing. But, that hour of poor quality is a really, super important hour."

RT-XD,296,3,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,144.4,"I've been holding out on writing a review for this game until I finished it, which took ages because I put the difficulty to tactician mode which made things extremely difficult!! (But very fun!) I put 144H to finish one playthrough.  The best way I can put it is: it's probably the best game I've ever played since Witcher 3.  I backed this game after playing the first Original Sin, which left me wanting to play even more! I definitely made the right decision. There's a lot of freedom in this game; playing with friends, playing alone and even doing our own DM games. I only played it in Single player mode so far, but I'm very much looking forward to playing with friends when they get the game. Here's a general pros and cons list (from a single player perspective):  + Graphics are great + Runs really well + Gameplay is fantastic (if you like turn-based games) + You can pretty much do anything and kill anyone you want + Voice acting is phenominal + Companions each have their own backgrounds which tie in with the main story line, really giving you a sense of wonder and motivation to find out what's going on and how to 'fix' it. + Workshop and Modding (read below for more)  - There were a few issues with quests not finishing properly, or not being able to talk properly to some NPCs, leading to missed XP and story (but a lot of that got fixed recently) - Tactician mode is difficult. Really makes you work hard to find as much XP before moving onto other parts. Especially at the beginning of the game.  Now here's the BEST part of all this: Larian even gave us the Divinity Engine 2 to us for making our own Campains and DM games. Which means...we can look forward to people creating their own stories and Campaigns in the future - something which I really look forward to seeing and playing.   Get it now! It's totally worth it!  EDIT: Nominated for the ""Even better than I expected"" award. Because it truly was better than I expected...makes sense right?"

Darkhollow,264,3,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,146.3,"I would like to preface some things before I start my review: I have been a fan of Larian and their Divine Divinity games since the first game in the series that came out in 2002.  It has taken me 145 hours to complete Divinity Original Sin 2 and I just want to say that it was one of the best CRPG experiences that I have had since I finished Planescape Torment (for the first time) back in 2013.   Now onto the  Pro and Cons followed by my final thoughts.  Pro:   - Interesting story & interesting party members with choice & consequences - Amazing soundtrack - Great replayability (multiple endings, different classes & origins to pursue) - All dialogue is fully voiced (major props to Larian for taking the huge undertaking on fully voicing every line of dialogue in the game) - Robust crafting system - Interactive open world gameplay (picking up objects and moving them around to your advantage or to plan strategies) - Robust character & class customization with the option of respeccing  Cons:  - Optimization issues mainly in the second half of the game/later acts (solved via patches) - Some bugged quests that don't complete properly or don't trigger (solved via patches) - No search item bar option in the inventory for specific items (quality of life improvement)   Conclusion: The sheer amount of content and replayability that you get from this game is staggering and I cannot fathom how Larian have managed to create such an amazing game in such a short span of time (2 years).   I would like to thank Larian and everyone involved including the Kickstarter backers help create this masterpiece. The praise it has received from numerous gaming outlets is well deserved.  Now...do I recommend this game?

It's getting very good reviews.  Suffice to say that it's one of the only RPGs that tick all the boxes for me.  I'm a story guy, and it has excellent writing, voice acting, and role-playing.  But what really sets this game apart for me is how diverse and engaging the gameplay is.  It has an Ultima-like world model sandbox quality to it, and the combat (which is boring to me in about 90% of all RPGs) is consistently excellent.    The reason I'm writing this, though, is because of the many ""it's buggy and crashes all the time"" reports.  I can't say for sure that it's *not* crashing for those folks, because why would they lie?  All I can tell you is that I have played for over 50 hours and have not had a single crash.  Not one.

Wonder Llama,205,3,0,"October 4, 2017",Recommended,271.1,"This is possibly one of the first times I've really stopped to review a game in any thoughtful manner. I'm not one for doing so, or for commenting in public in general. That in itself should tell you something about the sheer brilliance of this game.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is quite possibly one of the best games ever created, or at the very least one of the best RPGs ever made. Never before have I been so sucked in, so compelled by a game and its story, lore, and characters.  One of the first things you'll notice about DOS2 is the atmosphere. The musical cues, the environment, the feel of ever-present danger, a truly epic quest, and of course, the soundtrack. My god, the soundtrack.  Combat is innovative and feels really good. With an 'open-class' concept and enough spells and abilities, you can make just about any kind of character you could imagine. From a blood-sucking witch that dabbles in lightning to a sturdy warrior with a healing spell or two. And more notably, many of these spells can be combined with either others or the environment to create incredible effects. Toss a fireball into a pit of poison to make it explode into flames, or shock a pool of blood or water to possibly stun everyone caught within.  The game is hard at times, surely. Even on the easiest difficulty (which honestly can be -too- easy sometimes), you'll have to have to really think about the battlefield conditions. Honour mode especially gets mention; brutal, wonderfully intense combat mixed with your basic ironman mode. Wipe your whole party and its game over with a single save.  Finally, it's the story that truly shines in this game. I've played a -lot- of games in my day, but hands-down DOS2 is one of the single most powerful games I've played. The main story is sturdy enough to stand on its own and only gets better as you venture onward, and especially the last few hours will have you questioning everything. Your companions, who take the form of the other origins stories you don't pick at the start, have rich storylines each with a very nice twist. The voice acting is excellent, as is the narration, and the ability to romance one of your companions later in the story makes for a pleasant little plot point.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an incredible game, and you can tell Larian took their time to create a masterpiece. They succeeded. I can't see myself putting it down anytime soon. Fans of oldschool-esque RPGs with heavy emphasis on story, rejoice. Our savior has finally come."
Morador,234,3,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,115.5,"Divinity Original Sin blew away my every expectation.  Seeing how Larian Studio built upon the Original Sin, I can only regret I did not give them more money during their kickstarter campaign. A true master piece, from a Studio that seem to have genuine passion for their work."
bigeyoo,136,3,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,137.1,"I enjoyed the original Original Sin (heh) and felt this game would follow suit. I got into the early access and it felt very similar to the first, but more polished and the layout was more efficient.   The story is extremely in-depth, voice acting is exceptional with almost every npc having dialogue, a voice, and personality following suit.  The combat is great, targetting has been improved and what the reticle shows will happen is the actual result for the most part. Occasionally the abilities will miss, or you will accidentally move your character when you misclicked.   My only qualm is really the fact that I now have 6 friends who want to play with me, but we can't really get that together at once."
Kay_Hikari,362,3,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,14.8,"Buy it buy it know :p, fun game to play you have a narator in the game for those that dont like reading the story, up to 4players in story mode rather than 2 in the 1st one, you can also make your own story to play through, in essence its like have multiple games in one think its well worth the price."

RT-XD,296,3,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,144.4,"I've been holding out on writing a review for this game until I finished it, which took ages because I put the difficulty to tactician mode which made things extremely difficult!! (But very fun!) I put 144H to finish one playthrough.  The best way I can put it is: it's probably the best game I've ever played since Witcher 3.  I backed this game after playing the first Original Sin, which left me wanting to play even more! I definitely made the right decision. There's a lot of freedom in this game; playing with friends, playing alone and even doing our own DM games. I only played it in Single player mode so far, but I'm very much looking forward to playing with friends when they get the game. Here's a general pros and cons list (from a single player perspective):  + Graphics are great + Runs really well + Gameplay is fantastic (if you like turn-based games) + You can pretty much do anything and kill anyone you want + Voice acting is phenominal + Companions each have their own backgrounds which tie in with the main story line, really giving you a sense of wonder and motivation to find out what's going on and how to 'fix' it. + Workshop and Modding (read below for more)  - There were a few issues with quests not finishing properly, or not being able to talk properly to some NPCs, leading to missed XP and story (but a lot of that got fixed recently) - Tactician mode is difficult. Really makes you work hard to find as much XP before moving onto other parts. Especially at the beginning of the game.  Now here's the BEST part of all this: Larian even gave us the Divinity Engine 2 to us for making our own Campains and DM games. Which means...we can look forward to people creating their own stories and Campaigns in the future - something which I really look forward to seeing and playing.   Get it now! It's totally worth it!  EDIT: Nominated for the ""Even better than I expected"" award. Because it truly was better than I expected...makes sense right?"

I hate how rewarding the game is when you complete a quest; Overthrow and assassinate a corrupt world leader? Fight a giant purple worm? Slay an evil witch to free and befriend a ♥♥♥♥ing DRAGON?! ♥♥♥♥. YES. THAT IS AWESOME. This is not even end game stuff, I've only gotten to the 2nd area.   I hate this game because it is ruining my life by being so addictive I'd rather retrace my 2.5 hours of gameplay due to not saving than to get off my♥♥♥♥♥and do homework. AND this is only the single player experience. Buy this game NOW if you've ever liked a game even remotely similar to this one. D&D, WoW (or any MMORPG), any action RPG like Diablo or Path of Exile, or just fastasy games in general. Solid 9/10 discounting their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ save system. So just REMEMBER TO SAVE AFTER EVERY FIGHT, THEY WON'T SAVE YOUR GAME FOR YOU, SERIOUSLY THIS IS THE ONLY BAD THING IN THE GAME.   Ok, I'm done. The rest is for the Devs. I love your game, just make it so I can live my life and play your game too. 9/10.   Dear Larian Studios,  You've got to get your♥♥♥♥♥♥together. I have lost and retraced at least 10-12 hours of my 50 hours of gameplay due to forgetting that this game only quicksaves every blue moon. I understand that there are settings and sliders to determine when saves happen, but either I'm a complete dunce or that system is confusing. ALSO, QUICKSAVE BEFORE FIGHTS HAPPEN. I don't care if they spoil the surprise, just... At the beginning of a hostile area, or whenever you're about to talk to someone who's supposed to kill you, please help a bro out so they don't have to redo their search for source, resurrection scrolls AND two long♥♥♥♥♥fight scenes.   Your game is a work of art and I haven't even got out of the hollow marshes yet. Would be a 10/10 if the saves didn't ♥♥♥♥ me over so often."

PipTheGrunt,190,3,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,114.6,"Divinity: The Original Vietnam War  Everyerthing is Flames, Every step i take, every move i make, flames. Fire is eternal, just get use to the burn damage  Editing this review to be more serious and to encourage others to play this, but there is honestly no words to convey what is simply an actual work of art graphically, mechanically, art and graphically, character and storywise.  Sit in the mainmenu and let the opening theme drag you into the mood of the game. Start a fight and let the orchestra rise and hype you to fight dragons and demons, or a fistfight in a tavern gets even more roudy with the mixture of brass and string. start the character screen and listen to the origin stories of all the characters for your first game,  listening to the fully voiced professional voice actors lay the background for the Characters own subplots that string along with the main game(Lohse is awesome as is the Red Prince).  Start your game and enjoy every view, walk along beaches of ruined castles, explore though caves with ancient unknown ruins, walk through the massive capital of Rivellon And just get wrapped up as the story twists and turns its way through the mythical land of rivelon for almost 120 hours of straight story that i honestly lost track of time playing (alot of my time was spent playing offline) And the best part? Do it all again and its just as good. Me and 3 friends all made custom characters and we are doing it all again and its just as fun as when we first started, the game was made for the party of 4 aspect like a good D&D game with your best friends after school.  Even if the main story wears you out, the game offers a well thought out editor to make your own maps and campaigns to really bring that D&D experience back, or download a top rated campaign from the workshop, all while playing the soundtrack back on youtube on a playlist because that full orchestra really gets me  Normally games in the 40-50 price range turn me around but this game really shines in a time of half completed main industry titles and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥resells of RPGs, this game will bring back that experience of the golden age of game design when games were meant to be played and not sold. It deserves its overwhelmingly positive score, its nomination for RPG of the year despite being a PC only title as i was just that much loved by those who played it, and it deserves more people to play and love it just as me and my friends have. This Divinity title will remain special to me, and in my eyes made Game of the Year 2017"
Roger Feederer,204,3,0,"November 12, 2017",Recommended,42.8,"The true game of the year in 2017.  Hopefully the steam review system/tagging system gets this game to pop up on your store, because you probably won't hear about it from major outlets or podcasts.  I honestly thought turn based strategy had gone the way of XCOM.  Divinity, however, can be more readily compared to Dragon Age: Origins...only with more story, more character customization, interesting party members and fun yet challenging combat.  There's no need to experience any of the previous games (I didn't).  If you have ever enjoyed RPGs then play this game."

RainyDay,121,3,0,March 31,Recommended,129.6,"An absolutely incredible experience, without a doubt, one of the finest rpgs to date, it certainly is the best I’ve ever played.  I wouldn’t know where to begin, the world is as interesting and alive as the long and beautifully crafted story, which stays strong for almost all of its entire 130h runtime.  If you’re new to rpgs, you might be put off by the inherent amount of lore and world building exposition these kinds of games often exhibit, but I must say that the game does a remarkable job of giving you all the information you need without overwhelming you. The world building is constant and just detailed enough as to make you want to fill in the details yourself using your own imagination.  Having not played the original Divinity Original Sin, I did not once feel like I was missing some important piece of lore or that I had missed out on anything story-wise, which is something I truly appreciate from the developers.  The writing is witty, fresh and fully voice acted. Not one person, monster or animal goes without a voice. The voice acting is also excellent, a pleasant surprise seeing how much has been had to be dubbed.  Combat is a lot of fun, and it only gets better the more you level up and are able to experiment with new interesting skills and combos; the only thing I feel could have been done better is how the different skill trees are explained. As it stands, only a very basic description is given, when important information, like that hydro spells are in the most part curative or that pyro spells focus more on damage should be explained somewhere. This is not such a major issue due to the fact that players are given the opportunity to respec at any time once they reach a certain point in the story (fairly early) , but still, it does make investing into certain trees a bit dangerous and daunting as a new player.  Overall, the game has provided me with a beautiful experience and I’m left reminiscing about my adventures in Rivellon alongside my memorable companions, thinking about what I could have done differently.  If you have even a passing interest in rpgs, try it, you won’t regret a second of it."

Arsene-Lupin,517,3,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,44.2,"One CRPG to rule them all, one CRPG to inspire them, One CRPG to bring them all and in the darkness enthrall them In the land of Steam where Divinity shall never die.  ....  There are only two things you need to know about Divinity: Original Sin 2.  First, within one week of launch it became the highest-rated games of all time on Metacritic (it currently has a metascore of 95).  Second, all of that critical acclaim is completely deserved.  You see, a very long time ago there was a game called Baldur's Gate 2. It was incredible. An enormous CRPG with engaging combat, compelling characters, and an intriguiing narrative. It demonstrated just how good a roleplaying game could be, and established a standard of quality that would cast a shadow over every subsequent CRPG for decades. For a very long time, we convinved ourselves that Baldur's Gate 2 was an outlier. An abberation. That we would never see another game of similar scope, scale or quality again. And that we were wrong to expect such grand ambitions from even our most beloved of developers.  But we were wrong.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is the game we have been waiting for. It is a spectacular, transcendental experience. Compex, challenging gameplay married to a well-written and extraordinarily dynamic narrative; gorgeous visuals and skilled voice acting; a phenomenal soundtrack and an overall design that grants players an unprecedented level of freedom.  But you know all of this already. Original Sin 2 has already thoroughly enmeshed itself into the zeitgeist. That metascore did not happen by accident, and you know it. The 10,000+ user reviews that are almost exclusively positive are likewise no accident.  This is it. The game that was promised. The game we never thought would come. Divinity Original Sin 2 is, finally, the true successor to Baldur's gate, not because it has a similar style of gameplay, or a similar tone or narrative style, but because of what it represents: a new standard for the genre.  Truly, it is one CRPG fit to rule them all."
Suárez,108,3,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,367.3,"Long story short: this game is as close as a PC RPG can be to tabletop. 9.5/10    In my opinion, Divinity has 3 main selling points: a deep storyline that unfolds as you progress through the main quest and the various sidequests, and that's shaped by your decisions; a complex combat system that looks simpler that it is at first, and that takes a little while to get used to, and brings some refreshing concepts to tactical RPGs; and almost complete freedom given to the player.  Almost every quest, if not all of them, has more than a single outcome, and plenty of different ways to reach those ends. Furthermore, sidequests often overlap and meet each other, which simultaneously deepens the plot and encourages and rewards players for exploring. Frequently, puzzles or obstacles have multiple different solutions available; depending on your playstyle and party configuration, one solution or another may be easier or simpler.  Starting on Act II, you'll have access to free, infinite resets of your characters' atrributes, stats, and talents. This allows for extreme customization and adaptability - if a particular battle is proving to be too difficult, going back and trying a new configuration can be key. It also encourages players to try different combinations of skills. It should be noted that despite what the character creation screen says, there are really no classes in the game - anyone can be anything. The only requirements for equipment are your main stats (Strength, Finesse, Intelligence and Constitution), and for skills, your Ability Points. As long as you have the money to purchase Equipment and Skillbooks, you can customize your characters at will. (A remark: as of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I am not sure if this reset mechanic is available in the last Act. Most likely, I just didn't find it, but it's worth mentioning nonetheless)  On the flipside, the absolute freedom provided by the game can leave you lost at times. I am a very deliberate player and tried to uncover every quest and each corner of the map, and once, on Act II, I found myself facing very tough battles because I was actually supposed to be on the opposite side of the map - I figured this out when I went to said area and enemies were 3 levels lower than my party, which is quite rare in this game and made those battles trivial even on Tactician mode.  Another little complaint: characters with high Wits can find hidden objects in the map. Most of the time, those are hidden treasures you can dig for loot, but sometimes they uncover quest items, like hidden doors, levers or buttons. When those items are uncovered, your character will they spotted something, and the object will glow; but especially in the case of the small buttons, it's not obvious enough where the object is. It can be quite frustrating to spend minutes looking around for a button - I can understand having to do it manually, but if your character already FOUND it, it should be very clearly marked on the map and/or the screen, even more so in the case of plot related objects.  As for bugs, the game is not nearly as bugged as other reviews have made it sound like, although I only bought the game 3 days after release and the developers have been working on patches constantly, so some earlier bugs may have been fixed before I played the game. As of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I only encountered 3 ""serious"" bugs (naturally, they may be fixed already; also, minor spoilers ahead). The first was in Act II - talking to an NPC with may main character cancelled dialogues and interactions with said character permanently. A quick search on Google revealed a fix for this available a little later in the Act, but I simply loaded a save game made a couple of minutes earlier and proceeded as normal, ignoring the buggy NPC. The second was in Act IV; I was unable to complete the Blood Dowry sidequest, as the groom never appeared in his house's basement at all (probably my fault for breaking into his house and looting his stuff before actually realizing it was a quest point). The last bug was just weird and had no game breaking effect (aside from making me lose 2 Action Points in battle). In the final battle, when I used Battle Stomp on the Kraken, my screen switched to what seemed like the corner of the map, switched back, and no damage was dealt, but the Skill was used. Although I must remark that going after the Kraken was not a particularly promising strategy anyway...  (end of spoilers)  To sum it up, the game is fantastic. The dialogues are rich and provided with excellent voice acting, the plot is deep, the combat is fulfilling and the whole experience feels rewarding. A must have if you enjoy the genre."

gerganon,31,3,0,"September 5, 2017",Recommended,474.6,"             This review will cover each aspect of the game and will be updated after full release: sound, gameplay, story, art etc.               Some things can only be understood if you actually experience them, so I won't go into much detail about those amazing things that make this game stand out from anything I have ever played.  The sounds, and music are part of this experience and I can't really describe how calming the sound of waves lapping on the beach is, or how tense the screams of a sadistic tortue chamber changes the atmosphere of the game.  Sound and music are excellent.  Full voice acting for all characters really encases you within the immersiveness of this world.                I've enjoyed 100 hours on the first Original Sin, and 150 hours on the Enhanced Edition, and the gameplay that made that game such a success has only been evolved and molded into a what can only be described as a masterpiece.                  I'll start with the simplest form of gameplay: Combat.  While simple in essence, the amount of possibilities and ways to approach every battle give the combat in this game replayability and makes it never feel monotonous.  You will find yourself planning turns ahead, baiting enemies into a tighter space, saving AP and waiting to spring a trap on them- just for your enemies to do the same to you.  Early access only has access to a ""medium"" difficulty, and as a veteran of the series I can say that while it isn't a walk in the park, it won't require too much out of a well thought out party.  Character planning and preparedness make the difficulty in my opinion, as starting battles differently will show you that a battle that you may have once thought very hard, can become very easy if starting it out thinking outside the box.  Picking up that oil barrel you saw way back, carrying and sneaking it into the middle of an enemy pack, sneaking out, and opening combat with that firescroll you have been saving since the beginning of the game is just one of the many ways you can make the game easier for yourself.                While the game rewards thinking in that aspect, one of my favourite things about this game so far is that it DOESN'T reward you traditionally.  A talent ""Pet-Pal"" will let you talk to animals, and you may expect that every animal you talk to should give you something in return, by nature of spending a hard-earned talent point on the ability.  While sometimes that may be the case, more-often than not you are rewarded with a thought-provoking sentiment from a creature that is just trying to survive in this crazy world.  Consoling and replacing an orphaned bear's parental figure, or trying to explain to a dog what death means won't give you EXP or skills, but will tweak your heart-strings and remind you that there is nothing you can't expect in this world that larian has created.                The story of this game is interesting, as it will be very different depending on who you are playing as, or who you are playing with.  6 Origin characters each have their own goals and will play the game according to their needs.  And even if you aren't playing as them, they will continue throughout the world trying to accomplish their unique goals.  And woe be to those that will stand in their way.  Will you help them or turn them against each other? Or pursuade them to join you?  Or use them to as a means to an end to find better treasure and kill them when their usefulness has run out?  The characters are vastly improved upon the first game and out of everything, this is the part of the game that is the most improved and the most exciting for fans of original sin.                The only thing I can reccommend to players both new and old is that you really try to do EVERYTHING.  If you think it may be possible, just try it out.  What does 10 points in telekenisis and a really heavy object look like over-top of the enemies head?  Sneaking Pacifist playthroughs?  A character that lights everything around them on fire, then has their fire spells reduced in cost because of them standing on fire, and having so much fire-resist that they are healed by standing in it?                  The replayability of this game is insane because there are too many viable options to discover and explore.  The best part about it all is that you can play with 3 other people and do it all together."
Silent Andrew,42,3,0,"February 2, 2017",Recommended,49.5,"This game is a step in the right direction. Its fun because of all the role-playing choices you are able to choose from. 9/10 is what I give this early access game. If you enjoy games like D&D, then this game is a good choice."
Grey Knight,305,3,0,"September 1, 2017",Recommended,69.9,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a great game in early acces already.   ( I will update this review when I've played trough the full release of the game)  The developers are really listening to their community and even ask them what to improve, what to add/remove.  I've not that many hours in it yet since I don't want to play through act 1 yet (which is the early acces part) until I can play the entire story.  Some keyfeatures I like so far are: * Great storytelling * You can interact with ALL npc (and there are a lot of NPC) * Crafting * Wide choice of reactions in conversations * Multipe characters to pick from with their own story line * Split Screen co-op * 4 Player Drop in-out Co-op (multiplayer) * Deep tactical combat * Secret locations and treasures  Upcoming things I'm very excited about are: (these will be added on launch)  * You can play Undead as any race you like(!) * Fully voiceacted game * Skill/Spell crafting   The thing I'm also very excited about (and if you are a DnD player you should be aswell) is the DM mode. This will make it possible for DM's to play their campaigns in this game with: * worldmaps you can pick from a list or upload one yourself. * pick one of the premade playabble area's or even better create one yourself * map editor for Divinity Original Sin 2 * Support for up to 4 players and a DM * And they even have the Lost Mines of Phandelver (DnD starterpack) availible for play on launchday!  So it's clear for me Divinity: Original Sin 2 is already one of the greatest RPG's even though its still in early acces.   If you where not sure if you want to by this game just DO IT you won't regret it! The Dev team deserves it!  "

This game shines where other games just brushes over. From the writing of dialogue to the extreme open endings of each story. Even just looking around will have you waste hours thanks to breathtaking environment.   Where there is good there must be bad. The bad thing about this game is the closer you get to the ending the more you want to start over. Nobody wants this game to end.

Fawlcon,57,3,0,"November 21, 2017",Recommended,"1,430.2","The good:  A very polished game, stunning graphics, voice acting, drop in-out co-op, multiple paths, re-play off the chain.  Game Master is a legitimate contender for Roll20 and like web sites for RPGs. They should try and copy what this game has done, but with more of a D&D rule system.    The bad:  If you like the PC doing the random save versus spells, you will not like the Magic and Physical armor combat.  This is not D&D rules.  Combat will always come down to keeping your armor up while trying to strip the enemies and using a bundle of crowd control to keep them from attacking you. I wish enemies scaled to your level. Example, if you fight hard enemies of superior level early, you will have a great challenge and might have to do multiple re-loads to win…BUT later you go to areas you missed or should have hit earlier and completely walk over the enemies who are of lower level.  The mix:  Once you understand the game mechanics and accept them, you begin to understand how to win battles against superior AI opponents through solid strategy.   The meh: The PC AI is hit or miss.  While there are times the AI does smart counters to your efforts, often it is the AI’s lack of intelligence that allows you to overcome those odds and cheapens the victory.   I can boast that I finished the game and will likely do multiple runs. Second, I have completed a lavish GM campaign that I will post in the workshop, so I have a complete understanding of the game.  Lastly, I’ve been gaming since pong…need I say more?  Final thought:  If you want to experience everything this game has to offer, it would take multiple play throughs…some might see this as good, while others will see it as just too much an investment.  With GM mode I give this game an 9/10, without it an 8."

In the years that followed, theys left behind the dice and paper, moving into the realsm of digital wizardry, and in time they did beget the CRPG.  And it was good. A myriad of beardy, stats heavy mana did fall from heaven, and the faithful feasted on Baldurs Gates, Eyes of the Beholders, Neverwinters, Fallouts and Arx Fatalises.    A great time it was, indeed.  A time when quests could be solved by using your brain rather than murdering everything in sight.  A time when putting points into speech resulted in more than just a boost to bartering. A time when you could convince an endgame boss to kill himself if your stats would allow it.  Alas, a time of great darkness followed, and hither came the likes of Dragon Age 2 and Fallout 4, from whence there was little 'role-playing' and simply 'game' in its stead.  Bethesda and Bioware did cheer as they drowned in coin, but the 'R in the 'RPG' was thought lost forever, and the faithful seemed eternally doomed to walk the path of 'action adventures with skills trees but really you just have to murder everything',   'You don't need any of that old beardy old RPG nonsense' Dragin Age Inquisition cried.  'You need bland worlds of endless icons and fetch-questing between awkward digital sex scenes with elven waifus.  You won't have time for meaningful dialogue choices or stats that effect anything other than combat, not when there are farmers who need you to find lost sheep or villagers who need you to go into the forest and bring back10 rumpleberry leaves'.  All was thought lost...   But hark!  the Bespeckled Ones did hear thine prayer!  'A skill-tree doth not an RPG maketh!' cried Larian, and Divinity Original Sin did emerge from the darkenss, and it was good.  It was bloody good. It giveth from the fruits of meaningful dialogue, choices and actions with consequences, stats and character building that actually matter the game, and it blessed with the freedom to solve problems and quests in any way you could figure out.  And in the later years, Larian did beget Divinity Original Sin 2, and it was even better than the first in almost every way imaginable.  More complex, more engaging, more consequential to the players actions, better written, more co opy then before, just more in everyway!  And the faithful did rejoice! Multiple playthroughs were planned, and marriges and careers thrown to the wayside!  It was the RPG we all wanted...  The Bespeckled Ones have not forsaken us.   (FYI this is just a bit of a laugh.  DOS2 is brilliant - get it)"

Leonhast,414,3,0,"September 22, 2017",Recommended,23.2,"I've played lots of CRPGs. Baldurs Gate (both), Icewind Dale (both), Fallout (all of them), Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Planescape, Tides of Numenara, Tyranny, Wasteland, Pillars of Eternity, Divinity (all of them), Dragon Age (all of them, unfortunately) and more and more and more. This is one of the best of them. Great setting, different enough to be interesting, but not too strange ... you can identify with story and characters ... oh, yes, interesting characters, too. Combat makes great use of abilities and environment. It can be tough but that's part of the fun for me. I think also that it might have a lot of replayability because you can choose a number of different Origin characters who seem to get slightly different story arcs.  Story ... for my taste way better than Original Sin 1 (same goes for most quests). Can't wait to learn more.  Voice acting (Larian originally did not plan to do it) is a great addition and adds a lot to the game. I backed this game on Kickstarter, it was a no-brainer because Larian did great work with Original Sin 1 and is simply a great company, very much in touch with their fans and customers.  Great company, gem of a game and to top it of: an editor. Looks like this game will keep me busy a long time and I'm having a blast. 10 out of 10 at the moment, I have not finished it yet (actually, it took me over 11 hours to get out of Fort Joy, the ""starting area"")."

Le Loup-garou,411,3,0,"November 5, 2017",Recommended,53.0,"Usually I find that a lot of games that try to fully emulate D&D mechanics suck. There are several exceptions obviously and many fantasy games have some charcteristics taken from D&D even if only minor ones.  This is D&D the video game. You CANNOT get closer without playing D&D or a similar table top with a group of friends. There is even multiplayer, which is amazing. This game is excellent and so story rich it is hard not to get totally absorbed, There is really only one progression path it seems in the main quest set but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.   I suggest playing a charcter with an orgin story as they provide a more immersive experience, and intrestting dialogue options in some situations. I haven't taken the time to use the Dungeon master mode but from what I've seen it makes game play essentially endless if full utilized. I'm not that creative but I'm sure someone is!"

Baldurs Gate (both), Icewind Dale (both), Fallout (all of them), Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Planescape, Tides of Numenara, Tyranny, Wasteland, Pillars of Eternity, Divinity (all of them), Dragon Age (all of them, unfortunately) and more and more and more. This is one of the best of them. Great setting, different enough to be interesting, but not too strange ... you can identify with story and characters ... oh, yes, interesting characters, too. Combat makes great use of abilities and environment. It can be tough but that's part of the fun for me. I think also that it might have a lot of replayability because you can choose a number of different Origin characters who seem to get slightly different story arcs.  Story ... for my taste way better than Original Sin 1 (same goes for most quests). Can't wait to learn more.  Voice acting (Larian originally did not plan to do it) is a great addition and adds a lot to the game. I backed this game on Kickstarter, it was a no-brainer because Larian did great work with Original Sin 1 and is simply a great company, very much in touch with their fans and customers.  Great company, gem of a game and to top it of: an editor. Looks like this game will keep me busy a long time and I'm having a blast. 10 out of 10 at the moment, I have not finished it yet (actually, it took me over 11 hours to get out of Fort Joy, the ""starting area"")."

The atmosphere of the game is somewhat dark, but humorous at times with a sprinkle of childlike light themes. Has lovable, charming, but yet believable characters. The combat and all questing is never boring.  The game has been a real sense of accomplishment playing through it, it's so much fun to play with friends, so I'd really recommend this as a co-op game. However, playing solo is also very fun. All other games since I bought D:OS 2 have been outclassed by it in sense of enjoyment for me.  Not a short game either with all the mod capabilities, and I've played about halfway through the story in about 122 hours and I've still so much more to explore in the game.  Would really recommend - best RPG experience I've had."
Rhedin,154,3,0,April 25,Recommended,87.1,"I absolutely recommend this game.  It plays like a classic RPG with turn based combat, action economy, skills, spells, multiple ways to build your characters, even multi classing and having it have drop in drop out 4 player cooperative is a very nice feature, can even be modded to have larger parties though you will unbalance the game for yourself and disable achievements. The in game lore and stories play well from one arc to the next and the scenes in which they are set are beautiful.  My only complaints about this game would be the lack of interesting none human player races, though the lizard folk are really nicely designed.  The fact you can move far enough away from active combat (sometimes) to leave combat and thus get infinite and free action economy whilst the rest of your team is playing turn by turn."

Le Loup-garou,411,3,0,"November 5, 2017",Recommended,53.0,"Usually I find that a lot of games that try to fully emulate D&D mechanics suck. There are several exceptions obviously and many fantasy games have some charcteristics taken from D&D even if only minor ones.  This is D&D the video game. You CANNOT get closer without playing D&D or a similar table top with a group of friends. There is even multiplayer, which is amazing. This game is excellent and so story rich it is hard not to get totally absorbed, There is really only one progression path it seems in the main quest set but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.   I suggest playing a charcter with an orgin story as they provide a more immersive experience, and intrestting dialogue options in some situations. I haven't taken the time to use the Dungeon master mode but from what I've seen it makes game play essentially endless if full utilized. I'm not that creative but I'm sure someone is!"
zanos,300,3,0,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,102.0,"Wow, where do I begin...  This game harkens back to a time long past, a time of unforgiving games that don't hold your hand,  and offers you pithy clues to make your way through a vast uncompromising land replete with challenging combat, the odd puzzle, and a myriad of ways to deal with a situation rather than selecting an option through a chat box.   There were so many instances during my playthrough where I felt like I was breaking quests only to see them to completion in ways that would have involved a reload in others.  It's a game that stands on some firm philosophical foundations: questioning the nature of power, the idea of power corrupting or the good that can be done if consolidated. It explores the nature of institutions in a world gone awry, exemplifying the idea that the road to hell is most certainly paved with good intentions. The moral dilemmas are many, and in an almost Witcheresque fashion, the consequences of actions taken often come with a cost.  That being said, Larian is able to balance the seriousness of the subject with the humor, sarcasm, and satire that they are known for and given the gravity of the events unfolding, the humor adds an extra dimension to the game.  The combat is as challenging as you want it to be. I don't mean in terms of a difficulty slider, I mean in terms of scouring the forums for optimal builds or cheesing for gold to get the best possible equipment. I don't condemn either, I found it rather refreshing that the satisfaction of combat is as customizable as you want it to be depending on how one chooses to engage in a situation. Do you use environmental barrels? Reposition before engaging the situation? Run in and make do? Some of these will work, others will not, but what is interesting is that the solutions to these situations are many and are at the discretion of the player.  The companions you can choose all have excellent backgrounds, some more interesting than others, but all of them were noteworthy. What is also interesting about it is that they are not just there for you, like in most RPGs, they have their own ambitions, goals, and desires and often time going at odds with them could cost you a slot on your roster.   The quests and the world itself are amazing, especially the latter. It's not perfect, and you can clearly see some additional attention was given to certain areas of the game over others, but the different areas, the choices made, and consequences really strengthen the overall story and your journey from a prisoner in Fort Joy to its aftermath.   The quests, in typical Larian fashion, run the gamut. They vary from discovering a serial killer to the occasional rescue to providing an item or eliminating a threat. They are pretty standard fare, but what is interesting is how many different ways you can handle them and the consequences of handling them in the way that you do. There have been bugs with journal entries, and sometimes quests can seem rather baffling, but I didn't really let that upset me. I have no doubt that in the coming months they will be fixed and tightened up. But yeah, to some, and to me at times, it was frustrating.  All in all, this was an excellent game. Perhaps that isn't the right word, it was better than excellent. It was not without its faults, but I really got a lot out of it, from the story, to the challenging combat, the voice acting, the perks and quirks of communing with animals, the different ways to tackle each situation and even the soundtrack. It's a tightly knit rich and rewarding game that you savor long after it ends and even into the beginning of the next playthrough.    If you like CRPGs, you will most likely really see this as a worthy successor to the Fallout 2 style of CRPGs. People have been comparing it to Baldur's Gate 2, and, in terms of the story, companions, and the epic nature of the experience, you can definitely draw comparisons, but the combat is firmly rooted in the Fallout 2 or Temple of Elemental Evil tradition.  So, yeah, Larian does it again, even better than before. I expected a good game, even a great game, but I was not expecting this. It will be penned into the great book of RPG goodness that it deserves. Larian firmly deserves every bit of success they get from this title.   They have stolen the divinity from the former greats and it is perhaps only contested for the crown, in my opinion, by CDPR. Obsidian is also up there, but POE, even in all of its greatness, failed to evoke the same feelings that I had for this. It really filled the void left for me by the Witcher 3, and for those of you that know what I'm talking about and perhaps for those of you reading these reviews to see if it's a worthwhile purchase...it is.  Good luck in your future endeavors Larian, I, for one, will be there to continue to back your projects henceforth, bien fait."
Suárez,108,3,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,367.3,"Long story short: this game is as close as a PC RPG can be to tabletop. 9.5/10    In my opinion, Divinity has 3 main selling points: a deep storyline that unfolds as you progress through the main quest and the various sidequests, and that's shaped by your decisions; a complex combat system that looks simpler that it is at first, and that takes a little while to get used to, and brings some refreshing concepts to tactical RPGs; and almost complete freedom given to the player.  Almost every quest, if not all of them, has more than a single outcome, and plenty of different ways to reach those ends. Furthermore, sidequests often overlap and meet each other, which simultaneously deepens the plot and encourages and rewards players for exploring. Frequently, puzzles or obstacles have multiple different solutions available; depending on your playstyle and party configuration, one solution or another may be easier or simpler.  Starting on Act II, you'll have access to free, infinite resets of your characters' atrributes, stats, and talents. This allows for extreme customization and adaptability - if a particular battle is proving to be too difficult, going back and trying a new configuration can be key. It also encourages players to try different combinations of skills. It should be noted that despite what the character creation screen says, there are really no classes in the game - anyone can be anything. The only requirements for equipment are your main stats (Strength, Finesse, Intelligence and Constitution), and for skills, your Ability Points. As long as you have the money to purchase Equipment and Skillbooks, you can customize your characters at will. (A remark: as of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I am not sure if this reset mechanic is available in the last Act. Most likely, I just didn't find it, but it's worth mentioning nonetheless)  On the flipside, the absolute freedom provided by the game can leave you lost at times. I am a very deliberate player and tried to uncover every quest and each corner of the map, and once, on Act II, I found myself facing very tough battles because I was actually supposed to be on the opposite side of the map - I figured this out when I went to said area and enemies were 3 levels lower than my party, which is quite rare in this game and made those battles trivial even on Tactician mode.  Another little complaint: characters with high Wits can find hidden objects in the map. Most of the time, those are hidden treasures you can dig for loot, but sometimes they uncover quest items, like hidden doors, levers or buttons. When those items are uncovered, your character will they spotted something, and the object will glow; but especially in the case of the small buttons, it's not obvious enough where the object is. It can be quite frustrating to spend minutes looking around for a button - I can understand having to do it manually, but if your character already FOUND it, it should be very clearly marked on the map and/or the screen, even more so in the case of plot related objects.  As for bugs, the game is not nearly as bugged as other reviews have made it sound like, although I only bought the game 3 days after release and the developers have been working on patches constantly, so some earlier bugs may have been fixed before I played the game. As of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I only encountered 3 ""serious"" bugs (naturally, they may be fixed already; also, minor spoilers ahead). The first was in Act II - talking to an NPC with may main character cancelled dialogues and interactions with said character permanently. A quick search on Google revealed a fix for this available a little later in the Act, but I simply loaded a save game made a couple of minutes earlier and proceeded as normal, ignoring the buggy NPC. The second was in Act IV; I was unable to complete the Blood Dowry sidequest, as the groom never appeared in his house's basement at all (probably my fault for breaking into his house and looting his stuff before actually realizing it was a quest point). The last bug was just weird and had no game breaking effect (aside from making me lose 2 Action Points in battle). In the final battle, when I used Battle Stomp on the Kraken, my screen switched to what seemed like the corner of the map, switched back, and no damage was dealt, but the Skill was used. Although I must remark that going after the Kraken was not a particularly promising strategy anyway...  (end of spoilers)  To sum it up, the game is fantastic. The dialogues are rich and provided with excellent voice acting, the plot is deep, the combat is fulfilling and the whole experience feels rewarding. A must have if you enjoy the genre."

JaneDutohlav[TA],629,3,0,"November 26, 2017",Recommended,185.8,"This game is an awesome rpg co-op experience with your friends. It's even better than expected. I'd definitely recommend hard difficulty for experienced tactical players. On the other hand, the story pulls you in. There are a lot of side quests, puzzles, and mysteries as well.    At the beginning were the predefined characters not that interesting to me, but with time they grew to my heart. And seriously, every single NPC dubbed? With branching conversations? That's every rpg player's dream come true. So be prepared to read a lot too. Or not, that's up to you.    Combat? Feels very fluent and very similar to a combat from the first game. But now some skills can be better combined and create a potential for your cunning. For example: with Hydrosophist and Necromancer you can make Raining Blood - which creates blood surfaces, sets bleeding on enemies and douses fire surfaces - and those blood surfaces you can further electrify or freeze, or simply walk on it with blood sucker for some healing.   Music? Masterpiece by Borislav Slavov.  TL;DR: Like fantasy RPG and tactics? Get your best friends/partners and get it right now! "

Tucan,668,3,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,69.4," Scroll to bottom for summary    To start off, I just want to say that I am really enjoying this game quite a bit. I never played the first one and I decided to take a risk for myself by purchasing this because I have not played many turn-based strategy games that I truly enjoyed/got addicted to in the past.  However  this game has me hooked and at the moment I can't think of hardly any reasons as to why I would stop playing it any time soon.    Ok, but why?    Admittedly this game is definitely not for everyone but hopefully this next part will be helpful to someone who is on the fence about it.    You will likely enjoy this game if you...	  (note: These lists are ordered from the most to least impactful on the experience of the game in each category)   Typically enjoy...     ...combat  	  Turn-Based     Strategy     Co-Op     Party-Based     Tactical  Typically enjoy...     ...Genres	  RPG     Adventure     Fantasy     Open-World  Typically enjoy...     ...Styles/Design Choices	  Story Rich     Character Customization     Atmospheric     Great Soundtrack     Click-to-Move     Isometric/Top-Down (Toggleable by player) If you don't fit into any of the items above then this game probably isn't for you but I would still reccomend that you consider purchasing because as I said earlier, I very rarely enjoy Turn-based strategy games but currently I am enjoying this game a lot.  If based on the things mentioned above you think that you  will  like this game, then below is a list of pros & cons.     Pros  (not in any particular order)     In-Depth Character Customization	 (can be re-customized fairly simply without restarting from the beginging of the game)   Very well polished/detailed level design   Engaging and detailed story	  Vibrant atmospheric environments that each have unique characteristics and/or interesting areas to explore	  Great soundtrack that fits the environments very well	  Multiple ways to solve problems/complete quests	  Rarely uses HUD elements to display your objective (immersive)	  (instead of showing your current objective(s) with the HUD, your quests and assignments are told directly to your character by someone you must find and interact with then your objective is writen down in the journal)   Great NPC character voice acting	  Combat system has a very enjoyable amount of depth and skill required to fully master	  Ability to interact with nearly every item/NPC in the game	  It's very easy to just start playing a co-op game and have fun	  Good veriety of enemies, none of the enemies get overused to the point that they feel repetitive	  High resolution textures and shadows to compliment the beautiful variety of environments	  Cons  (likely that some of these are bugs that will be patched later)     Movement is not as elegant and simple as it could be	 (holding mouse1 or panning to the desired location and clicking)   Using the mouse to pan or rotate the camera is jittery and hard to look at even at very high frame rates	  Friendly AI in combat is poor and can make rescuing a friendly NPC in order to complete a quest feel more like a fight against the game and less like a combat scenario   	  Since there are sometimes very few hints as to where you need to go or who you need to talk to in order to complete a quest it can be frustrating to search an area for an extended period of time simply to complete one objective	  Occasional frame drops or inconsistency of frame times / frame rate in certain areas	  Party members sometimes do not move when the leader is moving until you select a different party member to lead, most commonly when changing elevation via a ladder or vine that leads to a part of the level that is currently on-screen	  Summary:	Divinity: Original Sin 2 can provide countless hours of questing, exploring, adventuring, and monster hunting in it's beautifully designed and expansive open-world with countless areas and secrets to find throughout the entire experience which is glued together by a phenomenal soundtrack and wrapped in a cozy blanket of extrodinary storytelling.   Story     10/10   Graphics     9/10   Gameplay     8/10   Sountrack     10/10   OVERALL 92/100  An absolutely amazing game but I had to take a few points off points for the bothersome movement controls and the friendly AI that tries to kill itself when you are trying to save it."

gerganon,31,3,0,"September 5, 2017",Recommended,474.6,"             This review will cover each aspect of the game and will be updated after full release: sound, gameplay, story, art etc.               Some things can only be understood if you actually experience them, so I won't go into much detail about those amazing things that make this game stand out from anything I have ever played.  The sounds, and music are part of this experience and I can't really describe how calming the sound of waves lapping on the beach is, or how tense the screams of a sadistic tortue chamber changes the atmosphere of the game.  Sound and music are excellent.  Full voice acting for all characters really encases you within the immersiveness of this world.                I've enjoyed 100 hours on the first Original Sin, and 150 hours on the Enhanced Edition, and the gameplay that made that game such a success has only been evolved and molded into a what can only be described as a masterpiece.                  I'll start with the simplest form of gameplay: Combat.  While simple in essence, the amount of possibilities and ways to approach every battle give the combat in this game replayability and makes it never feel monotonous.  You will find yourself planning turns ahead, baiting enemies into a tighter space, saving AP and waiting to spring a trap on them- just for your enemies to do the same to you.  Early access only has access to a ""medium"" difficulty, and as a veteran of the series I can say that while it isn't a walk in the park, it won't require too much out of a well thought out party.  Character planning and preparedness make the difficulty in my opinion, as starting battles differently will show you that a battle that you may have once thought very hard, can become very easy if starting it out thinking outside the box.  Picking up that oil barrel you saw way back, carrying and sneaking it into the middle of an enemy pack, sneaking out, and opening combat with that firescroll you have been saving since the beginning of the game is just one of the many ways you can make the game easier for yourself.                While the game rewards thinking in that aspect, one of my favourite things about this game so far is that it DOESN'T reward you traditionally.  A talent ""Pet-Pal"" will let you talk to animals, and you may expect that every animal you talk to should give you something in return, by nature of spending a hard-earned talent point on the ability.  While sometimes that may be the case, more-often than not you are rewarded with a thought-provoking sentiment from a creature that is just trying to survive in this crazy world.  Consoling and replacing an orphaned bear's parental figure, or trying to explain to a dog what death means won't give you EXP or skills, but will tweak your heart-strings and remind you that there is nothing you can't expect in this world that larian has created.                The story of this game is interesting, as it will be very different depending on who you are playing as, or who you are playing with.  6 Origin characters each have their own goals and will play the game according to their needs.  And even if you aren't playing as them, they will continue throughout the world trying to accomplish their unique goals.  And woe be to those that will stand in their way.  Will you help them or turn them against each other? Or pursuade them to join you?  Or use them to as a means to an end to find better treasure and kill them when their usefulness has run out?  The characters are vastly improved upon the first game and out of everything, this is the part of the game that is the most improved and the most exciting for fans of original sin.                The only thing I can reccommend to players both new and old is that you really try to do EVERYTHING.  If you think it may be possible, just try it out.  What does 10 points in telekenisis and a really heavy object look like over-top of the enemies head?  Sneaking Pacifist playthroughs?  A character that lights everything around them on fire, then has their fire spells reduced in cost because of them standing on fire, and having so much fire-resist that they are healed by standing in it?                  The replayability of this game is insane because there are too many viable options to discover and explore.  The best part about it all is that you can play with 3 other people and do it all together."

It's a little pull back when I know I can't have all 6 people in the party, but a mod in the workshop solves that! Anyhow this game is worth every dollar I spent and I did not regret get it on the day it was out! Even the gameplay style - turn based gameplay is suit my liking! This is a must buy game if you like fascinating story, interesting character and their interaction and of course the turn based gameplay style!"

Its simple enough to jump in even if you are quite new to these sort of games but make no mistake, there is very little hand holding in this masterpiece.

This game is absoltley brillant in ways it gives you freedom to approach to given situation in any way you can think of and still manages to keep everything story driven. Nothing ever feels misplaced in the world... the level of detail, it rivals the likes of Witcher 3 and Breath of the Wild. The combat is tough but fair and it rewards tactical thinking.. keep a stock of Oil Barrels for boss fight :)  And the music... well, I am listening to it on a loop while staring at the download progress of the update for the last two hours, so yea its pretty darn good."

Fire is eternal, just get use to the burn damage  Editing this review to be more serious and to encourage others to play this, but there is honestly no words to convey what is simply an actual work of art graphically, mechanically, art and graphically, character and storywise.  Sit in the mainmenu and let the opening theme drag you into the mood of the game. Start a fight and let the orchestra rise and hype you to fight dragons and demons, or a fistfight in a tavern gets even more roudy with the mixture of brass and string. start the character screen and listen to the origin stories of all the characters for your first game,  listening to the fully voiced professional voice actors lay the background for the Characters own subplots that string along with the main game(Lohse is awesome as is the Red Prince).  Start your game and enjoy every view, walk along beaches of ruined castles, explore though caves with ancient unknown ruins, walk through the massive capital of Rivellon And just get wrapped up as the story twists and turns its way through the mythical land of rivelon for almost 120 hours of straight story that i honestly lost track of time playing (alot of my time was spent playing offline) And the best part? Do it all again and its just as good. Me and 3 friends all made custom characters and we are doing it all again and its just as fun as when we first started, the game was made for the party of 4 aspect like a good D&D game with your best friends after school.  Even if the main story wears you out, the game offers a well thought out editor to make your own maps and campaigns to really bring that D&D experience back, or download a top rated campaign from the workshop, all while playing the soundtrack back on youtube on a playlist because that full orchestra really gets me  Normally games in the 40-50 price range turn me around but this game really shines in a time of half completed main industry titles and half♥♥♥♥♥♥♥resells of RPGs, this game will bring back that experience of the golden age of game design when games were meant to be played and not sold. It deserves its overwhelmingly positive score, its nomination for RPG of the year despite being a PC only title as i was just that much loved by those who played it, and it deserves more people to play and love it just as me and my friends have. This Divinity title will remain special to me, and in my eyes made Game of the Year 2017"
Roger Feederer,204,3,0,"November 12, 2017",Recommended,42.8,"The true game of the year in 2017.  Hopefully the steam review system/tagging system gets this game to pop up on your store, because you probably won't hear about it from major outlets or podcasts.  I honestly thought turn based strategy had gone the way of XCOM.  Divinity, however, can be more readily compared to Dragon Age: Origins...only with more story, more character customization, interesting party members and fun yet challenging combat.  There's no need to experience any of the previous games (I didn't).  If you have ever enjoyed RPGs then play this game."

RainyDay,121,3,0,March 31,Recommended,129.6,"An absolutely incredible experience, without a doubt, one of the finest rpgs to date, it certainly is the best I’ve ever played.  I wouldn’t know where to begin, the world is as interesting and alive as the long and beautifully crafted story, which stays strong for almost all of its entire 130h runtime.  If you’re new to rpgs, you might be put off by the inherent amount of lore and world building exposition these kinds of games often exhibit, but I must say that the game does a remarkable job of giving you all the information you need without overwhelming you. The world building is constant and just detailed enough as to make you want to fill in the details yourself using your own imagination.  Having not played the original Divinity Original Sin, I did not once feel like I was missing some important piece of lore or that I had missed out on anything story-wise, which is something I truly appreciate from the developers.  The writing is witty, fresh and fully voice acted. Not one person, monster or animal goes without a voice. The voice acting is also excellent, a pleasant surprise seeing how much has been had to be dubbed.  Combat is a lot of fun, and it only gets better the more you level up and are able to experiment with new interesting skills and combos; the only thing I feel could have been done better is how the different skill trees are explained. As it stands, only a very basic description is given, when important information, like that hydro spells are in the most part curative or that pyro spells focus more on damage should be explained somewhere. This is not such a major issue due to the fact that players are given the opportunity to respec at any time once they reach a certain point in the story (fairly early) , but still, it does make investing into certain trees a bit dangerous and daunting as a new player.  Overall, the game has provided me with a beautiful experience and I’m left reminiscing about my adventures in Rivellon alongside my memorable companions, thinking about what I could have done differently.  If you have even a passing interest in rpgs, try it, you won’t regret a second of it."

The world is detailed both in environment and lore, the characters are deep and nuanced, often troubled and frequently broken, yet richer for their vast flaws. The combat is pure turn based strategy, and while cheesable, can be quite difficult while rewarding smart tactics.  The story is enthralling, as are each of the dozens of side stories. I'm hesitant to label them quests, as I feel that would demean their stature in some way.  Finally, the sound track is amazing. So good in fact, that it won't stop playing on loop in my head, even when I wish it would because I've been up for 46 hours and please let me sleep.  10/10, will play again once I can convince a friend to get the game for a co-op playthrough."

IamKayoh,309,3,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,126.5,"This is the first review I'm writing for a video game on Steam in several thousands of hours logged across many titles. If you enjoy Pathfinder/DnD. Get this. Get it with a buddy if you can and you both go in blind. That's what I did and it has been the best gaming experience I have had since being a kid. I've audibly gasped, I've giggled like a kid. I've had some Ah ha! and some oh♥♥♥♥♥♥... I want to include a small example as to why this game is an absolute must have and why it's so incredible to play with a friend.   Whatever you do, don't read any guides. Get lost, explore. Find neat♥♥♥♥♥♥ Don't worry about your build or misspending points. I'm only level 7 on several play throughs but I have already mutated builds so suddenly in just a level or two it's not worth playing through the boat twenty times.   If you are planning on playing Divinity II do not read the next part. If you're on the fence, read the next part.     ****SMALL SPOILER AHEAD*****   There is a side quest early in the game involving what appears to be an undead/zombie man on a beach. My party decided to kill him before attempting anything else and we ended up with this sweet ring. The problem was, this ring belonged to a person that a Magister was looking for. Well♥♥♥♥♥♥ let's go talk to her and let her know this guy is dead. So we go talk to the Magister. Turns out this guy is her father. We tell her he's dead and looked super nasty. She asks for proof and the only proof we have is this ♥♥♥♥ing guys ring.   Let me pause for a moment. For this early on, this ring is like a ♥♥♥♥ing cheat code. It gives magic armor, some other stat, but the big thing is that is let's the user cast restoration.   So the only way to advance the quest is to give her the ring, otherwise she thinks you're ♥♥♥♥ing with her to get her to leave her post. We decide we wanna see the event through, so I give up my precious and we follow her back to the beach where this Magister is losing her mind and crying over her undead (now dead) father's corpse. Clearly she's distraught, but I want that ♥♥♥♥ing ring. She's not gonna give it up, it's her Dad's ring and he's ♥♥♥♥ing dead and corrupted in front of her.  After getting caught attempting to pickpocket the ring which I still maintain is what literally every rogue-ish character would do in this situation, me and my friend found ourselves in combat with a Magister. My friend who has taken a starting level in necromancer starts laughing uncontrollably and we both watch as his little Dwarf named Opal raises the Magister's fathers body into a grotesque pile of gore, and then slaps the now distraught Magister in the face with her (un)undead father's intestines which then exploded into a cloud of viscera and splooge.   Seriously, get this game, get off the boat, and start exploring. Get creative, there's a lot you can do and many ways to do it.    "
TrumpKingsly,149,3,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,136.4,"This is an extremely deep, extremely interesting RPG (gameplay and narrative) that doesn't know how combat works and rushes the everloving Hell out of its ending.  The Narrative is Easily the Best Part of this Game The narrative is about power and servitude. A movie would typically tackle this subject using a protagonist and an antagonist in a singular case study. We'd form some kind of opinion on it after seing what goes down between those two people. Original Sin 2 is a 100+ hour videogame that tackles the subject using many protags and antags in many separate and different case studies and thought experiments. This means we form our opinion after seeing the power/servitude dynamic play out in a bunch of different contexts. It's really effective at helping the player form a rich opinion, by the time it's done.  But Combat and the Ending are Serious Sore Spots However, there are two jagged thorns stuck deep within the side of this game: combat difficulty and the story's ending. These thorns are so jagged, in fact, that I have a major doubt: the review outlets giving this a 10/10 probably didn't finish the game and probably played it on easy mode.  Combat encounters are each either so easy that none of your party even lose their armor, or they're actually impossible to win. There is no middle ground. When they're impossible, this is because the game cheats on behalf of your enemies. They get an astounding number of action points in a turn. They cast the same AoE decimator spell every single turn. They mind control your party through their magic armor. They're a mob, each member of which has infinite initiative, so they all go before your first party member has their turn. Or you make a certain ludicrous decision at the end game and you're faced with a 1v10 that gives you one move to kill everyone. Hilarious.  To win these impossible fights, you have to cheat. Save scum, obviously. But, beyond that, you have to reload, then position your party as if they're psychics--in ways you could not possibly have known would work before going into the fight the first time. Or, you have to destroy parts of the environment before stepping on that tile that triggers the fight. Or, you have to kill all the nurses in the Doctor's house before you go and talk to him. Cheat at this game. Become a save-scum psychic and leave your foes baffled at your god-like foresight.  And then there's the ending. The gameplay leading to the end is pretty cool. Some complicated puzzles, most of which are literally spelled out for you if you talk to everyone in the final zone. But at least one puzzle will remain unspoiled until you have to complete it.  Then, you get a huge boss fight full of cheating enemies that you win by the skin of your teeth. Almost all of those enemies are, as far as I can tell, the biggest narrative inconsistency in history. Then, the narrator gives you some boilerplate about ""remember all that stuff that happened in the game."" That is just barely a paraphrase of what he says. Character- and decision-specificity are at absolute 0 in that boilerplate. Then, he asks ""Remembering that stuff, what do you do?"" You pick one of three choices. I picked the first choice. ""Okay, so you picked the first choice. Now you get this thing. What do you do with it?"" Three more choices. You pick one and get 30-60 seconds of post-game cutscene featuring some vagary about a character that really didn't matter and an extremely brief summary of the way things stand after your decision.  And then you're done. Recently, Larian enabled playing after the endgame, so you're brought back to your base to finish side quests or otherwise derp about with your endgame loot. Here's the thing, though. 3/4 of my party died during the last fight. Never got a chance to res anyone. One of that 3/4 was the character I created at the start. So, another party member won the game. Only my created character goes back to base after the credits, and guess what? He's still dead, so I get a game over screen and am asked to reload the boss fight.  Nice.  Conclusion This game is extremely good. Addictive, even. It stands tall and proud above most other story-driven games I've ever played. Then, there are the ""challenging"" fights and the sloppy, heartless ending that easily hack off its legs at the knees. Overall, I recommend, because 125/126 hours being fantastic is a great thing. But, that hour of poor quality is a really, super important hour."

Tatterwing,182,3,0,"October 28, 2017",Recommended,187.4,"I am positively enthralled by the rich and vibrant lore that the dev team has created for this continuation of the Divinity series!  The mechanics and class creation have created an absolute eden of possibilities, while the world surrounding you ~ dark and treacherous ~ has such a wonderful and vast open canvas of opportunity."
seanhogge,93,3,0,January 19,Recommended,97.6,"So you already know the game is good. Very positive reviews overall and recently. The devs are responsive and sensitive to the players, and it's one of the few Kickstarter projects that didn't seem to fall apart or leave everyone underwhelmed.  What I'd like to do is help you figure out what will leave you perfectly whelmed with this game.  TL;DR? It's tough to get into. I failed the first time. Experiment and mod, and you'll have a blast. The game won't keep you from fights way too tough for you. Just learn caution.  I started it maybe 18 months ago, got to the first town and quit in sort-of frustration. I had approached it all wrong. Maybe I can help others avoid the mistake. Here's what you'll need to know, I think.  This is a game of thought. The action is visceral and fun and frequent (unless you prefer it not to be), but even then you'll be most successful when you are deliberate and creative. Don't expect Dragon Age, this is more complex. Battles aren't about the amount of damage, they're about doing the right damage at the right time. You can see the action order, you can see weaknesses, you can chain things together.  The game is a challenge. Levels are significant. 4 level 10s vs 3 level 11s can be a genuinely tough fight when you're still learning mechanics and combos. Quicksave a lot. Just. Like, constantly. Trust me. It's exhilarating that any encounter can go either way, but you can easily get caught with your skivvies in the static cloud.  Don't be afraid to mod, even on your first play through. I came back after a few mods eased some annoyances and made the game slightly easier, but still a challenge. Just do whatever you need to experience the game, and don't listen to the magisters purists. The strength here is in the play, not the mechanical experience.  You can completely respec at any time, starting in Act 2. No mods needed, total freedom to move all your points. The only thing downside is that you'll have to spend money on skills if you go in a new direction. But even in Act 1, don't fret about getting every level-up right. Try wacky things.  Crafting isn't a chore. Once you know a recipe, you can just make it if you have the stuff. You can experiment like a graveyard debtor without penalty. You can ignore crafting altogether.  Leveling up, getting new equipment, and getting new skills all make an impact. All of them happen often enough that I feel like I'm more powerful in almost every fight. A single level opens up many new options. A new weapon is usually around the corner. A new skill is about to be revealed. Relish it, rookie.  Choices make a difference, not in a superficial way. But there's always a way around. Almost. If there isn't, then that's why you and I will have to play through again. I'm only in Act 2, but I already have a half-dozen things I'd like to see go a different way.  You can make mistakes. I killed a guy I needed because he got♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥that I kept asking the same question. So then I had to work around it. It was great. The devs have you, you can't get yourself into an unbeatable state, but ain't no one gonna slay the voidwoken in the closet for you. Also, if you have an undead, always check their coverings or disguise. Just sayin'. Poor townspersons.  Do you like ""gaming the game?"" Figuring out what's overpowered and exploiting it? Go for it! Me, I think that's as boring as a turtle's unrequited love laments, so if you're like me don't read a thing about min-maxing or party makeup. Just pick what you like and you can make it work and the work to do so won't be so bad because it's fun.  If you expect Diablo or Dragon Age, a one-best-way game or mindless distraction, this isn't it. I dig all of those, but this game isn't what I play to scratch those itches.  Oh, and teleport is a crazy useful skill. Make sure at least 1 person has it. FIN."

This game is a must, it is plain wonderful on all aspects. I cannot possibly imagine the amount of hours it took to fully design and develop this masterpiece. It is one of those games on Steam that put the others to shame. Can be enjoyed immensely alone and with friends. The music is out of this world."
RedZane,188,3,0,"November 7, 2017",Recommended,503.8,Never done a review but this game has rightfully earned a lot of praise.   I have played through the game entirely on tactian mode and can say this game has earned every bit of praise that people have put. I have spent (probably too many) hours on building a brand new character and running through a good portion on Fort Joy. The whole storyline is a amazing and the interactions between party members is on point.   The only complaint I have is that NPC's treat Fane as human until combat where the begin raining healing spells to his face as if they knew he was undead. Not a huge gripe and something you can generally ignore.

Its simple enough to jump in even if you are quite new to these sort of games but make no mistake, there is very little hand holding in this masterpiece.

Nurse,650,3,0,January 15,Recommended,125.0,"My personal Review to Divinity: Original Sin 2 So, lets get this straight, this game is a master-piece.   It's a game like XCOM: Enemy Unkown its a game like The Witcher its a game like Dragon Age and many more...  Divinity is not for everyone, but it is for everyone who loves MMO/RPG/TBG Turn based game I try to be spoiler free, but i will include stuff in this review that is obvious.  Character Editor There are a few thing's that i want to talk about, mostly good. You can create your own char in this game, and it's not only for the look, it changes the gameplay for the entire game. There are a few races, Human's, Lizard's, Drawf's, Skeleton's, Elf's... Every Race has a unique talent, example: Elf's can eat body Part's and know what happened to them or what they thought about while they died, sound strange? Yes it is. But it help's you in-game to find hidden treasures or hidden quest's. Even the NPC's are reacting to your Gender/Race/Behavior.  You can choose your own Style, i dont mean hair, face, etc. i mean... how your char is reacting to things... example: I mad a Noble Lizard, that talk's like it has a stick up her♥♥♥♥♥♥ I role-play her like she is a Annoying know-it-all.  This way, your story takes different out comes. So watch out what you pick.  The only thing that bugs me is, that i cant change how tall my char is, how the body looks... Also, some gear looks weird on the body of the chars, they look more fat in some of these, and some are way to skimpy.  There are also many trait's and Skills you can pick but thats too much to go in to... You just need to know one think... there is everything from the normal knight to cleric.  This might be a spoiler for an enemy in the game: Some races has permanent side effects.. like skeletons heal when they get poison damage, same with enemys Martin Looter King What can i say? There is a♥♥♥♥♥♥tone of loot... i dont know how much and how different they are, but what i saw so far... simply -amazing-  I just noticed, here and there, some clothing and loot looks the same... different item stats, but what will you do with a such big game?  The Trading is very simple to use, easy to access, quick to understand.   Enemy's you face NPC's Sadly, this is the only point i am slighty disappointed, its not bad for me, but i think some people might notice very quickly, that there are not that many different enemy types. Yes there are plenty, but for the length of this game, it might get boring. I dont mean the fights, i mean the types, i go to the fights after this section...  Oh boy... the NPC's... Where do i start? Simply put, they all are very good written, +1 to the writer's. They never get boring, it feels like every NPC has a story... also, they all are voiced, but sometimes here and there, they dont speak, mostly for stuff like ""YOU THERE! You violated the law! Return your goods or serve your sentence!""  But still, its amazing how much time they put in to the voice acting... and the Narrator... gosh, very good job... you mostly hear his voice, he is describing EVERYTHING you see, smell, feel, do. Its truly amazing.  Sometimes you hear the same voice actor from another person... but this is not a biggy. They did the same in Oblivion, but i dont mind, some people do but not me, a simple little thing.   Multiplayer / Co-op / D&D Mode Alright, lets make this one short, There  is the PvP in alpha/beta, quite fun, then you are able to play the WHOLE Story with 3 others... other player. It's super fun, but i recommend to play with someone you know or to scream at... if you play with randoms... they attack the guard... many... times... its a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sometimes people dont do that, but many do...  So now to the D&D section, Thats one of the best features the game can offer right next to the single-player. I recommend not to access the Game Master Mode, many spoilers there, enemy types, loot etc.  It's hard to describe, but all you need to know, its like a level editor, or like that one thing from Arma 3 Zeus mode. You can role Dice, you can possess NPC's you can do all kind of♥♥♥♥♥♥ But... you need to do all by your self. That means, no NPC's walking around, only you, moving people from A to b. Would be cool if they would add something like a Waypoint/patrol mode so people are walking around citys, taverns etc.   Battles, Fight's, What can you do SO, the main thing in divinity: Original Sin 2 is the battles, fights, etc.  I tried something harder then easy mode - died. You need some training in the beginning but you will find a way to deal with different enemy types and 'areas'.  By Area, i mean... You surrounding. There are some different types of 'things' laying around... Let's talk about the basic of the basic, Fire we all know it, we all hate it. You can ignite Oil with fire, you can throw oil at enemy's, you can burn an enemy and lead him in to a puddle of oil so they explode in a cool way. There are some other thinks like Water and wetness, combined with electricity... just try stuff... its super fun to combine these elements... you can also use magic to make it cursed ;)  My RatingAre there Physic's / Ragdoll in the game? - Yas How big is the map?                                   - Very big, much to explore How are the graphic's?                               - Very nice, smooth pleasent to watch people burn or acid away Fighting?                                                     - Very good, sometimes its too easy, sometimes its too hard, or just ged gud. Multiplayer?                                                - Everything works good, no disconnect stuff or lagging. Plenty of people are                                                                         playing this game Stuff to do?                                                 - Yas... A lot... you are not getting bored in this game... Replay potential?                                       - I think you could play this game like 30 times and you still wouldnt find everything in                                                this game, many secrets, many options, combine race/trait's and you will have a different out come Is it buy worthy? Yes! 100% but ONLY when you are a fan of TBG/MMO/RPG's video games. A few games as example:  XCOM: Enemy unknown Dragon Age The Witcher Mass EffectThere are just a hand full of good MMORPG's out there, and if you like turn based combat, then its the perfect game for you, you can waste so many hours in this game, finding the best way to solve problems without fighting. You coudl play this game for a long time just to find out what else is hidden in this game. Gather some friends, play D&D online master the dungeons together. When you search a game with 100% on Metacritics or 10/10 IGN- Would Burn again then... you found it. It cost a lot of money, but its worth it. I think this game was on Kickstarter once too, but just look at it... so much time and effort. If there is a game that's worth the money, it's this one."

I spent over 100 hours on the starting island of Fort Joy completely f*$#ing around and having a blast.  At one point, I collected/stole basically everything I could and just laughed or nodded in respect at the wordplay/detail in the descriptions of each item.

However, the battles are quite challenging, interesting and varied and there is a LOT of content to keep you entertained for dozens of hours. Companions are great and add some great depth into the game. I hope this is a standard kept on RPGs now and with a better writting we will see better and better games.

RainyDay,121,3,0,March 31,Recommended,129.6,"An absolutely incredible experience, without a doubt, one of the finest rpgs to date, it certainly is the best I’ve ever played.  I wouldn’t know where to begin, the world is as interesting and alive as the long and beautifully crafted story, which stays strong for almost all of its entire 130h runtime.  If you’re new to rpgs, you might be put off by the inherent amount of lore and world building exposition these kinds of games often exhibit, but I must say that the game does a remarkable job of giving you all the information you need without overwhelming you. The world building is constant and just detailed enough as to make you want to fill in the details yourself using your own imagination.  Having not played the original Divinity Original Sin, I did not once feel like I was missing some important piece of lore or that I had missed out on anything story-wise, which is something I truly appreciate from the developers.  The writing is witty, fresh and fully voice acted. Not one person, monster or animal goes without a voice. The voice acting is also excellent, a pleasant surprise seeing how much has been had to be dubbed.  Combat is a lot of fun, and it only gets better the more you level up and are able to experiment with new interesting skills and combos; the only thing I feel could have been done better is how the different skill trees are explained. As it stands, only a very basic description is given, when important information, like that hydro spells are in the most part curative or that pyro spells focus more on damage should be explained somewhere. This is not such a major issue due to the fact that players are given the opportunity to respec at any time once they reach a certain point in the story (fairly early) , but still, it does make investing into certain trees a bit dangerous and daunting as a new player.  Overall, the game has provided me with a beautiful experience and I’m left reminiscing about my adventures in Rivellon alongside my memorable companions, thinking about what I could have done differently.  If you have even a passing interest in rpgs, try it, you won’t regret a second of it."

I have never been interested in them, but with all the praise this game has been receiving, I figured I would buy it to try it out. I have been thoroughly impressed with the quality and quantity of the game thus far, especially for the cheaper price tag. The level of complexity with the combat system and crafting is unmatched, I feel like I discover new ways to play the game every few minutes. It can be a difficult game, though that makes it so satisfying when you win a battle. The game doesn't hold your hand, and my friend started out feeling overwhelmed by what we could or couldn't do. The tactical decision making sort of reminds me of Dragon Age: Origins, though more in-depth by far.   Performance is pretty good, there isn't SLI support, though you probably won't need it. The game dropped frames significantly once when surrounded by fire, smoke, gas, and electricity in a high foliage area.

For now it's possessed with some nasty bugs that affect your gaming experience, missing strings here and there and so on.  The game however is a must-play and I actually recommend everyone familiarize themselves with it."

I have never been interested in them, but with all the praise this game has been receiving, I figured I would buy it to try it out. I have been thoroughly impressed with the quality and quantity of the game thus far, especially for the cheaper price tag. The level of complexity with the combat system and crafting is unmatched, I feel like I discover new ways to play the game every few minutes. It can be a difficult game, though that makes it so satisfying when you win a battle. The game doesn't hold your hand, and my friend started out feeling overwhelmed by what we could or couldn't do. The tactical decision making sort of reminds me of Dragon Age: Origins, though more in-depth by far.   Performance is pretty good, there isn't SLI support, though you probably won't need it. The game dropped frames significantly once when surrounded by fire, smoke, gas, and electricity in a high foliage area.

Loden DarkStar,312,3,0,September 5,Recommended,119.3,"Divinity has always been a great fantasy IP from the first through the Dragon Knight saga and now in Original Sin.   I am not usually a big fan of turn based combat and that might give people cause to pause when considering this game, it did with me anyway .... dont let that stop you though.   This is a true role playing game something we see so very rarely these days, the turn based mechanic of the combat wont get in your way. In my experance any way the game's turn based mechancis wont adversly impact your enjoyment in any way, if anything you may find you like it if only in this specific case. As to the story, world and characters they are all master strokes through and through, the massive array of options and granular details to game give it huge replayability just in terms of the main campaign and the community have added a lot more via mods and scenarios. Put simply you will get your monies worth out of this game just from the stock content then on top of that you have a great community giving you even more via Workshop and Nexus.  Cons? Nothing really, while the game isn't perfect ... simply because nothing is ... there is nothing I would see changed about it that isn't a matter of personal taste and for thouse aspects of taste the community has that covered in mods e.g. difficulty rebalance, spell effects, rate of progression, etc."

calibrojosh10,393,4,0,January 27,Recommended,100.9,"What I liked:   Improves almost every aspect from the first game     The best combat system thus far     Voice acting (I didn’t play the updated original)     Story at some parts is amazing     Game designed with co-op and solo in a CRPG???!!?! What You Need to Know:   I played this game solo (#FOREVERALONE), even though having two copies from Kickstarting the game. I would love to play the game co-op to see the game how a great game is even better with a friend competing for how the game plays.      With that out of the way, I want to start with the story. It’s all over the place. I don’t remember the story from the first one and I’ll probably forget most of this game too. The first 2 acts which is about 60 hours of the game and feels at times lackluster in terms of the pacing, with only the ending of each act being amazing mostly in terms of what it makes you fight. The last 3 acts each get more focused on the main quest and side quests that branch from it. The huge time sink in the game is how many side quests you get or prevent from completing if you kill everyone.      The game does favor heavily playing the good side as after watching the ending you get 30 seconds if choosing anything other than the good option with no details on anything other than world is screwed. You choose to be good; you get over 10 minutes of details about every character you helped, companions, and the entire world in way more detail. I usually play the hero and help anyone I can and accidently picked the wrong option as it I thought it was the good choice. The whole tone at the end, is based on this final pick regardless of what you do in the rest of the game. So no matter how you play pick the good ending so you can hear your story.  The players you create can be just random dude that is standard with most RPG’s. I decided to play as the undead guy because I got the collector’s edition and he’s the statue you get, so why not. I’ve never played as an undead which heals from poison, hurt from normal healing, as well as agro npc if you get naked, lol. With these premade characters of 6, they allow you get a quest for yourself and for each companion you bring along. You can also play as undead of any race too. So you get options bro.      The combat improves from the first one with two armors that while up prevents the major status effects that previously was percentage and more chanced based. I like this move to prevent save scumming for effects. You have battles taking place in areas that have verticality that can extend or block skills as well as increase or decrease damage based on the height. You have everything from the first one that I love with over one hundred skills that each have a purpose since you have elements playing a role. You get curse and blessed variants on each element. What I’m trying to say is the combat is by far my favorite so far. I’m loving turned based combat more and more with each game I play.      The game scales loot you find in the world but not quests as they are static, this saddens completing quests that are levels below you as the reward sucks. The AI you fight feels at times cheating as they never attacked my undead character with poison ever and always knew what elements are my weakness and feel like they know everything regardless of level or enemy type. This does make the game more difficult but actually plays like a real person would. I never got the feeling of laughing once at a stupid enemy messing up and healing my dude. Also when my characters are charmed they always do the dumbest stuff and use all my potions and scrolls, this was actually funny to watch and always had more than they could use. I do know the AI being too smart can be modded to feel more artificial if you don’t like that feature.       My biggest gripe is the interface to shift items around characters and when crafting no search option. This is so freaking stupid, with efforts put into teleporting items to relevant characters when needed for actions to save tedious shifting items; they forgot that when you pick up everything, I have a lot of crap sort to which player to give to. This is tedious when doing by item. Let us set items to go to certain players that use those items like arrows, grenades, and armor. So much time is wasted sorting and finding out who needs what item. Also crafting when you have hundreds of materials is hard to find the one you need. Dear god this was annoying at times. Not enough to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, but enough to annoy me.      Crafting is no longer a skill to put points into; you learn recipes and anyone can craft them. This sounds nice but I never really crafted until the end to prepare for the last fight. So that feature felt lackluster compared to the first game.       Overall the game is another instant classic just like the original. You don’t have to play the first one to understand this one. The combat has so much depth in it and was the main draw for me and did not disappoint. The story overall only felt epic at ends of each act with some fun side quests, especially the animal ones. I love the pet pal talent. All the major side quests had satisfying endings and I can’t wait for a 3rd game. These devs have made me to understand why old school RPG’s are the best and can’t go back to shallow ones anymore. Thanks Larian Studios for showing me da wae of CRPG’s as I’m still new to the genre, as to why I don’t have much recommendations.    My Score: A+ Paid: $135 Completed in: 90 hours  Games similar I recommend:   Magicka  ( pure magic combat)     UnderRail ( has some flaws)    Pillars of Eternity 2  (Haven’t played either game yet. Looking forward to them) "

I must admit I was disapointed after few playing hours to realize RPG content isnt as deeply as classic aD&D games and Builder very different of what I hoped with a just succession of very small maps.   If you got in your group someone who speaks with animals, have good persuasion and wits scores, with only DamageDealers you're sure you'll miss nothing and progress easely : quests are interesting but dont need any analysis or long searchs, no mortal traps anywhere, no oneshots (maybe with Alice or missing in making Hannag one of your friends), no wipes (except being too optimistic with Adrahmalihk), quite nothing to detect, quite nothing to miss anywhere (Braccus legs ?) and finaly a hardest difficulty mode ""too soft"" for most of players.  So... how explain our actual 600hours on DOS2 HM with many différent groups and choices (magical, physical, distants, ranges, with  tank, with only DD, 2 lonewolves, wipe maps in genocides, or pacifist ""just alone"") ? For me the biggest quality of this game isnt RPG at all but by-turn-combat options and strategies, with many different builds choices and mix for each member. Every tactical/HM combat is a +/- complex arena where you must analyze options and ways to success. Concerning GameMastering Leaks are finaly forces : this part of game must be seen as a way to play exactly the way you RPG-play around a table, and not to create a big scripted world like with Aurora (NeverwinterNights).   Except minor changes in menus, dialogs, a global easier game (...), a new strange corpses ragdoll animation and a bigger game folder, sorry to see DefinityEdition bringing nothing more. But DOS2 is one of the most dynamic and interesting games I played with friends for many years."

Domush,119,4,0,"June 2, 2017",Recommended,116.1,"Easily one of the best RPG's I've ever played, and it's still in Alpha. Superb!  My only gripe (and it's a HUGE gripe!) is the uber-confusing dialog.   It's all written in the third person, so you can't tell if the dialog means 'you' (as in your character who is speaking/acting/thinking) or 'you' (as in the character they are speaking to).   WTF? It's ROLE PLAYING! Make the dialog 1st person!  Example dialog:  (and yes, every selection is enclosed in asterisks for no reason.. no dialog quotes anywhere in the game)  1: *you ask what do you have to do* - Am I asking what I have to do? What the other person has to do?  2: *you demand to let your sword go* - Let my sword go? Let your sword go?  3: *you look puzzled* - Am I looking puzzled as an action? I am saying they look puzzled?   4: *you wonder why the dialog is all in 3rd person, since you can barely tell what's a thought or action or what's actually said out loud (and to whom)*   5: *you facepalm at the ridiculousness of it all; you don't know who 'you' is referring to*  Other than that, it's a wonderful game. Of course, the dialog is 1/3 of the entire game, so that's a MAJOR issue.  Also, the dialog was written by a non-native english speaker. It's obvious, and slightly irritating since, beyond the above issue, there are some dialog options which make no sense whatsoever, yet can mean the difference between your character living and dying in the game.  Example: NARRATOR: *you see a runed vase with an inscription warning you to not pull the lever unless you have fund scrolls to tell* (and yes, all descriptions come in the form of dialog with a pretend person named ""NARRATOR"", instead of just describing the scene in a normal way. Very hokey, and a constant immersion killer.)  1: *you pull the lever, confident you are ready* 2: *you break the vase* 3: *you open the vase and absorb the entity inside*  Wait.. What?! WTF does ""have fund scrolls to tell"" mean? Which optin shold I be choosing? How do I back out? PS: You can't back out of dialog, so you MUST make a choice. Your guess is as good as mine what the non-english part is supposed to mean, but the rest of the game is decided in that moment and there are no take-backs.  So, yeah, awesome, awesome game, with the most ridiculous dialog/narration I've ever seen."

calibrojosh10,393,4,0,January 27,Recommended,100.9,"What I liked:   Improves almost every aspect from the first game     The best combat system thus far     Voice acting (I didn’t play the updated original)     Story at some parts is amazing     Game designed with co-op and solo in a CRPG???!!?! What You Need to Know:   I played this game solo (#FOREVERALONE), even though having two copies from Kickstarting the game. I would love to play the game co-op to see the game how a great game is even better with a friend competing for how the game plays.      With that out of the way, I want to start with the story. It’s all over the place. I don’t remember the story from the first one and I’ll probably forget most of this game too. The first 2 acts which is about 60 hours of the game and feels at times lackluster in terms of the pacing, with only the ending of each act being amazing mostly in terms of what it makes you fight. The last 3 acts each get more focused on the main quest and side quests that branch from it. The huge time sink in the game is how many side quests you get or prevent from completing if you kill everyone.      The game does favor heavily playing the good side as after watching the ending you get 30 seconds if choosing anything other than the good option with no details on anything other than world is screwed. You choose to be good; you get over 10 minutes of details about every character you helped, companions, and the entire world in way more detail. I usually play the hero and help anyone I can and accidently picked the wrong option as it I thought it was the good choice. The whole tone at the end, is based on this final pick regardless of what you do in the rest of the game. So no matter how you play pick the good ending so you can hear your story.  The players you create can be just random dude that is standard with most RPG’s. I decided to play as the undead guy because I got the collector’s edition and he’s the statue you get, so why not. I’ve never played as an undead which heals from poison, hurt from normal healing, as well as agro npc if you get naked, lol. With these premade characters of 6, they allow you get a quest for yourself and for each companion you bring along. You can also play as undead of any race too. So you get options bro.      The combat improves from the first one with two armors that while up prevents the major status effects that previously was percentage and more chanced based. I like this move to prevent save scumming for effects. You have battles taking place in areas that have verticality that can extend or block skills as well as increase or decrease damage based on the height. You have everything from the first one that I love with over one hundred skills that each have a purpose since you have elements playing a role. You get curse and blessed variants on each element. What I’m trying to say is the combat is by far my favorite so far. I’m loving turned based combat more and more with each game I play.      The game scales loot you find in the world but not quests as they are static, this saddens completing quests that are levels below you as the reward sucks. The AI you fight feels at times cheating as they never attacked my undead character with poison ever and always knew what elements are my weakness and feel like they know everything regardless of level or enemy type. This does make the game more difficult but actually plays like a real person would. I never got the feeling of laughing once at a stupid enemy messing up and healing my dude. Also when my characters are charmed they always do the dumbest stuff and use all my potions and scrolls, this was actually funny to watch and always had more than they could use. I do know the AI being too smart can be modded to feel more artificial if you don’t like that feature.       My biggest gripe is the interface to shift items around characters and when crafting no search option. This is so freaking stupid, with efforts put into teleporting items to relevant characters when needed for actions to save tedious shifting items; they forgot that when you pick up everything, I have a lot of crap sort to which player to give to. This is tedious when doing by item. Let us set items to go to certain players that use those items like arrows, grenades, and armor. So much time is wasted sorting and finding out who needs what item. Also crafting when you have hundreds of materials is hard to find the one you need. Dear god this was annoying at times. Not enough to♥♥♥♥♥♥me off, but enough to annoy me.      Crafting is no longer a skill to put points into; you learn recipes and anyone can craft them. This sounds nice but I never really crafted until the end to prepare for the last fight. So that feature felt lackluster compared to the first game.       Overall the game is another instant classic just like the original. You don’t have to play the first one to understand this one. The combat has so much depth in it and was the main draw for me and did not disappoint. The story overall only felt epic at ends of each act with some fun side quests, especially the animal ones. I love the pet pal talent. All the major side quests had satisfying endings and I can’t wait for a 3rd game. These devs have made me to understand why old school RPG’s are the best and can’t go back to shallow ones anymore. Thanks Larian Studios for showing me da wae of CRPG’s as I’m still new to the genre, as to why I don’t have much recommendations.    My Score: A+ Paid: $135 Completed in: 90 hours  Games similar I recommend:   Magicka  ( pure magic combat)     UnderRail ( has some flaws)    Pillars of Eternity 2  (Haven’t played either game yet. Looking forward to them) "

Arumin,260,4,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,54.9,"If you like PC-style top-down RPG's, you have to get this game. It's really quite that simple.  People here have already given descriptions left and right in their reviews, I've very little to add to that. Sufficed to say that where Larian's Original Sin (1) was already a very good game, but had minor nuisances here and there, this one, at fricking Early Access Alpha, already felt, looked, and played like a true AAA title. Everything that was in Original Sin has been improved many fold, all the flaws and nuisances fixed, all the good things perfected, and so, so much more added on top. So much so, that I'd have to write a novel to cover it all.  The age of RPG's - in my opinion - has been in decline for a good 10 years with previous big players like BioWare and Bethesda being stuck, even backtracking in their production of quality games. CD Projekt Red managed to start a new evolution of AAA RPG titles with its brilliant Witcher 3, but has so far seen no even remotely serious competition. Now, having played Original Sin 2, it's blatantly obvious that barring some extremely unlikely U-turns in the full release, Larian Studios will be cementing its position as the latest Gold producer with Midas' touch.  The overwhelmingly positive reviews in Steam and everywhere else are not a coincidence, as it's easy to see that this game will be a BIG deal. It's quite simply that insanely good."

So many different interactions with various elements. New spells, magic schools, and more. If you like cRPGS, or the last game  and don't wanna wait, then I'd buy this game for sure.

I saw the game grow from within the kickstartes, I saw Swens comments on the changes, it all looked and felt so good. For backers they had some polls on what we wanted them to focus on. And, by Jove, did they pull our requests off. This game is awesome, storywise, gameplaywise, sound&musicwise,... (image a ton of more wises ;-) )If you are into RPG's, play this game! Take your time to explore it all, take your time for several replays of the game because the world is so open yo have so many opportunities you do not get all quests, storylines, characterdevelopments in one playthrough! Invest in this game and let the times pass, it will be next year before you know it. Before I forget it, this game can even be played in co-op (up to 4 players), what else do you need (maybe some beer, chips and a girlfriend, but that's not important now) For d&d fans they even implemented a game master mode (with one d&d campaign already worked out for your party!) to make sure you will never ever have to play the same story.

For 33 USD (For the deluxe edition), this game offers a lot more than most AAA titles in the past months, or even years. This review is here to hopefully show you how much you NEED this game. (Note: Not all the games content is able to fit into one review, so I will try to keep this as short as possible.)                                                     DIVINITY: ORIGINAL SIN 2 Review (Spoilers Ahead)   Story:  I have played a few modern  RPGs in my life. Mass Effect, Dragon Age, SWOTR, Skyrim, Fallout, Phantasy Star, Final Fantasy, but none of them really hold a candle to how much content and diversity this game contains. The story itself is continued after the events of Original Sin, but taake place hundreds of years after, meaning that there is no need to play the original to know what happens here. You play as a Sourcerer, a being able to tap into the misterious Source to use powers that are deemed too dangerous for the public.   I won't go too in detail on that, but from there, your journey begins. When I say ""your"" I don't really mean JUST your character that you made for the game, but YOU as well. This game makes YOU an integral part of the story, not just your character. You can traverse the world and do whatever you want.   The best part of the story is that it is non-linear. Hell, the entire game isn't linear, but I'll get to that. Any and EVERY choice that you make has an impact on, not just the story itself, but the lives of everybody around you, and it shows. The story can be played hundreds of times and still feel fresh. Different ""tags"" that you get/use (talked about in character customization) allow you to interact with people differently. What race you choose also makes a huge impact on how characters interact with you.   In this game, there are 6 different ""origin characters"" that allow you to experience their story through their point of view. I haven't done this myself (having only 38 hours into the game at the time of this review) but it is interesting to see the world through their eyes. If you don't want to, you can always use your own character and recruit them as ""allies.""  Note that in this game, your companions stories play out alongside yours. Choices will have to be made. Thats all I'm saying about that.  This game also allows for friends to enter your game alongside you. Many different things can happen, and you may end up fighting each other if you decide against it.   Quests can be found anywhere, especially NPC's. Depending on your choices however, they may be harsher to you, or maybe even not give you the quest in the first place.    Character Customizations:  This is arguably the least amazing thing in the game, which is saying something because it is still better than most other RPG creation systems. You can customize anything from a persons style, to their tags (which are sort of like occupations, which affect the story and dialogue.) It is here that you can also choose what class you are going to be. I won't go into too much detail, but know that choosing a class doesn't mean that you stay that class forever. You can spec your character into whatever class you want. One should note however that your beginning weapon is determined by your class.  You can also choose your atributes and skills in this section. Note that these affect your beginning character, and possibly your end game character if you stay on the road that you started.    Combat:  The flexibility of the story applies to combat as well. There are dmany different skills that you can choose from, which can be learned using books. Note that it is impossible to learn a skill if you don't have the right stats for it. There are many different ways a battle can go.. especially since the AI is good on higher difficulties.   There are different elements that can be used to your advantage. These elements give different debuffs to your oponents, but not all of them are effective as there are resistances. With the introduction of Divinity Original Sin 2 comes armor. These values are found on top of the health bar, and they serve the purpose of negating any and all debuffs, so you need to take care of that first.   In this game, you might notice some elements on the ground. If you happen to hit it either with a skill or basic attack, it turns into something different. For example, if an enemy is standing on a pudddle, you can use an electricity skill to stun them and cause them to lose a turn. Or, if they are standing on oil, using fire would cause an explosion, dealing damage as well as DOT. The possibilities are endless.   The only limit to combat is how many action points you have. This can be increased with the use of armor and skills, but I won't get too into that.    Music/Voice Acting:  For a game that almost didn't have voice acting, it is done pretty damn well. Every character is fully voiced. With a certain perk that even allows you to talk to and get quests from animals. Its 100% amazing. Over 1,000,000 lines of dialogue was recorded for this game, and each one really pushes the game along  The music is superb. Both thematic and atmospheric, it really helps immerse you in the world of Divinity. You can even choose which of 4 instruments will be playing during the game. It is amazing.   Mods and Downloads:  Aside from all of this content, Larian has decided that this game needed mods. They also allowed players to make their own stories using the ingame assets, which, for a 33 dollar game is astounding. While I would say that mods and downloads aren't NEEDED for the game to be amazing, it really adds to the replayability of the game as a whole. Note that using mods will disable achievements for the game, so you achievement hunters out there will need to play without them.   Multiplayer:  Sometimes, it gets a little lonely, so playing with friends is an option, and in my opinion, a MUST TRY. You can play with up to 4 players online, and 2 on split screen (YES THERE IS SPLITSCREEN.) They can help you do many things... of which I shouldn't spoil. You can even sabotage them when fighting, and you can even initiate PVP with them.   Speaking of PVP, there is a designated area for such, where you team up with others in order for you to kill your oponents. I haven't played the game mode myself, but it does look fun.    Closing Thoughts:  BUY THIS ALREADY. "

Mr Mojorisin,117,4,0,"December 21, 2016",Recommended,192.1,"The game is pretty great so far - highly recommended. I just finished the first Original Sin and the second seems to only improve upon all aspects (minus some of the character personality trait stuff that I hope theyt bring back). Visuals are much more appealing - I feel much more drawn in to each area I explore and combat retains the strategic elements that made the first so enjoyable (ie spending an hour to line up my ability because I saw it flash red for a second and im not spending another AP to step forward, damnit). I can't remember if there is a difficulty setting but whatever I had it on before a recent update invalidated all my save files was pretty challenging (frequent and large updates make it kinda pointless to sink too many hours into the game at this point, even though they give you the old builds so you can still play old saves). I really can't wait for this to be completed. I just hope they bring back all the excellent voice work for the second. There was so much great dialogue in the first - every animal voiced, every person had something to say and it never felt annoying. The dialogue style is set up differently from the first (characters talk to you as a player rather than to the source hunter) which may mean that voice acting isnt coming for your characters...? I'll update my review though if I find out!"

baardvaark,60,4,0,"April 10, 2017",Recommended,205.9,"No need to repeat what everyone else has said, except to say that the modding scene should be much more improved and supported than the first game. I wouldn't expect skyrim level modding, but there's a ton of potential for gameplay overhauls and new content, never mind a possibly revolutionary game master mode, if that sort of thing compells you to buy a game. Many of the criticisms regarding balance and difficulty could be solved by modders in the first couple months. Heck, many aspects of the game are already moddable, though obviously it'd be a bit silly to mod an alpha.  Barring a large drop in quality in the later acts (extremely unlikely), this will probably be an instant classic with amazing RPG gameplay that far surpasses its predecessor in narrative quality.  I will say Larian could be a bit more generous with more skills for us to play with in the alpha, but let me tell you, from what I've seen, there are going to be a LOT more cool skills in the final release. ;) "

Not to mention the mods (with a provided mod tool to make your own). People can make and upload there own campaign providing endless game content. More then this there is a dungeons master mode that is really solid and allows the DM to make modifications on the fly. Add in controller solid controller support as well as split screen Co-op (up to 2 people for one PC) and 4 player online Co-op AND competitive questing (yes there are multiple, conflicting paths to take in completeing a quest and two or more players can take directly opposing routes in those quests therefore competeing against each other) I do not see how you can not at least respect this game and its developers.

I must admit I was disapointed after few playing hours to realize RPG content isnt as deeply as classic aD&D games and Builder very different of what I hoped with a just succession of very small maps.   If you got in your group someone who speaks with animals, have good persuasion and wits scores, with only DamageDealers you're sure you'll miss nothing and progress easely : quests are interesting but dont need any analysis or long searchs, no mortal traps anywhere, no oneshots (maybe with Alice or missing in making Hannag one of your friends), no wipes (except being too optimistic with Adrahmalihk), quite nothing to detect, quite nothing to miss anywhere (Braccus legs ?) and finaly a hardest difficulty mode ""too soft"" for most of players.  So... how explain our actual 600hours on DOS2 HM with many différent groups and choices (magical, physical, distants, ranges, with  tank, with only DD, 2 lonewolves, wipe maps in genocides, or pacifist ""just alone"") ? For me the biggest quality of this game isnt RPG at all but by-turn-combat options and strategies, with many different builds choices and mix for each member. Every tactical/HM combat is a +/- complex arena where you must analyze options and ways to success. Concerning GameMastering Leaks are finaly forces : this part of game must be seen as a way to play exactly the way you RPG-play around a table, and not to create a big scripted world like with Aurora (NeverwinterNights).   Except minor changes in menus, dialogs, a global easier game (...), a new strange corpses ragdoll animation and a bigger game folder, sorry to see DefinityEdition bringing nothing more. But DOS2 is one of the most dynamic and interesting games I played with friends for many years."

(Meaning I play a game get bored 10 minutes later and full neglect the game for others.)  Well, I'm literally neglecting all of my other games for this. This game is amazing. Hands down one of the best RPG's since Hello Kitty: Island Adventurer.  For the price it seriously doesn't get any better than this.  I sat on it for awhile thinking about if I should get it.  Now, I regret not getting sooner than what I did. So if you're sitting there looking at this, looking at reviews, trying to figure out if you want this.

milkandwine,107,4,0,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,149.0,"a truly wonderful game. most bugs have been fixed now. expect a somewhat nonlinear quest system though, the game does not just point you to a point and say: ""fetch!"". this makes the story more of your own making. personally, i checked a bunch of tips online, i imagine playing without any guides can bring you some unexpected quest failures. combat is very hard, tougher than d:os I. unless you plan every ability and position your team optimally, you ll die easily on harder modes"
SOPMOD Musket,463,4,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,195.5,"Pretty good so far.  Its only in early access but I am impressed from what I see so far.  The combat seems more enjoyable, especially if you make a super tank class.  In DOS1 being a straight tank would require you to use your whole first turn just to walk over to the enemy since you were so weighed down with armor.  With there being fewer action points, it almost seems like you can do more.  Some things in game are still locked off, like the ability to change starting skills, but its still fun.    If you are unsure whether to get this game or not, since you have not played the first game, BUY THE FIRST GAME and try that out since it is only $20 now.  If you dont enjoy how that games mechanics are, you probablt will not enjoy this one."

It doesn't hold your hand and gives you a lot of freedom in how to approach situations.

The Big Alex,104,2,0,January 22,Recommended,59.4,"Finally we, the human race have been blessed with Larian Studios. Those guys really understand what makes a RPG game good and the Turn-Based twang just fits the game perfectly. The game looks very good and has a good artistic vision that takes a lot from the classic such as Baldurs Gate or Dungeon Siege but elevates it to this heavenly tier.  Customization is top notch, it feels like you can make your character from scratch however you want - Larian Studios understand that giving the power to the player and making him play like he wants is a good choice unlike trash devs like Ubisoft or EA.   Story might be the only weak spot of the game. While very rich it feels like we, a player, are jump cutting through scene to scene to scene without proper introduction which may feel kinda underwhelming. Also not fully knowing the villain of the game doesn't play to it's strength - because main villain isn't as mysterious as one might want.  Combat is good but not amazing. Definitely an improvement from previous installment but not perfect. Combat seems to be very hard at the beggining of the game but as you start getting more abilities, synergies and items it becomes easy even on hardest difficulties.   Despite that this game really shows that slower RPGs can be successful if there isn't a retard in front of the wheel and Larian executes this with sugeon precision. 7-8/10"
¿,315,2,0,May 4,Recommended,150.3,"It is pretty uncommon that I write reviews, and I will preface that when I played this game it was much much closer to its release date.   This game is utterly amazing, that is not to say there are negatives (I will have a bullet point pros con list at the bottom of this review), but it did not take long for me to think of this game as one of my favorite RPG games ever made. I think of this game as a modern day baulders gate. It has great story, its sound tracks are amazing, combat is diverse and enjoyable. Multiplayer was done Superbly.  Now if you are thinking about getting this game, a here are a few things you should know before purchase. Combat is turnbased, if you do not like turnbased games you may not like this games (especially because it is not a cheap game). DO NOT play honor mode if you have yet to beat the game yet (its a mode that if your party all dies your ONLY save gets deleted, and the fights are at the hardest difficulty level), the triggers for this are NOT common, however there are traps that will instantly kill folk around them, Which I walked into all of them. Restarting your entire game because of a trap like that will drive you insane.    Agian I played back closer to release but, when I played there were a fair amount of bugs in the game. This game easily makes up for it, but the bugs do exsist. At certian points in the game you may be unsure what quest you should do next. (Now if you are playing normal mode this may not affect you like it did me, because I was playing a harder difficulty setting, and I needed ot make sure I was not fighting things higher level than my self) Because if you plan to follow the monster levels and have them be equal to yours, it requires you to jump around the map alot finding out what quest areas are your level (unless of course you look up a guide, i would advise agianst that).  The 2nd act? (third map its a island), I was not too fond of this area, and I think it will most likely be most peoples least favorite spot, there are some dry moments, just take it slow and get through it this game has some really cool suprises for you.  Also dont take lone wolf as a perk unless you want to ruin the game, its the closest thing to a cheat code in that game I know of, you can pretty much breeze through the game on hardest difficulty if you use it.   TLDR: Pros Cons List.  Pros -Great Story -Great Music -Well Balanced Combat / Enjoyable Combat -Cool Cast of characters -Good leveling system -Good multiplayer Setup -Waypoint system making map travel easier  Cons -Quest order can be confusing at times -Island map is a little dry at times  if you saw a video of this game, and liked the top down aesthetic, and understand this is a RPG, I would 10/10 rate this game for you, you should buy and play it you wont regret it."

TeslaFox,337,2,0,July 1,Recommended,488.0,"Divinity is easily one of the greatest RPG's to come out in the last few years. Classic atmosphere with engaging battles and rich quests. The story is really great and even the smallest side quests are fun and interesting. With challanging battles and great emphasis on tactics, this game became so addictive for me that after finishing this game it's really hard to find something that will compare to it. Not to mention Larian were great with everything bug related, I bought the game once it released and every bug I encountered was quickly solved once I contacted them.  10/10 - worth your money, your time, your life.

JimmyWolf,731,2,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,95.8,"I'm 20 hours in, playing with the same friend I played all the way through Divinity: Original Sin with.  We love that we're back in this world. It's beautiful, exceptionally well crafted and an exciting experience.  Combat is even more expansive than before, mixing the ideas that were so successful in the first game (use of elemental surfaces and spells) with new ideas such as the addition of an armour system for both magic and physical damage. This is something of a double edged sword though, on the one hand the armour system makes combat a really interesting dynamic of carefully choosing opponents based on whether their magic or physical armour is higher, what resistances they have and so on, but outside of the combat, the armour system makes traps completely devoid of threat as their effects will not breach your naturally regenerating armour. Whereas in the first game suddenly being hit by a fire trap would send on a quick jump to your hotbar to prepare a Rain spell or healing, now you just walk on without an issue.  We've deliberately avoided choosing the characters with origin stories as we're looking to focus on the main story and avoid the party dynamics that the game has. These characters can leave if they dislike the choices you make, which I fully support as a choice by Larian, but it's something to bear in mind when building your party at the start.   One thing that definitely amazes me is the full voice-acting. Thats a huge amount of work, especially as the Narrator is fully voiced as well. Well done to Larian, that must have taken an enormous amount of work, but it really adds to the world and to the immersion.  The only thing we miss is the music from the first game. Larian cannot be blamed for this, as the composer for the first game passed away but his music was exceptional and an extremely high bar to match. The music this time round feels too quiet pretty much all the time even at full volume and if we find a mod that adds the music from the first game we'll be grabbing that as soon as possible.  So far, 9/10, the only issues being the music and gameplay niggles that sometimes break an otherwise amazingly immersive experience"

Alariq,278,2,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,65.9,"Yes, I would reccomend this game. Is it the best thing since the invention of pizza since people are claiming? Not really.  The Good:  - Very Pretty Graphics / Reasonably optimized - Great Customization - Fully voiced, great overall quality of acting - Good world building and lore, main story can be a bit convoluted at times. - Reasonably Balanced  The Bad:  - I'm not very fond of a couple of combat systems. I think they have overdone the surface system. Every combat , even the tiniest ones end up a swirling chaos of destruction everywhere with burning/poison/shock/blood what have you everywhere. - Mobs instantly spawn on conveniently placed vantage points to harass you all the time. It's less about organic fights and more like forcing you to reload because you were exploring and not ready for a fight to spawn from thin air. This kinda creates the feeliing that the game is bending the rules against you, cheapening the experience overall. - Mediocre tutorial overall. Fails to tell you some key details like Lizards don't need shovels and skeletons don't need lockpicks. - Some bugs, like only half you party entering combat while the other half watches. You have to manually move your characters into combat, even though they are right there in the first place.  All in all, if you're a fan of CRPGs you'll likely enjoy this as I have. but, if you're new to the genre, there are more friendly places to start."

Blood-Lord,119,2,0,"September 23, 2016",Recommended,170.0,"I don't normally prepurchase video games. However, for Larian Studios which created a fantastic game in Divinity: Original Sin I will gladly support this game as well.  Rock, Paper, Scissors: The game play seems close to the original, with minor tweaks and additional combat strategies to worry about. The one thing I've noticed that was missing is where is the rock, papers, and scissors argument from the first game? I loved disagreeing with my friends and having to do this mini game.  From what I can tell the game play feels smoother, looks crisper and the amount of details that they've added to the game. I feel like what ever I do might have repercussions through out the game. Also, they seemed to have created multiple ways of completeing quests, or taking different routes to do the same job.   Source:  I understand that source spending spells are much more powerful than non-source spending spells. However, I believe after even 1 play through gathering source will become tedious and cumbersome. There needs to be a better way to gather this resource than swapping a wand/item with vamperism among the players.  Source solution?: I would like to note that doing this to the dead bodies is very enjoyable. It makes the game that much more immerism. Not sure how to improve upon this to make it more efficent? Maybe devour all sourcible dead bodies around you with one spell cast? However, only the number of source points that you're missing. This will keep the immerism of the spell, yet make gathering this material that much faster.   Source Soul Jars: Side note on the source resource. If you're able to suck source from the undead with an item. Whats the significance of stealing the souls from those stuck in a jar? Aren't these source captures suppose to be more potent or have more of a permanent touch to the character? From absorbing these souls you're loosing out on experience and possibly dialog with characters in this world.  These should be rare and have an additional progress to the characters in their own way. Maybe such as leadership adds bounses to the character. Doing this will add minior bounces to the character who devoured the soul. Bracchus Rex was doing things similar to this and became extremely powerful. Why can't we?  Also, doing this should reduce your attitude towards people to balance this out. #DarksideFTW :D  Act 1 Final Battle: Most encounters in the first act I had no problem. I understand that this game takes tactical placement, and combat very serious. Which is why I love games like this. Admittedly I am no fool when it comes to games like this. However, I would like to address the final battle of act 1. I believe this battle to not be challenging... Just way over powered to the players level and gear.   My friend and I were level 8 with all the quests, and gear that we could get from this island. However, when we got to this it was like hitting a giant wall. Took us around 2-3 hours to complete this battle with numerious amounts of tactics. Finally, I gathered the idea of getting all the explosive oil/ooze barrels on the island that remained and blow Alex and the worm to hell.  Here is a screenshot of what we did to kill the bastard.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769604881   Bug Dwarf Height: While going to Bracchus Rex's castle theres a part where you need to touch a gargoyle head to go through a portal. While doing this our dwarf in the party wasn't able to reach this gargoyle. Heres a screen shot of that below  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769608678   Arena Dead but Still Kicking Bug: After doing the arena and loosing to my friend. I was killed, but immediately revived going back to the arena master. My walking animation looked like I was dead, but still moving. Heres a screen shots of that below.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769176176 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769176554   Overall, if you enjoy turn based, rpg, in depth tactical combat with a very in depth storyline and involvement. This is the game for you!  P.S: This review is bound to change if I think of anything else to add."

tigran_petrosjan,42,2,0,"August 26, 2017",Recommended,875.2,"This game has the potential to become a masterpiece. It has all the strenghts of the first game`s Enhanced Edition, offers turn-based combat and plenty elemental interactions (make it rain, aoe stun through blitz bolt - create a fire surface, throw poison onto it for a huge explosion etc.). You can play with up to four party members and can either create your own character or take one of the four (after full release six) pre-made characters. While the first game lacked in the story, this 2nd part is much better in this regard. It has a much darker tone and so far the story delivers fully. It is grim, entertaining and really complex. Also the possibility of party dialogue and getting different results when talking with different party members to certain NPCs enlagerns its richness in this regard. But the strogest point of Divinity Origial Sin has always been its combat system. And the second part adds more features to that and makes everything even better. You now have aroumr fore physical and magic damage, which you have to break first in order to inflict status elements like stunned or burning or knocked down. Also there is a height system now, that your ranged characters can use for greater range and more damage.  And last but not least the game has after the full release on the 14th of September a Game Master Mode. There you can basically develop and play your own adventures with the Divinity engine and UI. With this you can create your own D&D - campaign and play it with your friends.  Another small feature is the Arena Mode, where you can explore the combat system with pre-defined characters on several maps. All this features offer easy access to multiplayer, I have atm ver 250 hours into this already great game and multiplayer worked fine every time. I regard Divinity Original Sin 2 in the highest order. This game was highly enjoyable already in its year in Early Access although it missed some of its features. Full release is now only two weeks away and if you like calssic RPGs which give you a challenging gameplay, try this game out. If you are into turn - based combat and tactical RPGs, you will find a great time here.  Gameplay 10/10 UI 9/10 Sound 9/10 Graphics 10/10 Story 9/10"

Dan,109,2,0,January 6,Recommended,247.8,"This is my first review, so I'm going to give it the ol college try.  Pro: Interesting characters. Decisions matter. You dont need to have played D:OS1 to enjoy this game. Players of D:OS1 will have some easter eggs. Lighthearted and dark at the same time.  Voiced narrator and characters (every RPG needs one, once you go voiced you cant go back to reading blocks of texts)  Con: Some bugs and performance issues. some sadness at the end (the kind that you get after finishing a really good book with no immediate sequels)  This is one of those games that by the time the credits roll, you want to give the devs a standing ovation.  P.S: if you want front row seats to the main story use Fane as your main character.  If you want an amazing/rich and personal story, pick Lohse. If you want a revenge/redemption tale, pick Ifan/Sebille/Beast If you want to experience a disgraced noble's rise to power pick The red prince.   "

The voice acting is some of the best done and the conversation options are unique with each person or thing you come to meet. Combat is fluid and fun with reactive environments and many skills and character builds to choose from.

I looked in a mirror and saw that I'd aged 60 years, my jowls sagged, leathery eyelids hung heavy over my now grey faded eyes. I looked outside and saw the changed world. The people wore such strange clothing, some wore suits of purple fur with their faces painted into crude animal caricatures, other people wore shoes on their hands and gloves on their feet, but nothing else. The world had changed so much, how long had I been playing Divinity? A single tear rolled down my cheek as flying automobiles whiz by my window.

Every aspect is of such high quality: the dialogue, the voice acting, the music, the excellent UI, the art style, the graphics, the amazing combat mechanics, the sense of exploration and adventure, the level design, the encounter design, the pacing... it's all super well done, way above what you normally get in an rpg.   There's such a large amount of things to find, places to explore, animals to talk to (If you have the required talent) and let’s not forget, towns filled with victims to pickpocket!   There are so many different classes you can have and you're not limited in any way, you could be a rogue necromancer or a tank archer if you wanted.   I'm 60+ hours in and it has not gotten tedious or started to feel formulaic or repetitive, which is something that I've never seen happen in a long single player game either.  The side stories, environments and things you do are varied enough to feel fresh after 60+ hours, the sense of exploration and adventure never goes away.   Every time you level up or progress further in the story you are rewarded with new spells and abilities that keep expanding on the combat and allowing you to experiment and try new builds and tactics, which keeps you from falling into familiar combat patterns/habits and keeps you entertained.   Watch on youtube some gameplay, buy the game. This is one game you won’t regret buying.  "
Dr. Nitrógeno,162,2,0,April 15,Recommended,71.3,"Very good game. I played the first one with my girlfriend and the co-op experience of two Lone Wolves was amazing, the second part is the same but with more content, nothing more.  Pros:  - Split Screen for PC - Very good Graphics - Unique storytelling and situations. - Best combat in a RPG so far (Sorry for the RTWP lovers) - Pet Pal Talent - Wells - Very good customization of characters, the magic mirror is amazing. - Very well optimized, the game runs smooth with a GTX770 in ultra, only few freezes in split screen.  Cons:   - ORIGINS, I don't like premade characters, if you choose lone wolf you skip a very big part of the game. - No Linux support. Seriously Larian? I needed to make a partition only to play the game. - Poor localization. I'm a native spanish speaker (I'm from Spain), for me english is not an issue but it is for my girlfriend...  Anyways, the game is one of the best RPG ever made, for me it's better than BG2 and Vampire: TMB.

(the fire does nothing to the guards and townsfolk not in combat yet hugging)  So there is that. Still a good game.  This is quickly turning into a feces title.  In sneak as a barrel tucked in a corner behind a tent BUT the guard detect vision goes through that type of object.   So much saving and loading because of lack of polish.  For instance just now; a fading mine that cloaks when your near.  -I saw it and manuver my man to a point where straight line in a safe corridor was the direct path. -I click the destination and my digidal dynamo heads off straight as an arrow like planned, only to vear 45* left straight into the mine blowing it and dodging a terrifying patch of THIN AIR!  Oh gawd so scary."

This game is packed full of content, deep combat, infinite replayablility, and good old tender loving care by a studio that clearly cares about their game just as much as we, the players, do.

They are continuing to update the game even now after full release to patch out some of the missed bugs which is reassuring.  Unlimited replayability, I've restarted at least 10-15 times now without finishing the game just because I figure something out, or I want to try something else.  Not because what I'm doing is getting stale, but rather that I'm just so curious about different outcomes that I'm compelled to go look at the alternative.   The multiplayer hop in/hop out style is super easy to learn, and I've already started working with the game master mode.  As a DnD GM, I can see the potential of divinity's game master mode, but I can tell it will take some learning and getting use to.  However I dont feel overwhelmed by any of the tutorials they have online, or any of the software.  Thanks for the awesome game."

Maejohl,168,2,0,"October 19, 2017",Recommended,65.0,"Great game, especially good in co-op mode."
Marirow,457,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,44.6," I'd recommend this game if you're a fan of tactical games like XCOM or Fire Emblem, or if you like story-heavy games.  The combat is the strongest part of the game, but it's also the hardest to get into; I had to restart the game multiple times to get the right party structure to tackle the game's challenges.  Adaptability and crowd control are key in this combat system. If you don't have the right party makeup, skills, and items, then it's going to feel like the game is cheating you. Enemies will constantly be inflicting status conditions (usually turn-skipping ones) if your armor isn't up to snuff. A lack of skills means that enemies will be able to out-maneuver and out-damage you. And, of course, having a party of all mages isn't a good idea when archers can just sit and take potshots at you three times a turn. If you're not sure what you're doing, there's no shame in playing on the lower difficulty setting. Trust me.  The other two major selling points of this game are the story and the exploration, both of which are a bit weaker in terms of originality but are just as great as the combat system. The dialogue is your standard Neverwinter Nights affair, made a bit spicier by the Tags system. Simply put, each character has Tags (related to aspects of their personality, history, or appearance) that give unique dialogue options. You can even acquire new tags as you play, making the system versatile as well. The dialogue itself is well-written and hilarious at times, giving the game a comedic twist and elevating it from a drab, boring fantasy adventure. I won't spoil the story, but I'll say that after 30 hours I've only brushed up against what the story has to offer. The thousands upon thousands of dialogue trees are backed up by some impressive voice acting, which makes reading through the game's story (which might as well be novel length, if not longer) actually fun and engaging instead of a slog.  The exploration, then. This is probably the weakest part of the game-- not  bad,  just  weaker.  The world is enormous and full of sidequests, characters, and miniature adventures to go on, which really scratched my explorative itch. However, I often felt that the game wasn't using its exploration elements as well as it could. Quests can only really reward you with money and gear; money always gets hoovered by buying new, better gear from shopkeepers, and gear almost always becomes obsolete as soon as your characters level up. I found myself picking up really cool, unique gear, only for it to be  immediately  replaced by something slightly better. This is on top of a loot system that leaves your inventory constantly cluttered with random garbage, and forces you to check every single empty crate just in case there's a scroll of resurrection inside. I swear, Rivellon has an epidemic of empty crates.  In short, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a  very good game.  My biggest complaints are with the little things. The combat is just a little to obtuse, the exploration is just a little too unimportant, etc. The good things far, far outweigh the bad. If you're a fan of CRPGs, like games that focus on the story, or enjoy tactical combat, this game is an excellent buy."

Ridiculous Primate,17,2,0,"October 30, 2017",Recommended,276.4,"This game is one of my favorites of all time now. The world is immersive and beautiful.  The battles are challenging yet rewarding.  I played through it on Tactician mode  out of the gate because I beat the first game on Tactician mode and figured I'd master this in no time too.  The difficulty was surprising at times.  But one thing that I really liked about the difficulty was that it didn't rely on RNG for everything.  There are a few RNG elements, but for the most part the fights are designed to be beaten by strategy and predicting what the enemies would do. The over arching story was pretty classic, but what made me really love it was the companion stories.  They were really interesting and I really loved them.  Some people on here have commented that the companions don't interact much, and while I would have loved for them to interact more than they did, I feel like their stories cross over a lot.  For example Sebille and the Red Prince's stories straight up merge near the end if you are playing with them both in the party. I would suggest taking Lohse in your party too, because her personal quest is one of the best. I know there are still some bugs, and those can be frustrating. I know it uses some classic tropes, but classic tropes are classic for a reason.  Sometimes when you try  to reinvent the wheel you end up making a block of rock. The game also does successfully reinvent the wheel at a few points. I played it all through tactician mode and felt it was a good difficulty considering I took the hardest option.  If you are playing a game on the hardest setting you should expect to have to fight some fights multiple times to master them, and it makes me so happy that I never felt like I was just flipping a coin to win a fight.  Every decision in fights matters a lot. It's not a perfect game, but no game has ever been perfect.  This game is pretty damn good though, and if they fixed the broken quests and bugs I would put it in my top 5 RPGs instantly.  My major complaint about this game is that there isn't more of it.  I can't wait for some DLC."
Atara Mos,174,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,147.3,"I had played the prior game and was encouraged to pick this game up in Beta because of the promise of having more than just one friend join you. In the Beta alone I have over 30 hours of play time, and we barely got out of the first area. That isn't a bad thing at all! That is a testament to the variety of ways that you can do things. We wanted to try all the different classes, the different racial traits, the different talents. The addition of a single talent can entirely change how the story plays out, which dramatically increases replayability. You're presented with multiple ways to resolve your quests, and each are different and can have influence on multiple aspects of your character. Despite the 30+ hours in beta I still found entirely new things in release.  The story is rich and deep because of how so much of your character influences different interactions and what you find along the way. The combat being turn based is a lot more thoughtful than just running up and bashing your strongest skill, you can truly use the environment to your advantage, or accidentally screw yourself over with it if you aren't careful.  It really harkens back to the classic rpgs of the past in such a great way.  My only real critique is that the learning curve is sort of steep to start, camera movement isn't the most intuitive and takes a bit to figure out the finessing of it, as the tutorial is minimal. This can lead to some funny interactions, though, as you figure out that maybe red outlined things aren't the best thing to click on with others around."
No Name Salted Butter,156,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,62.7,"Easily one of the best RPG's ever made.  To me it has a feel similar to the fable titles with the freedom you get (within reason) during a dungeon and dragons session.   The combat is tactical and challenging while also rewarding, the characters are interesting, the world is beautiful and fleshed out, and overall the game once it was fully released is polished and well worth the wait and money put into it.   The game master mode is also a welcomed addition, only adds to value of the game."
NumbTongue,262,2,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,28.4,Possibly the very first game to truly mimick most of the best aspects of pen and paper D&D with it's unique Game Master Mode. I honestly can't wait to get a group together and play this.
Mahebra,291,2,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,238.5,"Improves on the original in every way.  Original Sin 1 was probably one of the best CRPGs I had ever played to that date, and I could find little to no flaws with it, many of which were improved upon in the Enhanced Edition of the game.   Original Sin 2 somehow manages to take that mastercraft and make it even better, the new systems and mechanics implemented in such a way that I find it almost hard to return to the original. I have spent an absurd amount of time on the Early Access alone, and cannot believe the amount of variety and feasability to the different ways to approach each situation.   I was a bit taken back by the new changes to the armor system -- having physical and/or magical armor protects you (and your enemies) from those CC abilities, which made the first game a bit of a race to CC the enemies before they could do it to you. Original Sin 2 found a interesting way to handle that, and building your team and skillset to tackle this new problem has made the combat far more interesting and more satisfying, while not over complicating things. Instead of a party make-up being almost required, you're now a bit more free to experiment with your set up, and the changes to the skill system allows you to experiment more with being a hybrid build, instead of having to take a strict path in order to maximize gains.  This game seems far more friendly to newer players, while still keeping much of the spice and charm that I've come to expect and love from Larian, and this newest entry has done nothing but please and delight me."
loved london in 1666,46,2,1,"October 25, 2017",Recommended,86.6,"So honestly i pirated this game for the first time, just to see it, I tried lots and lots of these type of games strategies and so. I could never get into it, it just never catch me, I've heard a lot of good reviews of this game but still not enough to risk and buy game i never loved genre of. So I pirated it and just fell in love in the first second. I clicked on the skull and hearrd my character  react, almost on everything, almost every single one. It took like few minutes I explored very first room, than I deleted illegal version and bought it. First I want to say that difficulty system is quiet♥♥♥♥♥♥ you have the first one, which is for completely noobs like me, but when I learnt some and wanted more competitive gameplay, the next difficulty was too hard, of course for people who had experience in genre. In other ways, the game is amazing, almost all quests you have TONS of possibilities to complete it, or to fail it, or to... avoid it? And when you understand it, in your very first hour, it wakes your curiousity, you start seeking every corner for gameplay pieces, dialogues, you start fast-saving to see all ways of conversations. I am wasting hours in this game, reading all books, my own journal, and still into it. The story is actually very obivious and classic for fantasy. If you read mass fantasy books, movies etc the story will be extremely predictable and boring, but that doesnt make game boring cause of reasons I mentioned above. By playing this game I learnt basics of this genre, and enjoyed already 20 with some hours and ready for much much more. Of course this game has big potention because of simple replayability, and mod support.  Overall I can rate this game on few fields: Story: 5/10 - It is REALLY typical, but still it has good telling Graphics: 7/10 - I know texture quality is not the first criteria rating strategy games, but still it is not very bad, but unlikely most cool texture quality games it looks really beautiful, bright and contrast perfectly balanced. It adds a big load of atmosphere. Gameplay: 10/10 - Basicly not because of this step-by-step, this gameplay actually never different a lot from other games in the genre, because of the variaty and the high quality in every single second in your gameplay, and you will see it, just as you jump in the game.  Buy it, really, you are wasting your time watching reviews or pirating just like i did."

The Ridiculous Rav,241,2,0,"September 25, 2017",Recommended,48.4,"I like it, but buyer beware it doesn't play like a ""modern"" RPG at all. It's really tough, but the non-combat gameplay is so encompassing that I can almost overlook it.  I'm playing on the 2nd easiest difficulty, and I've spent most of my time playing this game just trying to beat the first three fights. All the fights are so difficult that I have to save-scrub each of them multiple times; I can't imagine how hard playing this on the hardest difficulty is.  Super in-depth lore, lots of stuff to be engrossed inside. The world feels a lot like a less grim Path-of-Exile (you're sent to a prison island), which I like a lot.  I'm about to restart the game on the easiest difficulty. I'm not super into RTS or ""Strategy"" games, but I do like RPG's. I'd recommend people who haven't played Divinity Original Sin 1 to do the same, and if you think the game is too easy after the first few fights just amp up the difficulty."

StolenMadWolf,91,2,0,"September 10, 2017",Recommended,93.6,"Okay, this review is way overdue, but I wanted to take all the time I need to fully explore this game before getting it up. This proved more difficult than I hoped for a few different reasons and I’ve decided just to take what I have got and get this review up now. Because this game deserves the praise. I did a review for the beta, and to be honest, not much can be changed from that previous one. But I will try and do a change up and update.  In DOS 2, you play as a Sourcer, an individual able to use a powerful magic known as Source. Unfortunately for you at the time of the game, said magic has some negative issues and you are persecuted and rounded up for 'curing'. Naturally, there is more to you then meets the eye, and your certainly not planning on sticking around for the 'cure'. This evolves into a deep and complex plot as you go on a quest not only to save the world, but to become the next divine, a form of demi-god. Only thing is, only one of four characters can be that.  Starting off with gameplay, first off, you have excellent roleplaying potential. You can select one of a few origin stories or create your own custom character, with their own origins, starting abilities and ‘tags’, which offer additional dialogue options and opens up several possibilities in interactions. There are no classes in the game (the 'classes' you pick at the start of the game only really define your starting abilities, stats and maybe appearance.) which coupled with the simple, but very nicely done customisation system and wide range and freedom of dialogue lets you create the character you want to roleplay as in game. This is especially true with the ability to play the game you want to play it. Be a noble knight? Check. Be an anti-heroic rogue? Check. Kill every sucker in sight for the lols? Well, not everyone so you don't break the game, but check. Which leads me onto the combat. I love it. It's the good old fashioned slow-paced turn based gameplay that is so rarely used nowadays outside of some specific games. You can use basic attacks, abilities, consumables and magic to fight your way through your encounters, or, with a bit of luck, avoid them. You can utilise your abilities and the environment to create powerful combinations for attack and defence and there is a great deal of strategy and tactics to be had, encouraging you to think before you act. When you win a tough battle, you feel a sense of relief and of course, the feeling of being a badass.  Also, unlike many RPGs, especially amongst the older ones and the MMO's, the game is complex enough to make you think and to make you invest time into the game, but simple enough not to confuse you or tire you out and hence allow you to stay immersed. Few games can get that balance right.  Couple the roleplaying and combat together along with companions with different relationship values, and boom, you have the ideal combat roleplaying game ready to go. Even better though is the fact that whilst you can play the game solo, on your own or with a playable NPC party. You can also bring in three other players in on your campaign adventure with their own characters. The possibilities of cooperation, backstabbing, competition, friendship and the occasional bit of griefing or trolling with four human players is endless. All in all, by pure basic gameplay along, it’s utterly fantastic solo or with a group of friends.  There is a catch to this though… this game can be insanely hard, at least initially. The enemy plays smart and can wipe the floor with you if you’re not careful. Once you start getting reasonable equipment, abilities and spells you start to find yourself increasingly able to slaughter your way through most of your opponents… until you hit the bigger fights and the bosses, in which case, you promptly start getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked, even on the lowest difficulty so be ready to save scum and rerun fights. Unfortunately, some quests and fights can feel just unfair at times regardless of where you are at, so be careful.  The campaign for DOS 2 is deep, complex and gripping, always encouraging you to continue playing through to the end. It has excellent characters and voice acting, coupled in with an unpredictable and well-done story with multiple endings with variations. It certain stands out as a solid campaign with numerous sub quests and side stories alongside the main one, couple this in with a natural inclination to explore the map, and you soon find yourself more than happily working to complete whatever you can find. The story’s one real weakness is that it suffers Halo 4 syndrome. Anyone familiar with the series will quickly get the gist of the plot, events and characters, whilst newcomers will be left scratching their heads as they try and get a better understanding of setting. Thankfully, a lot of this is covered as you progress through the game and you will soon get an understanding of the story and setting, which is solid enough to stand on its own two feet. The campaign is strong throughout Acts 1-3 but weakens in Act 4 due to some almost unfair and annoying quests, situations and fights, but the very final segment makes up for it.  I was able to complete the campaign on the easiest difficulty in about 40 hours, probably a little bit longer. You could do it quicker, but I wouldn’t recommend it if you want to have an easier time with fighting opponents. However, with multiple companions, replayability is definitely a thing with the game. I recommend playing the game at least three times. Once with your own character and three origin companions, once with the origin characters you didn’t pick and an previously used origin character of your choice and a third playthrough in Coop, so you get your money’s worth in the campaign by time alone.  Now, it’s not just the campaign. The developers went a step further and adding in a competitive multiplayer versus mode called arena, where you and other players fight each other alongside a custom campaign mode called Gamemaster, where you can play campaigns made by yourself or other players. Unfortunately, at the time of this review, games with random people are almost impossible in these modes and likely the campaign too. Every match is either full, empty or has one guy AFK, so in the end, I was only able to get one arena match in. It feels much like the regular campaign, but it’s a nice thought and addition. I wasn’t even able to go and play with Gamemaster at all. So you are going to need to organise with friends to full try that out. However, they are worthy additions which will add a few more hours to the game.  In addition, the art design, sound effects and the music deserve A*-grade damn rewards. This game is staggeringly beautiful to behold with excellent music through the different stages to immerse you into the world.  As a bonus, the game seems free of bugs and runs well on decent computers, even very low spec PCs and laptops have been able to run it, but be careful with the lower spec PCs. I did notice that as I progressed through the campaign, I did start getting performance drops, lag and even near crashes by the time I reached the last few hours of the game, luckily though, I suffered no crashes, though I came close on occasion. Just be warned.  All in all, Divinity Original Sin 2 is an utterly fantastic game that is worth every penny, even if you just play the campaign, you will get your money’s worth and it gets better with friends. If you are a fan of roleplay and strategy, and are willing to put up with the extremely difficult encounters, this game deserves a place in your library. The challenge and weaker Act 4 stops me from giving the game 10/10, but it still earns 9/10 and my own Wolfy seal of approval. I implore you to get this game. Trust me, you won’t regret it."

Rhythm Rug,114,2,0,February 7,Recommended,94.6,"I don't usually write reviews for games but this one deserves one. From the get go this game is absolutley stunning from graphics to gameplay and everything in between. The music captures each moment and truly adds to atmosphere of the game. The leveling is great and makes you feel like you earned each skill and source point. The map is huge and just keeps on giving. The story is fantastic and immersive, it takes you in to the world and makes you feel apart of it. The ending of the game truly makes you feel like what you accomplished throughout the game actually mattered, each quest and storyline had a purpose. The little easter eggs hidden in the game makes you feel like the developers are in touch with the playerbase and just add enjoyment to the game.   The great thing about this is the game does not stop there, with the DM mode at your fingertips you can grab your friends and make your own story. The workshop content is great and I can't wait to try out all the mods and different stories that are coming out. The game just keeps on giving. The reason I even wrote this review is because the developers deserve every bit of credit and praise they are given, this is what gaming is supposed to look like and more developers need to take note. If you are on my friends list and reading this and are still on the edge, message me and I will continue to rant about how good this game is. To everyone else, if you enjoy these types of RPGs, its a no brainer. To those who don't know if they will enjoy this genre or type of game, I was also in this boat, but damn if it wasn't a good pick up."

Sidequests are interesting, and exploring new locations is fun , although, almost all puzzles and exploration can be bypassed by teleportation spells. During my 80 hours playthrough, I've encountered only few bugs, non of them were game-breaking, and all could be solved by reloading my last save file. 9,5/10"

exoroyal,247,2,0,February 24,Recommended,86.7,"After I played The Witcher 3 the way I see RPG and Action RPG games changed. Now I want more and most games don't give me what i want. Games that I used to love are just meh to me now.  After playing Divinity Original Sin and Divinity Original Sin 2 (I played them back to back) I must say the way I view RPG's changed again... This is one of the best games a ever played. The story is great, the gameplay is fantastic. Really solid game.  The only thing that makes me sad is that I think the lore of the games seems to be a little inconsistent and I can't find about it much on the web. For example the name Braccus Rex is dropped left and right during these games but all I know is that he is a king that lived thousands of years ago and he was bad.  Dispite that this game is a 11/10"

I can't believe I missed out on this months ago, ..*kicking myself* I bought it again and gave it the time it deserved, very rarely do I get past a few hours in any game before my flighty attention span is used up.  This game is a diamond! 40+ hours in and I dont want it to end!  If you're n the fence about this, just buy it, it is insanely good!

Noobsauce,83,2,0,February 18,Recommended,335.0,"Pros:  Amazing roleplaying/DnD feel. Interesting characters, witty writing, and I haven't played a game that left you this many choices since Fallout New Vegas (almost anyone can be killed at any time). Highly recommend playing one of the ""Origin"" players, or if not, at least having them as your party members, a lot of the great story telling revolves around them.  Combat system is fun and allows for a lot of theory crafting/playstyles, to the point where even people who dont' care about the RP aspect of it at all still enjoy this game. Few gripes with certain aspets but overall it feels interesting/diverse. Fights are HARD, even on normal difficulty, but far from unbeatable.   This game handles multiplayer in what is essentially a single player world better than any other game I've ever seen. The game is coded like an MMO, so you and your friends can travel hafl way across the world in a random pub and your friend can still play their game. Seemlessly allows you to hop in and out of someone's game too.  Cons:  Some weird quirks with combat that could be improved (fighting with characters while others are in dialogue, main attributes feeling uninterseting), but really this is just a tiny complaint.  In the mid part of the game it's easy to lose focus, it's so open world that you can get bogged with side quests and forget what you were supposed to be doing in the first place.  Crafting system/Inventory system feels a little meh. Crafting can honestly be 100% ignored so this  doesn't detract from the game too much, but organizing /sorting through your inventory can feel tedious at times."

Antoinette,131,2,0,April 13,Recommended,215.2,"First time writing a review and wow does this game absolutely deserve it.  If you're a fan of cRPG's in any sense (think Baulder's Gate) you will absolutely love this.   The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, the graphics are great, the gameplay is where it REALLY shines. The fights are difficult, the AI is actually smart, and tactician will put your characters through a grinder when you thought you had it down.  At no point in the game did I feel like it was a slog or a chore to get through during my first playthrough, there was always something meaningful I could do. Just one more side quest before the main story, helping out this one person, talking to this one chicken. The story is also very well done, I feel as though I could actually talk to the characters if they were real people, they are fleshed out very well.   Larian is an extremely awesome company, they delayed the release of the game to add in a fully voiced game due to community request. They listen to their customers, apply the feedback properly, and keep them updated. Definitely the best game company out there right now.  The first act is a very good tutorial, the second act builds the world and the story, and act 3 and 4 take the fun of those two and multiply it by 5. I don't have enough good things to say about this game. The only negative is that it has now ruined so many others for me, because they won't be as good as this. Now I'm bored and don't know what else to start playing.   Ratings: Music: 15/10 (seriously the soundtrack is THAT good) Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Difficulty: 10/10 (has difficulties for all levels of players)  Overall it is a top 3 game that I have ever played.

It's really that great if you into RPG stuff. If you not it's the best place to start. If you have friends who would like to play it with you, it will be your GOTY, for sure.  Pros: Great graphics. One of the best fantasy soundtracks in gaming history. Great campaign with funny, intense moments, scary and entertaining moments. Great writing and overall plot. Huge replayability. Awesome tactical combats. Complex and flexible character building. The best implementation of the coop gameplay in all RPGs ever. Game Master mode for those who would like to play with their friends even after the campaign. A great mod tool that allows you do almost anything in the game. If you willing to spend some time off cause. Content in the game for 100+ hours minimum. Arena PVP mode exists.  Cons: The game still has some bugs. Though all great RPGs has and developers are working really hard fixing them. GM mode could have more love. It lacks a lot of crucial features and a lot of things that exist in the game are unavailable. Though mods in the workshop can help with fixing some of them. Arena PVP mode could have even more love. It's very primitive and it seems like developers haven't worked much on it. Hope they will improve it in the future.  Should you buy it? Definitely!"

Eilik,609,2,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,132.4,"I'm just writing a very brief review, in no way am I actually giving this game justice with my words, but I feel I have to write something as this game has consumed my life for the past 4 or 5 days.  Let's get started with the fact that I have not played any of the previous Divinity games, however I am a huge fan of CRPGs, stemming from the time I originally sat down and played the Dungeons and Dragons dungeon crawler: Pool of Raidiance - Ruins of Myth Drannor. Since that time I had backtracked, played through Neverwinter 1 and 2, though never actually completing them, as well as Wasteland, the Fallout series, pretty much most of the 'mainstream' crpgs most people are familiar with.  A few days ago a friend tossed me this game as a gift, honestly I am very thankful as this game has breathed new life into my fascination to this genre.  From the get go, the game is not forgiving, if you ignore obvious signs, you will die. Even on the normal difficulties if you lack in perception, the game has no qualm about stamping your expectations in the dust. And even if you are paying attention, it still does so. The way it handles ground effects, along with most spells being aoe, and actually having an impact. So you better think twice about casting that poison spell with your undead mage because he may be low health, but you may end up be using 3 resurrection scrolls instead of just one. Or you may send the dominoes of chaos smashing together to kill literally everything on the battlefield, as well as yourself.  Difficulty doesn't spike horribly though, once you get the hang of things, it's actually a breeze if you're used to any kind of tactics, especially in classic mode. Though I give credit to the enemy AI. There are times they are smarter than their own good, geeking the mage rather than going after my tanky knight front and center.  However this is a downside as well, because if my undead is under an enchantment to appear for all intensive purposes, as an elf. How yould you know it was undead to cast that heal spell on it?  But I digress, I have 60 hours in the game, I had finally after a lot of exploration started exploring the place after the initial island, and I am loving the game even more. Again, this isn't even half of my feelings, there are obviously some negatives, but they have already been stated by someone else, or I feel they are not an issue.  I heartily reccomend, I got it as a gift, and I actually wish I had been able to buy it myself."

You are somewhat free how you overcome certain challenges (sneaking, plain combat, hidden entry, talking, persuasion.........) +Consequences of your choices +FULL VOICE ACTING. Everything is voice acted, from the narrator to every little npc you see. It gives a great sense of immersion.   -very difficult for new players to the genre, no handholding (which is a good thing imo) -the inventory is a clusterf**k. If you arent somewhat patient, you will hate it -quirky dialogue sometimes, this can be seen as positive or negative, Id appreciate a more serious tone, though, it keeps a good balance -colors too bright imo  Thats just the things on top of my head. For every rpg fan, especially oldschool pnp or crpgs fans or just people with a little bit of patience, you re in for a GREAT time. Getting back the feeling of playing nonstop without getting bored.

Draenei For Life (Josh),239,2,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,105.4,"GAME OF THE YEAR FOR ME. ALSO if you play this game keep the black cat alive, trust me its so worth it.   SO the good things about this game: The story/writing has vastly been improved saince the first game, I loved the first one but the story never really pulled me in, this one however pulls me in within the first hour. The combat is still as fun and tactical as the first, with far more combinations of spells and abilities (plus waaayyy more spells, classes and abilities in general). The character creation is fun, its not too long and crazy but allows you to make (or customize an existing character) to be the character you wanna play. The companions are all detailed with decent stories and they all have different impacts on the storyline and each other. Gamemaster Mode is incredible fun, it feels like the D&D campaign creator I've always wanted. This game has up to 4 player multiplayer for the full game, so if you have the friends jump into this with them.   Few neutral things: The music is kind of average, a few fun tunes but feels generic. The crafting system is no longer a cluster of confusing rubbish, so its not a negative, it still doesn't feel very important though, on my solo playthrough and playthrough with friend we both ignore it as it feels still not that useful. Arena mode is a rare giggle but feels kind of incomplete. While its very true many quests allow you to do them  in different ways which is fab, some of them matter little, you will be given like 5 options (if you find them all) to finish a certain part however, you can just run back and do the other options for extra xp for killing them (as I do) making the choice slightly pointless.  Bad things for me (or things I think others will hate): The amount of races is fun (including undead versions), however, it feels like every race is here in vast quantities, no race feels rarer. If you do not like turn based combat this game is NOT FOR YOU AT ALL. Your characters pathing when you tell them to go someone in a fight will still decide to  casually run through fire/poison etc, or sometimes attacks of opportunity make ZERO sense. Gamemaster Mode has no way of making character talk, its all up to the GM. Now this last comment is something that just personally annoys me, but when you need to  help a character in a fight (or save them) they have this tendency to just go full in and take huge quantities of damage, they seem to have dumb AI compared to actual enemies.  I hope my review gave some insight on whether to purchase this game."

Inferiae,102,2,0,"October 9, 2016",Recommended,175.2,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an improvement over it's predecessor in pretty much every aspect. To keep it simple, here's what the original game done so well that was fantastic  - Fantastic Turn-Based Tactical Combat - Compelling Narrative  - No Handholding Approach to World Design - Challenging Encounters  - Beautiful Hand-Crafted World  The sequel improves on the above in pretty much every way but tweaks the formula  - 4 races to pick between and a 5th to come soon - Smarter AI, you can no longer butcher and steal while NPC's lick windows - Better pacing - Combat feels better all round, movement is punished less, animations feel tighter and the armour mechanic means you get CC cheesed a lot less  All round despite being an Alpha it's incredibly playable and I've noticed only minor bugs.

Harivdee,26,2,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,220.8,What can I say about this game. If you like this genre then its a no brainer.  If you dont like this genre or the lore/style I would ask to reconsider.  Try Path of Exile which is free and if you're have the least amount of fun on that game that means you will have 1000x fun in this one.  So many game modes and possibilities this game shows great promise and at a tremendous quality.  10/10.

The best game I've ever played, beating out Divinity: Original Sin by several hairs.   The combat is phenomenal - would love to see a whole plethora of games with similar mechanics, if they could be similarly deep and balanced.  Similar but better than the turn-based gridded games I know - Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy tactics, Advance Wars. These were rough, alpha attempts that were not inspired enough to thresh out the real strategic possiblilities of turn-based gaming, to great depth.   Also just feels good - taking control of and building your characters in this game is particularly rewarding. You know and love them, and become intimately familiar with their capabilities even as throughout they grow in fits and spurts into more powerful, novel, and complicatedly effective beings. Integrating new abilities, talents, and stat proclivities into them is a meaningful test of your tactical control. Choosing those is a test of your strategic wisdom."

LEVEL 5 DWARF,230,2,0,September 14,Recommended,90.3,"Overall recommended, but its widely known the last 25% of the game is generally disliked or at least not liked as well as the rest.  The first two acts are amazing, then the next two seem like they needed to ship product. I'd complain if i hadn't spent (guessing) 40 hours on the first two acts which are totally worth the money.  Yes the ending is terrible (I literally got an ending scene that i did not pick, yes several plot lines were not finished, yes there are more secret levers in act 4 than believable, yes the last fight is one which it's a totally valid not doing it and just watching the youtube.  That said, i recommend.  I assume the new version of the game has fixed these issues or at least the big ones, but as the old saves were incompatible and i was just into act 3, i didn't restart to find out."

Epicjynx,155,2,0,February 12,Recommended,65.0,"Great game, a true RPG and the closest thing to a Dungeons and Dragons video game. There is so much to do in this game, every location has secrets, every NPC can be interacted with (and is voice acted, spectacularly I might add) even animals can be talked to with a certain ability, every quest is written masterfully, and the combat is what all turn based games should strive to be.  I only have 2 complaints, the first is about performance. This game stutters a lot while not being the most graphically impressing and takes up a lot of RAM use. Load times are fairly long and sometimes the sound cuts out for up to 30 seconds.  The second is about multiplayer. It's unplayable for me, after a while it's impossible to connect to an old save, the only way to play is start a new save everytime.  Other than that the game is fantastic, just wish they fixed these issues."

The music help set's the scene and fits in beautifully with the game. The AI is rather smart and can be quite difficult to overcome in some battles but persistence is a key.

Snardbuckett,227,2,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,626.6,"At first i was quite apprehensive, i played the game at a friends house in beta and i did not like the direction the game was going at first. The original armor system was akin to mass effect 2 and it felt very rock paper scissors like .... Thanksfully shy of release they made a drastic change in how armor works and he new system is quite refreshing and i like it.  the addition of a band of characters who are not blank slates while still being customizable for how you mechnically want to play the game was freaking brilliant. I love specifically Fane and Lfan the most but all of the characters are this fantastic dichotomy of being terrible people yet relatable people that seem like thier actions are primarily tainted by being on the wrong side of a ""very bad day"".  i think they did  aslightly better job of making it somewhat apparent where and what you needed to do from the get go and the ""tutorial"" section on the ship is great, playing throught the turtorial is drastically better than a pile of exposition to tell you how to play an RPG from the ground up.  Im not 100% sold on the new skill system as better, but it certainly is fluid and doent punish you as harshly for side speccing, i also like that crafting does not require skill investment and that the ""Civil"" skills have been split off so you dont have to try to choose between skewering harder or not sounding like a neanderthal in conversation.  I do however wish crafting seemed more impactful at low levels .... custom crafting your weapons and getting ahead of the curve through exploration theft and smart trading was quite fun in OS1. i find that somewhat removed in OS2 and most crafting early game is primarily for ""consumables"" and the customization of old on your own crafted weapons seems somewhat limited (using essences to add a damage type)  the introduction of more playable character races is a welcome change and the tag system really amps up the replayability to 11. I definitely agree with the sentiment its one of the best game sof the year quite possibly the best yet."

The Cons:  .There are a few bugs (turns taking a while to end) but nothing major .It was released without some languages installed last minute, boo hoo most people work so couldnt even play it on release anyway .Look at the negative reviews, 95% of them are ridiculious  Pros: .Everything! The freedom, the charachter creation, the gameplay and the massively in-depth story. .Dont like somebody? be it good or bad, no problem you can just kill them!  If you like turn-based or classic RPG's this is the new King of the Genre.  Larian are the best most honest development studio ever (i kickstartered both their Original sin titles) if they make a mistake they let you know and keep you updated.  10/10 i will buy any larian game in a hearbeat. <------take note ubisoft/EA this is how you make a good game."

Old Man Pizza Tony,124,2,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,127.4,"I have been playing this game since EA last year. Not religiously, mind you. But loading it up after just about every patch and playing Act 1 with my buddy. It has changed a lot since last December, and all of it for the better. I will mostly try to cover the changes since Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition, which I played through several times with a friend on Xbox One. I have not beat this game yet, and I probably won't for another 100+ hours. I am running multiple concurrent playthroughs with several friends and that takes an inordinate amount of time with how I play.  The tone of this game is not vastly different than the orignal, but it is different enough. No more vendors are yelling at you about cheese or entussling scrolls. The supporting cast is overall less goofy. You don't run into an obnoxious Goblin in the player housing and the new supporting cast is about 20x more interesting, despite the slightly more serious tone. The voice acting is stellar and a major surprise that it even happened at all, considering the vast amount of dialogue. Every character feels distinct and makes me want to talk to them. There are plenty of funny little dialogue throwbacks to weird little things that happened in the first game. From a talking skull in the very first area, a Dragon Commander character in Act 1, being scolded for looking for needles in haystacks, to references to Arhu in a random book 99% of players will never read. The narrator's voice is on point with inflection and appropriate humour for every dialogue option so far. I seriously cannot state how amazing the voice actors are in this game. There are just as many jokes and funny choices in this game as the first, neat sidequests, and funny names abound. They are just more in line with the slightly more serious tone of this game. The companions don't have absurd names like Bairdotr, but they are still colorful and interesting. They have their own goals and interact with the game world in very different ways.   Combat is infintely improved. High ground is decisive in victory, range combat is king, and making pure physical/magic builds is necessary for CC'ing high level enemies. No more RNG exists for crowd controlling enemies. It is based on depletable magical and physical armor. The armor values do not regenerate without special skills, but if you are making a solid build, there are ways to replenish this. The AI is smarter and know to avoid retribution builds, to target high DPS weak characters, and path around ground hazards. They pull neat tricks that only a player would have done in DoS:1. They set up combos turns in advance and enemy parties have really good synergy. Despite all this, the combat feels fair. They work within the confines of the game and the skills are very well explained. If you find your build is lackluster, that is fine, respeccing is free and readily available in Act 2. The build diversity is insane. Splashing for utility is extremely viable and necessary. Pure builds work in almost all encounters. I love the fact that everything but Rogue is usable. Memory is a huge cahnge, you can learn every single skill that your stats allow, but cannot put them on your bar unless you have enough memory slots to learn the skills. This does restrict how many spells you can use at once, but it is also balanced and the whole game is built around it. this is not a bad change, but it is a major one.  The biggest and best change is the removal of crafting as a skill. Anyone can utilize materials found without having to waste valuable points. Stealing art is still a valuable way to make money. I don't know how anyone could even play this game without a dedicated thief character. The game is not Skyrim, you simply cannot do everything in one playthrough. So many choices will fully lock you out of dialogue trees or quests. Not in a restrictive way, but in a lore-friendsly and realistic way.   If you want an RPG that has stellar combat, engaging dialogue, and love lots of reading, this game is for you. This game is not for everyone, and just because it wasn't made for you, does not mean this game is not a masterpiece."

So much to do and see it's insane, not to mention voice acting almost every line in the game. This is one of the best RPGs I've played and it deserves the praise."
NightSn1PeR,245,2,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,178.2,"Best thing wich happend with CRPG genre for last years so far. Game contains ideal mix of oldschool and new-gen design decisions wich makes game pleasurable to play for both generations. Soo much content wich always have few ways to be done. Some quests require brain activity but doesnt overcomplicate with them. Exploring part is rewarding your eagle eye. Origin characters which written really well and can affect main story. Music was enjoyable even for me and i'm not a fan of fantasy themes. Even if game has some weak or bad moments they will never overcome all good stuff in that piece of art. And i think its first time in my life when game deserves max possible grade.    ""Masterpiece of genre in game industry"" "

Thank you Larian for creating such wonderful games. I simply cannot wait to see what you guys come up with next - but until then, I will go back and get lost in the world of Rivellon."

Scooty,51,2,0,September 5,Recommended,56.6,"Not a title for 100%ers or the very tactical.  This is fun on it's own AND there is a Dungeon Master mode I havnt used yet. Downside is sort of strange fiction where clerics heal by sucking blood off the ground? Very detailed but still odd to me. Fun game.  I'm having an issue where I get jumped by badguys near the edge of town. I run into town and stand next to a town guard.  I stay in combat because exiting teleports you like fast travel. He is still out there watching me get beaten down in front of him while never ever attacking the guy burning EVERYTHING. (the fire does nothing to the guards and townsfolk not in combat yet hugging)  So there is that. Still a good game.  This is quickly turning into a feces title.  In sneak as a barrel tucked in a corner behind a tent BUT the guard detect vision goes through that type of object.   So much saving and loading because of lack of polish.  For instance just now; a fading mine that cloaks when your near.  -I saw it and manuver my man to a point where straight line in a safe corridor was the direct path. -I click the destination and my digidal dynamo heads off straight as an arrow like planned, only to vear 45* left straight into the mine blowing it and dodging a terrifying patch of THIN AIR!

There'll be a lot of reading, but it wasn't designed to bore you out, and with less of hints thrown at you like most AAA games, you'll feel the sense of fulfilment when finally finish a quest that seems so obscure.

We killed one of the bosses by turning all of the blood in a room into poison and then teleporting a candle into the poison, blowing up all of the enemies.

Nethys/BlackViking,335,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,80.9,"The Co-op is pretty fantastic, with split screen and online gameplay available. 4-player Co-op is huge, especially when each character has their own backstories, motives, and alignments. Some quests mean you gotta talk to someone, someone else may want that person dead. Sometimes you even gotta fight your friends in a fun arena-style system. Combat is amazing, especially when you have the turn-based gameplay to help stage brutal combos to dispatch multiple enemies. From exploiting elements, to staging ambushes for the enemy you just turned into a chicken, the options are vast. Story so far is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good. As I stated initially, everyone has their own upbringings and goals that sometimes conflict or align at various parts of the plot. While the beginning of the game seems very linear (""We gotta get out of this place!"") The variety of methods and questlines to accomplish that is guaranteed to bring in a second playthrough. I recommend this game to people who enjoy co-op gameplay, intricate stories, or just solid fantasy RPGs; this game has been a hit on all fronts for me and it feels good to play a sequel that just comes out better than the previous game.

Assuming you are not already familiar with the franchise, you might come across games media these days and be like ""what is this game and why does such an oldschool looking game peak at 86000 players on Steam?"" - well, the answer is so simple that I actually refuse to write a proper review for this game:   it is a an epic piece of art and a masterpiece of an rpg game.   Divinity: Original Sin 2 is on a level of quality and brilliance that only very few game studios have achieved so far. My respect to the belgian developers of Larian Studios, who are an amazing example of a studio crowdfunding games to deliver the best experience they possibly could. Personally I think this is the best RPG overall since the Witcher 3 and in a few years many RPG fans will mention both games in their favourite RPGs of this decade.   9.5/10 for me!    "

Psytric,191,2,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,44.2,"An absolutely stellar game.  One of the best cRPGs in years, with, in my opinion, the best combat system ever.  Pros: - Excellent writing - Great voice-acting - Absolutely spectactular combat  - Huge variation in character development - Multiple ways to accomplish just about any task - Tons of hidden gems secreted away throughout your journeys - A number of innovative systems, like the Physical/Magical armor system, companions whose class you can choose when they join your party, and many others - Great coop experience - Well executed battlefield construction - high ground, cover are very important concepts to utilize in combat with serious bonuses - Fantastic AI - Enemies and friends alike don't blunder through dangerous terrain, enemies use battlefield to great effect.  They will be your primary teachers as you learn how to fight. - Very pretty  Cons: - Huge character variability inevitably leads to steep learning curves for some encounters - Similarly variety will make you want to reroll and start over several times until you're happy with a party - AoE and surface generation can make it difficult to use classic magic user strategy. Friendly AoE generally owns party members as much as enemies - Some matchups can be brutal depending on your composition - Is your party mostly magic/poison damage?  Better hope you don't face undead...  Have mostly melee champs?  Those archers are going to ruin you... - Still a number of bugs, though mostly not gamebreaking and fixes are actively being worked on by Larian Studios  All in all,  you can't go wrong with this one.  Just an absolutely wonderful game, a real ""holy♥♥♥♥♥♥it's 4am"" experience that will infiltrate your dreams and daydreams."

StolenMadWolf,91,2,0,"September 10, 2017",Recommended,93.6,"Okay, this review is way overdue, but I wanted to take all the time I need to fully explore this game before getting it up. This proved more difficult than I hoped for a few different reasons and I’ve decided just to take what I have got and get this review up now. Because this game deserves the praise. I did a review for the beta, and to be honest, not much can be changed from that previous one. But I will try and do a change up and update.  In DOS 2, you play as a Sourcer, an individual able to use a powerful magic known as Source. Unfortunately for you at the time of the game, said magic has some negative issues and you are persecuted and rounded up for 'curing'. Naturally, there is more to you then meets the eye, and your certainly not planning on sticking around for the 'cure'. This evolves into a deep and complex plot as you go on a quest not only to save the world, but to become the next divine, a form of demi-god. Only thing is, only one of four characters can be that.  Starting off with gameplay, first off, you have excellent roleplaying potential. You can select one of a few origin stories or create your own custom character, with their own origins, starting abilities and ‘tags’, which offer additional dialogue options and opens up several possibilities in interactions. There are no classes in the game (the 'classes' you pick at the start of the game only really define your starting abilities, stats and maybe appearance.) which coupled with the simple, but very nicely done customisation system and wide range and freedom of dialogue lets you create the character you want to roleplay as in game. This is especially true with the ability to play the game you want to play it. Be a noble knight? Check. Be an anti-heroic rogue? Check. Kill every sucker in sight for the lols? Well, not everyone so you don't break the game, but check. Which leads me onto the combat. I love it. It's the good old fashioned slow-paced turn based gameplay that is so rarely used nowadays outside of some specific games. You can use basic attacks, abilities, consumables and magic to fight your way through your encounters, or, with a bit of luck, avoid them. You can utilise your abilities and the environment to create powerful combinations for attack and defence and there is a great deal of strategy and tactics to be had, encouraging you to think before you act. When you win a tough battle, you feel a sense of relief and of course, the feeling of being a badass.  Also, unlike many RPGs, especially amongst the older ones and the MMO's, the game is complex enough to make you think and to make you invest time into the game, but simple enough not to confuse you or tire you out and hence allow you to stay immersed. Few games can get that balance right.  Couple the roleplaying and combat together along with companions with different relationship values, and boom, you have the ideal combat roleplaying game ready to go. Even better though is the fact that whilst you can play the game solo, on your own or with a playable NPC party. You can also bring in three other players in on your campaign adventure with their own characters. The possibilities of cooperation, backstabbing, competition, friendship and the occasional bit of griefing or trolling with four human players is endless. All in all, by pure basic gameplay along, it’s utterly fantastic solo or with a group of friends.  There is a catch to this though… this game can be insanely hard, at least initially. The enemy plays smart and can wipe the floor with you if you’re not careful. Once you start getting reasonable equipment, abilities and spells you start to find yourself increasingly able to slaughter your way through most of your opponents… until you hit the bigger fights and the bosses, in which case, you promptly start getting your♥♥♥♥♥kicked, even on the lowest difficulty so be ready to save scum and rerun fights. Unfortunately, some quests and fights can feel just unfair at times regardless of where you are at, so be careful.  The campaign for DOS 2 is deep, complex and gripping, always encouraging you to continue playing through to the end. It has excellent characters and voice acting, coupled in with an unpredictable and well-done story with multiple endings with variations. It certain stands out as a solid campaign with numerous sub quests and side stories alongside the main one, couple this in with a natural inclination to explore the map, and you soon find yourself more than happily working to complete whatever you can find. The story’s one real weakness is that it suffers Halo 4 syndrome. Anyone familiar with the series will quickly get the gist of the plot, events and characters, whilst newcomers will be left scratching their heads as they try and get a better understanding of setting. Thankfully, a lot of this is covered as you progress through the game and you will soon get an understanding of the story and setting, which is solid enough to stand on its own two feet. The campaign is strong throughout Acts 1-3 but weakens in Act 4 due to some almost unfair and annoying quests, situations and fights, but the very final segment makes up for it.  I was able to complete the campaign on the easiest difficulty in about 40 hours, probably a little bit longer. You could do it quicker, but I wouldn’t recommend it if you want to have an easier time with fighting opponents. However, with multiple companions, replayability is definitely a thing with the game. I recommend playing the game at least three times. Once with your own character and three origin companions, once with the origin characters you didn’t pick and an previously used origin character of your choice and a third playthrough in Coop, so you get your money’s worth in the campaign by time alone.  Now, it’s not just the campaign. The developers went a step further and adding in a competitive multiplayer versus mode called arena, where you and other players fight each other alongside a custom campaign mode called Gamemaster, where you can play campaigns made by yourself or other players. Unfortunately, at the time of this review, games with random people are almost impossible in these modes and likely the campaign too. Every match is either full, empty or has one guy AFK, so in the end, I was only able to get one arena match in. It feels much like the regular campaign, but it’s a nice thought and addition. I wasn’t even able to go and play with Gamemaster at all. So you are going to need to organise with friends to full try that out. However, they are worthy additions which will add a few more hours to the game.  In addition, the art design, sound effects and the music deserve A*-grade damn rewards. This game is staggeringly beautiful to behold with excellent music through the different stages to immerse you into the world.  As a bonus, the game seems free of bugs and runs well on decent computers, even very low spec PCs and laptops have been able to run it, but be careful with the lower spec PCs. I did notice that as I progressed through the campaign, I did start getting performance drops, lag and even near crashes by the time I reached the last few hours of the game, luckily though, I suffered no crashes, though I came close on occasion. Just be warned.  All in all, Divinity Original Sin 2 is an utterly fantastic game that is worth every penny, even if you just play the campaign, you will get your money’s worth and it gets better with friends. If you are a fan of roleplay and strategy, and are willing to put up with the extremely difficult encounters, this game deserves a place in your library. The challenge and weaker Act 4 stops me from giving the game 10/10, but it still earns 9/10 and my own Wolfy seal of approval. I implore you to get this game. Trust me, you won’t regret it."

wally,143,2,0,January 17,Recommended,147.0,"This game is a veritable masterpiece, and I would wager the best game I have ever played. The sheer freedom you are offered and the extreme creative solutions you can use to figure out any and every puzzle, battle or even little distractions, is alone enough to make this purchase well worth it. But Larian Studios went above and beyond fully voice acting all 75k lines of dialogue. The game offers a unique take on combat, heavily focusing on the environment around you and how to use it to your advantage in combat, constantly fighting for highground, throwing barrels, or laying down sheets of slippery ice in order to barely claw through the fight. The combat offers insane depth and even offers an arena mode in which you can duel other players with custom parties. The story experience also offers a full drop in/drop out 4-player experience. Every player is free to do what they want and at times this can lead to conflicting goals and fighting between what the party will do.   Even with all of this to offer, Larian went even further and added a GM mode, which allows users to create custom campaigns and a game master to guide the groups adventure. This also comes with full steam workshop support, allowing you to mod the game as you wish.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is, I think, the best game ever created and I suggest that you purchase this work of art as soon as you are able."

I've never played Original Sin 1, but it is truly a nice RPG game. It's a turn-based game, u'd better know that before buying it. But don't just say, ""I don't like turn-based games."" U'd better watch videos about this game, then u'll find it much different from that u imagined before. When out of fights, u'll control your team like in the game Dungeon Siege, only when fighting the enemy will u control your team in a turn-based way. Also, I really enjoyed the beautiful views a lot, u'll know what I mean when u truly play the game. This game is fantastic for me. Looking forward to play all chapters of it. But there are also some bad things to tell u. There r no marks on the map which show u where u can finish your mission. And u cant see the characters from about 2 screen's distence. That means u have to go to every corner and use your mouse to see NPCs' names. This will truly take players a lot of time unless they remember where the NPC is on receiving the mission. This game is very expensive, I know that, but it's worth buying for those who r interested in turn-based games. I really don't want to see red comments like"" why is this game turn-based? I spent fu*** over 40 dollars for this rubbish?"" That's your problem! Why don't u look at the introduction before buying it? I love this game, but also hope that after this beta, they'll add some more languages. we all hope to enjoy the game in a much easier way. Many Chinese players bought this game.

Gergg,663,2,0,"September 8, 2017",Recommended,72.3,"An incredible game that promises to be even more amazing when it launches next week.  The combat really stands head-and-shoulders above other classic RPGs like Tyranny and Pillars of Eternity. So few RPGs of any type really manage to make it feel like what skill or spell you're using really matters. In D:OS2 even weak skills and spells can find their place in combat if they can create an advantage. Even the weakest fire spell can turn the tides if the enemy is standing in oil.  Let me share some fun moments with the AI.  I thought I could bamboozle the enemy by giving my main character the Zombie trait. This trait allows them to heal when poisoned but take damage from healing spells/skills/potions. I foolishly assumed that they wouldn't be able to take advantage of that but if anything it made my life harder. So many AI enemies have a basic ranged healing spell/skill, some of which will restore health over several turns. They were all too happy to use them on my character.  At some other point, I was flirting with a woman who was part of a band of thugs. We got along well and promised to meet up in the future. Shortly after that I♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off her boss by insisting that he free my elven kin. In the ensuing battle the woman I had wooed fought against her compatriots in order to help me. She burned alive in the fray and I vowed to take her diary with me for the rest of my days.  In another encounter I was well positioned to stave off the enemy with my tank. The enemy mage saw this and cast a spell on him that swapped his position with a caged demon. I had to spend precious turns bashing the cage door open to escape while my squishy mages scattered.  The game is packed with these kinds of fun moments and turns and those were all within the first couple hours of play. Larian took what already worked in D:OS, improved it, and then fixed a lot of what didn't work. I have no idea how the co-op is but I imagine it will be excellent."

I've got to say that this game is one of the best for its price range, there's so much content in this game its crazy and its all voice acted :DD. Larian studio's really out did themselves with this game, if I had completed every single possible side quest/content before the main story finishes we are looking into 150hours plus (on honour mode which I play) or 100 hours plus on any other difficulty whilst reading dialogue etc.. This game is best played with friends as the character interactions/dialogue is top notch and provide really fun role playing. However I played by myself as I wanted to get immersed and finish the game on the hardest difficulty due feelings of it being rushed if I played with more people.   it took me 52 hours to complete the game doing story mission only with 1 origin character story (Lohse completed) as well as critical side quests that are blocking my way to the main quest. I'm also playing on Honour Mode difficulty(if your whole party dies you save is wiped), basically I have to play very safe ( I died quarter way in the game, salty af).   This game is worth every penny and its price tag just beats some of AAA games on global top sellers on steam for content/replayability to price ratio.  I'm hoping for a Divinity: Original Sin 3 :DDDD, I loved the story in this :DDDD  Edited : I'm gonna head back into this game and finish all side quests as well as explore."

This game is packed full of content, deep combat, infinite replayablility, and good old tender loving care by a studio that clearly cares about their game just as much as we, the players, do.

I_Rock_Fiction,23,2,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,214.9,"Student Game Designer : Focus in UI/UX (Overall) 10/10     This is Hands down the best Turn based RPG i have ever played. Numerous improvements have been made since the last game (Divinity Original Sin). The Textures and animations are amazing. Also There seems to be a much more deep combo system compared to the last game which will make for some fantastic experamentation. Combat is still very interesting with most encounters resulting in different choices by the Enemy AI which ""spices"" up engagments.   Pros   The Characters and Dialoge are of course very good, with all of the origin characters having interesting backgrounds. your choices are questioned by your party memebers and many of them have different veiws, as they should.  The Skills and combos are fantastic and really fun to use although you will need to remember that your combos can be exploited or even used agaisnt you by the enemy Ai.  Armor and weapons look great and there seems to be a wide variety of different skins for each type of weapon.  While i did not explore the crafting system as much as i should have its pretty much the same as the last game. Although there are supposed to be way more (items etc) that we can craft.  The sound affects and the soundtrack are just as catchy and cool as last time. (GIVE ME THE SOUNDTRACK)  Cons.   Some enemy types have almost unfair adavantages against a party of any compsition, namley the undead and or necromancers/witches. Undead/ dark magic users, can both heal from poison and blood, as well as regular healing spells, which really just makes the battle alot longer than it needs to be. Ive never been a fan of undead being able to use the Hydro Healing spells. They should benfit from blood/poison fields/ spells only.  The Ui Still needs a bit of improvement as the item management system is still not that great. But is ok. It is very simplistic/minimalistic which is fine but we will need access to a universal chest of some sort to store our materials and such in. Or multiple backpacks will need to be equipped to carry most of your loot /items. Rather than turning one character into a pack mule or having lots of items spread out around multiple characters.      "

Ridiculous Primate,17,2,0,"October 30, 2017",Recommended,276.4,"This game is one of my favorites of all time now. The world is immersive and beautiful.  The battles are challenging yet rewarding.  I played through it on Tactician mode  out of the gate because I beat the first game on Tactician mode and figured I'd master this in no time too.  The difficulty was surprising at times.  But one thing that I really liked about the difficulty was that it didn't rely on RNG for everything.  There are a few RNG elements, but for the most part the fights are designed to be beaten by strategy and predicting what the enemies would do. The over arching story was pretty classic, but what made me really love it was the companion stories.  They were really interesting and I really loved them.  Some people on here have commented that the companions don't interact much, and while I would have loved for them to interact more than they did, I feel like their stories cross over a lot.  For example Sebille and the Red Prince's stories straight up merge near the end if you are playing with them both in the party. I would suggest taking Lohse in your party too, because her personal quest is one of the best. I know there are still some bugs, and those can be frustrating. I know it uses some classic tropes, but classic tropes are classic for a reason.  Sometimes when you try  to reinvent the wheel you end up making a block of rock. The game also does successfully reinvent the wheel at a few points. I played it all through tactician mode and felt it was a good difficulty considering I took the hardest option.  If you are playing a game on the hardest setting you should expect to have to fight some fights multiple times to master them, and it makes me so happy that I never felt like I was just flipping a coin to win a fight.  Every decision in fights matters a lot. It's not a perfect game, but no game has ever been perfect.  This game is pretty damn good though, and if they fixed the broken quests and bugs I would put it in my top 5 RPGs instantly.  My major complaint about this game is that there isn't more of it.  I can't wait for some DLC."
Atara Mos,174,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,147.3,"I had played the prior game and was encouraged to pick this game up in Beta because of the promise of having more than just one friend join you. In the Beta alone I have over 30 hours of play time, and we barely got out of the first area. That isn't a bad thing at all! That is a testament to the variety of ways that you can do things. We wanted to try all the different classes, the different racial traits, the different talents. The addition of a single talent can entirely change how the story plays out, which dramatically increases replayability. You're presented with multiple ways to resolve your quests, and each are different and can have influence on multiple aspects of your character. Despite the 30+ hours in beta I still found entirely new things in release.  The story is rich and deep because of how so much of your character influences different interactions and what you find along the way. The combat being turn based is a lot more thoughtful than just running up and bashing your strongest skill, you can truly use the environment to your advantage, or accidentally screw yourself over with it if you aren't careful.  It really harkens back to the classic rpgs of the past in such a great way.  My only real critique is that the learning curve is sort of steep to start, camera movement isn't the most intuitive and takes a bit to figure out the finessing of it, as the tutorial is minimal. This can lead to some funny interactions, though, as you figure out that maybe red outlined things aren't the best thing to click on with others around."
No Name Salted Butter,156,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,62.7,"Easily one of the best RPG's ever made.  To me it has a feel similar to the fable titles with the freedom you get (within reason) during a dungeon and dragons session.   The combat is tactical and challenging while also rewarding, the characters are interesting, the world is beautiful and fleshed out, and overall the game once it was fully released is polished and well worth the wait and money put into it.   The game master mode is also a welcomed addition, only adds to value of the game."

Seadragon 竜海 [JP],392,2,0,"October 15, 2017",Recommended,69.8,"Divinity Original Sin II is a true masterpiece...the best game of the year 2017. 10/10. Every aspect is of such high quality: the dialogue, the voice acting, the music, the excellent UI, the art style, the graphics, the amazing combat mechanics, the sense of exploration and adventure, the level design, the encounter design, the pacing... it's all super well done, way above what you normally get in an rpg.   There's such a large amount of things to find, places to explore, animals to talk to (If you have the required talent) and let’s not forget, towns filled with victims to pickpocket!   There are so many different classes you can have and you're not limited in any way, you could be a rogue necromancer or a tank archer if you wanted.   I'm 60+ hours in and it has not gotten tedious or started to feel formulaic or repetitive, which is something that I've never seen happen in a long single player game either.  The side stories, environments and things you do are varied enough to feel fresh after 60+ hours, the sense of exploration and adventure never goes away.   Every time you level up or progress further in the story you are rewarded with new spells and abilities that keep expanding on the combat and allowing you to experiment and try new builds and tactics, which keeps you from falling into familiar combat patterns/habits and keeps you entertained.   Watch on youtube some gameplay, buy the game. This is one game you won’t regret buying.  "
Dr. Nitrógeno,162,2,0,April 15,Recommended,71.3,"Very good game. I played the first one with my girlfriend and the co-op experience of two Lone Wolves was amazing, the second part is the same but with more content, nothing more.  Pros:  - Split Screen for PC - Very good Graphics - Unique storytelling and situations. - Best combat in a RPG so far (Sorry for the RTWP lovers) - Pet Pal Talent - Wells - Very good customization of characters, the magic mirror is amazing. - Very well optimized, the game runs smooth with a GTX770 in ultra, only few freezes in split screen.  Cons:   - ORIGINS, I don't like premade characters, if you choose lone wolf you skip a very big part of the game. - No Linux support. Seriously Larian? I needed to make a partition only to play the game. - Poor localization. I'm a native spanish speaker (I'm from Spain), for me english is not an issue but it is for my girlfriend...  Anyways, the game is one of the best RPG ever made, for me it's better than BG2 and Vampire: TMB.   Buy it if you can spend a lot of hours in one game, and be prepared for a tragic-humoristic situations, it worths the price."

As an example of the freedom provided, here is an example quest you would encounter: There is an <enemy> you were sent to kill because he stole the <quest giver's> <item> and you are to return said item to the quest giver:  - receive objective and start quest - straight up complete quest the way it was asked of you - OR talk to someone the ""right"" way and learn info that complicates things - OR find evidence through explorations that complicates/benefits/hinders things - OR depending on what character you chose in the beginning, <quest giver> or <enemy> might have history with you and attack/help/trust/not trust/give additional quest/etc - OR you had already stumbled upon that <enemy> and killed him already so you get the reward - OR you had already stumbled upon that <enemy> and he gave you a quest to kill the <quest giver> before the <quest giver> could talk to you - OR you decide to lie to <quest giver> and say you killed <enemy> but he didn't have the item just to get a half reward - OR persuade <enemy> to just give you the item back and leave town/apologize/fake his death/etc - OR you kill <enemy> and tell <quest giver> that <enemy> didn't have the item on him and you keep the item for yourself - OR you sneak up and pickpocket <enemy> and take <item> without killing him and return the <quest giver> and return <item> (and/or lie about killing <enemy>) - OR you kill/steal from <enemy>, return <item> to <quest giver>, recieve reward, THEN pickpocket <quest giver> and take the item back for yourself - OR tell the guards that <enemy> stole and the guards will kill him for you  - OR lure <enemy> near the guards, get <enemy> to attack you, and have the guards finish him - OR teleport <enemy> to <quest giver> with a power you learned and get them to fight it out themselves - etc etc etc  That's just the options with this one scenario. There are many more diverse quests that you can use your imagination + character skills + game mechanics to solve in a way that seems natural, inventive, beneficial, or just fun. This is expounded when you add in the Game Master mode that essentially lets you control every aspect of the game (map, story, dialogue, enemies, items, encounters, hidden secrets, etc etc) and even dnd aspects like die rolls for choices/actions to allow literally whatever solution you can imagine.  I haven't even touched the diversity of combat or skills or items or interactivity of the world or the many different paths you can take in the game, but there are plenty of other reviews that go in depth on those.   By far my favorite rpg and can't wait for any additions/sequels. "

There is real weight to this game, you can't help but be fascinated by this game world. It is a feeling I can only compare to that I had with Dark souls 3 recently.

Of all the RPG's I've played (Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, Witcher, KOTOR, Mass Effect, etc) this is the only game I can say has true and absolute freedom. The diversity and posibilities are endless making replayabilty not only valid but also incredibly unique and fun. The characters are fantastic and I am taken aback at how differently NPC's reacts to each one of your companions and your own created character depending on traits and race. With beautiful graphics, engaging lore, fantastic devs, a perfected co-op, and the ever-interesting world of Rivellon to explore I hope to see this game live on as legendary new standard for role playing games.   Also my low hours count is because I played the early access not on steam"

We played it coop with my girlfriend, trying to find & complete as many sidequests as we could and enjoyed it from start to end!  Yes, there are some little things that could be better, like every now and then a movement using a ladder would completely throw away the movement range that was visually given to us in the first place, but nothing that was really strong enough to prevent the overall great enjoyment of this excellent title.  Visually, narratively, gameplay-wise very pleasant. The only small mecanic we really didn't like was the way Persuasion works in dialogues.  PS: musics were ace too!"

Thy Nugget,75,2,0,February 7,Recommended,125.8,very good
Draceon,77,2,0,February 16,Recommended,22.3,"Story For those who love games like Skyrim, The Witcher, and Dragon Age, this game will be a welcome addition to your arsenal. It possesses background and history which I might in some cases call even better than any of the aforementioned games. Though much is left open to interpretation, the game does provide the player with a handfull of hints. and information. Its not so much that the story is more developed, after all Skyrim, The Witcher, and Dragon Age all have plenty of lore associated with them. However, Divinity has a better way of enticing the player to want to know more. The game isn't simply about finishing the main storyline, its more about the exploration of the world along the way. Your team will have certain skillsets, including a skill called loremaster which allows the player to learn about ancient, newly discovered artifacts. Each race has their own history and the relations between the races continue to devlop and become more known throughout the game. The game feels linear without feeling as though it limits the player, and I find this to be a great thing.  Controls and Perspective One ting that deterred me from playing more of this game earlier was the strange third person perspective, I am not personally used to this top down way of playing and pathfinding issues were sometimes a problem, though they were almost always solvable. It doesn't seem as engaging without the first person view, and in some ways seems more like a MOBA such as League of Legends in the way that the player sees the game. However, the game does allow the player to zoom in to see quite a lot more detail in the character models and the surroundings. It also uses some interesting post processing techniques to blur the backgrounds and have characters stand out when zooming in. However, its easy to get used to andn though perhaps not as immersive as Skyrim and The Witcher, it certainly has its benefits, particularly as pertaining to the combat system, which I will come to later.   Character Creation and Teams There are four races that can be played in the game, each have their skeletal variants which are also playable, these 4 species are dwarves, elves, humans, and lizards. Lizards are my personal favorite, I find them to look quite cool. However, who you pick and how you build them is completely up to you. Your decisions to upgrade certain skills, the race you choose, and the ability you decidie to learn all influence how the game progresses. Lorewise, Lizards are nobles and are often disliked because of their snobbish nature. Elves can eat flesh and learn about what that person was last doing, dwarves seem to be rather talkative, and humans are, well, boring. Because they're human. But while who you choose to play matters, you can still adopt team members from various different races and backgrounds and get their benefits. They can have all manner of classes and specializations. You can be a necromancer, reanimating the dead and using them for your advantage, sucking the life out of your enemies. You can cast air or fire spells to destroy your enemies. Or you can hit people with swords and arrows, definitely not as epic, but still quite important.  Combat System This combat system is one of the most unique, but challenging ones I've seen in a while. I thought turn based had to mean something along the lines of Civ V, but it really doesn't. Turn based combat really adds strategy to this game, you have to position your mages, rangers, assassins, and fighters correctly in order to be able to deal the most damage and keep your team alive. With such a diverse amount of spells and weapons, everything brings something new to the table. There is no undo button and making the wrong choices can lead to costly issues. However, a teammate dieing does not necessarily mean they are dead forever, a resurrection scroll can bring them back to life without too many issues. However, they do take some materials to craft or a lot of money to create.  Choices Matter Each dialogue, every upgrade, every step in combat seems to matter. When a player is given a choice, it is usually important for some reason. Thats part of what I love about this game so much, everything I do can lead to a different outcome. No game gives the player so many possibilities while still holding true to a definite storyline. However, your choices in skills start to matter less in the second act where you can just change your appearance and reallocate skill points. I like being able to change your appearance, but I don't think that reallocating skill points is the best idea. Though I have used it plenty, I feel like it takes away from some of the gravity that your choices have. It does however provide more freedom to change and evolve, which I can't argue with.  Crafting and Trading Yes, this game has crafting, and I'm not quite sure it was a good idea. One issue with this game in particular is that enemies don't respawn, so once you have cleared a camp and killed some enemies, they will never come back. You are essentially done with that zone. And this wouldn't be a problem considering how long it takes to finish the game and that there are so many places to visit, but it doesn't truly favor crafting. Though crafting is a good addition to almost any game, I don't find myself using it that much, the one time I have used it was for a quest. Considering how many items I get all the time from loot, it also doesn't really seem necessary to be crafting in this game. Would there be more opportunity to settle down and if this were more like a sandbox game, then the crafting system would make a lot more sense. I'm not saying this game shouldn't have one, I'm just saying that it doesn't really add to the experience like everything else does. When traidng with NPCs, you often get far less than an item is worth and the items you buy can cost 6-8 times as much. I know a lot of games charge these ridiculous in game prices with the in game currency and you can decrease cost with a skill, but I find this a bit excessive.   The Best Skill No doubt, the best skill is being able to talk with animals. It opens up new quests and oppprtunities, get it on at least one character, its called pet pal. I feel like this should come equipped by default with the main character as it is really important.  Summary All in all this is an absolutely wondeful game, with amazing graphics and intense storyline and lore. You're getting a fully fledged RPG on the level of other triple AAA titles. The player truly gets a sense of freedom whilst still being casually pushed in a direction. Each choice matters, each choice changes an outcome, and everything depends on the players playstyle and preference. Nothing in the story seems out of place, everything fits together, and the only limit to playing through this game is the willingness of those who wish to look deeper into the story. If you like a good/solid rpg game that isn't the standard shooter or hack and slash, then this is a game for you!"

This is my first CRPG and I was eased right in, the story is just the icing on the cake that is the combat.  Edit:  So after finishing this game I can undoubtedly say that this is one of my favorite games of all time. Not many games make you wanna start a new run again, specially those which are 100+ hrs long. That says quite a lot about this game. The replay value is amazing."

Horse with a Horn__,88,2,0,"November 19, 2017",Recommended,60.2,"Best game in a long time! Im playing Splitscreen with a friend of mine from couch using a steam controller. This works great!  I also played Divinity Original Sin 1 and als ready had a lot of fun there. Unfortunatly i never completed it, because i was missing a stone shard, that ive never found.  But i have to say THIS is way more casual than the first part. It is easier to get into, but still the quest are missing categorization to side or main quest and we got stuck some times (but way less than in Divinity 1).  Pros: + Splitscreen for 2 Players + can be fully played with only 2 characters using ""lonewolf"" ability. (2 Player 2 charaters is a good setup and the lonewolf makes it pretty easy in some parts of the game) + large worlds giving a lot of playtime and discovery. + all RPG elements are very well implemented (Looting and Leveling is as it shoudl be, most important and fun) + a lot of side storys and word telling, giving you a great feeling for the world youre playing in  Cons: - Some minor bugs. I got totally stuck one time! Make sure to save as often as you can - really annoying popup window, everytime i start. TO ALL WHO SAY THEIR GAME DOESNT WORK: it is probably this. The game tries to connect to some sort of service, which fails. Make sure to have .NET framework installed. Start the game, wait 2mins, try to start it again. then the popup should show. Click ""OK"" and the game shoudl start. - The quests are not obvious. It is always a problem to know what to do, in order to solve them, also a lot of quests interfer with each other, which leads to quests cannot be closed and so on. If you are stuck lookup the internet. I dont think its possible to completely fail the main quest though.   Conclusion: This is a great game and if you got a real life friend who also loves RPGs, grab 2 controllers and play, you will not regret it. I have not tried playing it Single Player."

ColdWolf,"1,027",2,0,"May 26, 2017",Recommended,238.9,"The single most detailed, challenging and fun cRPG I've ever played. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is not only a deep and meaningful game of tactics, exploration and puzzle solving, but also a master-class in dialogue and writing that shames Original Sin as if it were the work of a child in comparison.  Quests with meaningful choices and justifications, thought-out and deep skill combos that affect your playstyle and experience in combat, a surprisingly intriguing and not at all by-the-numbers story and absolutely NO handholding.  Everything that is great and wonderful about character driven RPGs is here and fleshed out,  I believe I've finally found the game that will let me retire from reinstalling Neverwinter Nights again for good. The only thing I wish they had done is let you roam the entire world like in Original Sin; the chapters are separate areas. They provide ample warning before you leave an area though, so it's not like it's a frustrating mechanic!  There have been complaints about the difficulty of not only the combat but also in solving the puzzles; If you're struggling to solve a puzzle it's because you haven't found all the clues; they're always there somewhere. if you can't beat a particular enemy because he's too strong you're gonna have to come back to him later. The game won't coddle you, you're supposed to learn how to defeat different enemy combinations through hard work and experimentation! The game is equal parts merciless and forgiving, enlightening and mystifying, challenging and fun.   A must-buy, and above all else; we must have a sequel, Larian!  The holiday is over, get back to work developer slaves!"

Dais Spires,41,2,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,51.8,"I love this game. I played the first one for a long time so I was already a fan, but this one is better then the first by far. I love the new class skills, the new races, and simplified crafting system. The game is appropriately difficult, and you will most likely have to do some battles more then once to figure it out. So save often. Build craft is so much fun in the game, and the replay value is very clear from the start. I keep wanting to make new characters just to try things differently. I love Love LOVE playing a Rouge. Teleporting, sneaking, stealing and back-stabbing. It's just the best.   The multiplayer in this game is a lot of fun too. I play with my husband for hours on our days off. We yell at eachother from other rooms to try and figure out a strategy, or when one of use screws up and kills the other. I feel like you wanna play this with someone you really like though, because the first time they accidentally stun you, and ruin your big attack you've been setting up, you'll wanna kill them. I am very glad this game is Co-op though. We need more games like this in the world.   So, get this game. You already want to, or else you wouldn't be here. Just do it. You won't regret it, and if you do, then there is something wrong with you. This game is amazing."

sexyb[A]boy,113,2,0,January 1,Recommended,281.5,What do you get when DnD is ported into the digital world? Answer: Divinity: Original Sin 2. The game capitalizes on turn-based combat and does it right. The world is vast and there are countless personalities and quests to encounter. I'm only around 12 hours in and I know this game is gonna take up most of my time for the coming months. If you enjoy captivating story-telling and nail-biting action then this title is for you.  Pros: 1. Amazing story-telling that is so good you have to listen to what this person/creature has to say 2. Interesting preset characters to choose from or interact with 3. Complex but understandable progression system 4. Various spells that can change the tide of battle 5. Dozens and dozens of items that all have their purpose 6. Stunning graphics that bring the game to life 7. The Narrator describes the scenarios and situation in great fashion 8. You can talk to pigs/squirrels/cats 9. You can talk to cats 10. I already love DnD  Cons: 1. Not enough races to choose from (IMO) 2. Heavy lore may not be appealing to newcomers 3. I killed a wounded soldier who was in the way only to find out his family was excited that he was coming back home (That cut deep)  10/10. GOTY worthy.

CosmoCorgi,35,2,0,"November 8, 2017",Recommended,68.2,"If you are a fan of turn-based combat and an RPG that allows creativity instead of limiting it; if you like a game with a decent story, but really are looking for deep game mechanics; if you are looking for an RPG that will allow you to have drop-in and drop-out co-op seamlessly; if you are into D&D and want to make your own D&D map.... THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.  I haven't completed the game yet, but from what I have seen it is definitely my new favorite game of all time. The amount of fun that I have with this game reminds me of when I first picked up Dragon Age Origins. You can create any type of character you want and even change it later if you aren't happen with your choices. The game doesn't really hold your hand, which is nice, and there are many ways to strategize a battle -- use your imagination! If you have a character that is sneaking around you can initiate combat with your other characters and have that sneaky character get into position before engaging.   The crafty is really tricky in the sense that it doesn't really help you. You can pick up books that give you recipes, but if you don't find any books you wont know how to make certain things. There are guides online to help in this regard, however. The amount of things you can craft is seemingly endless. Dozens of spells are craft only spells!  Try a playthrough by yourself to get your bearings, or jump into a game with a guide and have them show you the ropes. The game is best with friends, but it still enjoyable by yourself.  There are bugs, but it is to be expected. Updates are quick and the developer actually listens to the players.  8.5/10"

Downside is sort of strange fiction where clerics heal by sucking blood off the ground? Very detailed but still odd to me. Fun game.  I'm having an issue where I get jumped by badguys near the edge of town. I run into town and stand next to a town guard.  I stay in combat because exiting teleports you like fast travel. He is still out there watching me get beaten down in front of him while never ever attacking the guy burning EVERYTHING. (the fire does nothing to the guards and townsfolk not in combat yet hugging)  So there is that. Still a good game.  This is quickly turning into a feces title.  In sneak as a barrel tucked in a corner behind a tent BUT the guard detect vision goes through that type of object.   So much saving and loading because of lack of polish.  For instance just now; a fading mine that cloaks when your near.  -I saw it and manuver my man to a point where straight line in a safe corridor was the direct path. -I click the destination and my digidal dynamo heads off straight as an arrow like planned, only to vear 45* left straight into the mine blowing it and dodging a terrifying patch of THIN AIR!

Zealous,48,2,1,"November 8, 2017",Recommended,389.0,"Honestly, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a fun game. It has a solid story, good character design, and a plethora of items and quests. It kept me busy for a good couple weeks, and entertained me the whole time. The combat system is entertaining, if a bit challenging, and the world is large and fun to explore, packed with secrets and quests. There are so many choices when picking a character. In general, the game offers lots of choices, but there are so many character combinations it's almost hard to decide what you want to do, so you just make a few characters and play the game twice. It also has great modding community, and all it's other modes are solid as well. It does suffer from some issues though. The UI needs a bit of work, some areas are laggy, some hitboxes are confusing, and the journal sometimes doesn't provide enough information. It's not a perfect game. However, it is relatively new. GIve it time, and I guarantee, all these minor issues will be fixed. The only real issue I have with the game is the ending. You get your final battle and all, but in the end, all that happens is that you hear about what happened to everyone after the events of the game, and some of it sounds like fun, to be honest. All in all, this is a solid gaming experience and a must play for any fan of the RPG genre. It is worth the price."

ColdWolf,"1,027",2,0,"May 26, 2017",Recommended,238.9,"The single most detailed, challenging and fun cRPG I've ever played. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is not only a deep and meaningful game of tactics, exploration and puzzle solving, but also a master-class in dialogue and writing that shames Original Sin as if it were the work of a child in comparison.  Quests with meaningful choices and justifications, thought-out and deep skill combos that affect your playstyle and experience in combat, a surprisingly intriguing and not at all by-the-numbers story and absolutely NO handholding.  Everything that is great and wonderful about character driven RPGs is here and fleshed out,  I believe I've finally found the game that will let me retire from reinstalling Neverwinter Nights again for good. The only thing I wish they had done is let you roam the entire world like in Original Sin; the chapters are separate areas. They provide ample warning before you leave an area though, so it's not like it's a frustrating mechanic!  There have been complaints about the difficulty of not only the combat but also in solving the puzzles; If you're struggling to solve a puzzle it's because you haven't found all the clues; they're always there somewhere. if you can't beat a particular enemy because he's too strong you're gonna have to come back to him later. The game won't coddle you, you're supposed to learn how to defeat different enemy combinations through hard work and experimentation! The game is equal parts merciless and forgiving, enlightening and mystifying, challenging and fun.   A must-buy, and above all else; we must have a sequel, Larian!  The holiday is over, get back to work developer slaves!"

TheCynicalTaco,154,2,0,February 3,Recommended,237.1,"I've got to say that after 200 hours of experiencing this game and trying out different means of playing, I've encountered an experience like no other. It is obvious that the developers of this game have put in their hearts to making a game that best suits the wants of a community of tired gamers who just wanted the freedom to make decisions, to customize their gameplay, and have a fully immersive story all along the way. Not only that, but this game will introduce you to new and interesting game mechanics that are both a pleasure to play with and against. When things go wrong in the game, you can't help but laugh it off because you are fully aware that your faults lay in your own mistakes or lack of understanding about certain core mechanics. However frustrated you may get at something or upset with yourself for having made some mistake, the game is interesting and engaging enough to motivate you to try again and learn from your mistakes. This game is definitely a must buy for any rpg lover.  If there is one thing I can hope to see in the future, it is official DLC. I would love to experience new classes, new abilities, new gear, and new stories. It would be nice to have a playthrough of the ""enemy's"" side since even many of the enemies can be misunderstood or mislead. Also, a story revolving around the races that aren't present in this game could make for more gameplay and story without taking away from the existing one. Finally, more emphasis on the cooking/crafting system would be warranted. As it stands, crafting is not very important as you can find everything that is craftable and more. One of the only important recipes you need to know: Shoes + Nails = saved lives."

Owning Duck,73,2,0,"November 2, 2017",Recommended,364.0,"This game is now my most favorite game, I played DOS twice, one playthrough by myself (150 hours) and one with my friend (60 hours). I can say that I really enjoyed the first game and was really looking forward to DOS 2. I'm almost 200 hours into it and I am not even done with the campaign. But being nearly done I think I can give a proper review.  Combat: So most people criticize the game for being turn-based rather than a real-time with pause function. But it feels right in place as the combat still feels so engaging. The combat is tougher since a lot of skills that you have, the enemies have as well. This makes the combat harder but also more rewarding once you get past it. The game is hard yet fair. There are fights that seem impossible but the game provides us with the tools to win or hides the tools within the world. A lot of the skills feel strong and useful. But towards the end game, I find that magic damage started to be more obsolete as it is much faster and easier to physical as that it the most reliable way to damage. Though that might be because my team consisted of 3 physical dealers and one wizard.  Story: This is by far my favorite part of the game. The story is rather simple yet done in a way that makes it compelling. And as someone who played the other Divinity games, there are a lot of surprising plot twists that I was surprised by. But where the game shines the most is the origin stories. You can either create your own character or choose one of 6 pre-made origin characters that have their own backgrounds. And and these stories are very well-written with equally well made characters. It is so interesting to see how much the game changes because of who you are. If you didn't pick an origin character, you can still recruit them but after a certain point, they will become unavaible. It is a rather intersting thing of being a side character to the origin character's stories though. And each origin chracter will have a personal quest which will result in some drastic endings. But some advice, do not play as Lohse. Not because she is bad, she is a great character with a one of my favorite stories. But Lohse is best when played as a companion and her personal ending yields the best reward a video game has ever given.  UI: I will be blunt about it, it's bad. Inventory management is a nightmare. Sadly it is also required in powering up your weapons in the end game. You will spend a long time in your inventory looking through it to find a single item. Crafting can be done through a seperate menu but most of the time you will be combing random stuff together and that is horrible. In the end game, you will have so much clutter mostly involving books and paper with no swift and reliable way to dispose of them.   Other Notes: The game has quite alot of bugs as well. The first area will be rather polished because it was in early access for a long time. But the game is large and some parts are even broken at times. But I would like to say that I have not faced a bug bad enough to take away from my enjoyment. The game is best played (in my opinion) with a roll with it attitude. Just accept mistakes that happen. It is really fun to see all my mistakes bite me in the♥♥♥♥♥later down the line. And before I forget, the soundtrack. It is a masterpiece. DOS 2 has a different composer from the past Divinity games (RIP Kirill) but the new composer has truly put his heart and soul into it and it is an absolute joy to listen to.   Just buy the game. Larian deserves all of the praise and hopefully they will make a console version so we all can share in the masterpiece that is Divinity Original Sin."

Strategy is the key to complete this game. The game already begins at your character creation screen, where there are options like: Race, Talents, Abilities, Skills, Class etc. given to you. Everything you choose from here on will change the way you interact with the world. This makes this game so unbelievably huge. You can interact with literally everyone, you have the option to kill or spare one's life, there are multiple ways to complete a quest etc. But the most important thing of all: ""eveything you choose to do has its consequenses."" For instance, if you scold a character he will not like you therefore he won't trade with you no more. Or if you kill a character, you won't be able to finish a questline. Or you found a strange animal somewhere across the map which gained your liking and therefore he want to accompany you.   This game is exactly what a RPG should be.

pinkpinnn,248,2,0,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,122.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 - 2017 GEM.  Finding a game that mixes RPG, D&D, customizable class/ characters, good story telling, beautiful aesthetics, crafting system, tactical turn based battle, and option to play co-op? This game pretty much offers it all up on a silver plate.  I've played the first Divinity Original Sin, and my impression of that wasn't so strong, however I decided to give this a try, and it definitely floored me.  None too many games I've played have done a swell job in buffing lores, stories, and open ended quests for you to explore. You don't have to be a lore-lover or a rouge type gamer to enjoy this. There's a sweet spot for everyone. I went looking for a plain old adventure-with-consequences game, and spent more time reading up short lores here and there instead of speeding through it.  I can't believe I've spent 80+ hours (solo play) and still haven't completed it yet. Actually for the first chapter, I managed to spend 8-9 hours (and this was just purely exploring and figuring out quests). Halfway through the game, it even conjured up my nostalgia for Dragon Age 1.   CONS/ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  -Sometimes there are NO warnings before huge consequences take place. And when it happens, it's too late to alter (unless you are bothered to load up a game save 1 hour ago+). This happened a few times for me, the most painful one for me being: I couldn't take my companions to the next chapter because I'd missed that one window to convince them. They were absolutely gone. I loaded a previous save, but ever since that happened, I ended up tracking quests on wikia instead in fear of a major slip up -Quest journals are sometimes vague, and you will be left wondering or wiki-ing what the next step should be -Some quests feel un-finished or un-polished, as there may only be ONE, OBSCURE way of completing it -Not a must, but nice to have: Camera angle needs more rotation flexibility -No option to hide the HUD  PROS:  -The battle system constantly makes you look for the best spots to prepare and engage. Whenever you think you've got your ""go-to"" strategies nailed down, the game manages to switch it up just a little to make it challenging (+fun) again -Attention to detail towards the environment and the overall atmosphere. I don't always stop and look at the shadows of leaves and trees in a game. Each chapter is a map with it's own characteristics -Memorable background sound and music <3 Well done Borislav Slavov  -EVERY character has a voice! And voice acting is just ace -Main companions have decent back stories, although 1 or 2 still seem like pompous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s after 20 hours -HIGH replayability value -Co-op offers extra fun if you want play with you rmates, and most things work smoothly. Just take note of the connectivity menu, and make sure to set your game privacy, as random people can enter your game and hijack your acharacter completely. -Dungeon master mode! For those who are into D&D this might be an interesting mode to check out  TO THINK THIS GAME WAS BACKED BY A KICK STARTER AND DEVELOPED + LAUNCHED UNDER 3 YEARS!  It's not easy balancing and taking in multiple opinions and ideas and delivering on something this decent. I suspect good team work somewhere in Larian Studios. The game is decent enough for me to overlook the annoying flaws (for now). And major game developing companies? You guys better brush up your A game. Top notch graphics aren't the only thing that makes a game immersive and great.  ANYWAYS...JUST...Just ..go play it!"
Sandwich Boy,400,2,0,March 13,Recommended,27.6,"This is one of the most immersive games I've played in years.  The graphics are great for a CRPG, the story is engrossing, and every line of dialogue is fully voiced.  There is so much depth in every aspect of the game.  The character customization, crafting system, and combat are some of the best I've seen in any game, let alone any CRPG.  Combat encounters are difficult without feeling unfair.  Others may feel differently, but as a casual player, I found the ""classic"" difficulty setting to be just about perfect.  Combat is turn-based, but it is sort of a mix between tactical turn-based combat, and the classic RTS-Style combat of games such as Baldur's Gate. Players are definitely rewarded for being creative in combat, so simply running the party headlong into an encounter isn't always the best strategy.  The Divinity world has some interesting twists on the generic fantasy setting.  Each quest and side quest feels unique, and characters (even minor characters), are interesting and realistic.  This game also has some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in an rpg, which is crazy, given how much dialogue there is.  The attention to detail is absolutely amazing, resulting in tons of secrets to uncover in the world, as well as complex interactions between items, characters, etc.  Here's a fun example: When a character is wounded in (or out) of combat, blood can splatter onto the ground.  This blood can be frozen, resulting in a slippery patch of ice on the ground, or struck with a bolt of lightning, shocking anyone who is touching the puddle.  The blood could also be absorbed for health by a necromancer.  Somehow the game doesn't feel like it has a steep learning curve, despite all of this richness and complexity.  There's a lot more to say, but I'll keep this review short.  If you have any interest in CRPGs, or RPGs in general, you should check this game out."

Mokona,31,2,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,22.7,"This review is just based on my first impressions of the game. Its worth getting.  There is an insane amount of skills and combos you can do that a single play through will never allow you to see all the cool stuff you can do so the replay value is high. My favorite thing I've discovered in the game is the way recruiting followers works. First you must convince them to follow you to begin with, they dont just come along because you are the ""chosen one"" or some crap. To boot if you like a character you dont have to worry about him being a mage when you are already a mage because each character asks you what you want them to be. No longer are you forced to not take your favorite npc with you or forced to play a class you dont like just to take it with you. You can finally have a balanced party full of npc you find interesting hurrah.  The only thing I would ""complain"" about is the lack of non human races. You got human, dwarf (small human), elf (vegetarian human), and lizard man (finally its not a human). Skeleton variations of all is nice to throw in but I honestly am just done with every fantacy game haveing there races be the 3 over used races, human, elf, dwarf, and then a final race being there own ""custom"" race that just turn out to be another human but blue or something like that. Glad we got lizard men but wish we had a few more.  This game has a lot of thought put into it and it somehow didn't lauch at the $60 price point, with mod support. I expected this to be as dissapointing as pillars of eternity was but just jumping into the character creation and I was already loving the game."
Chris (CHA),219,2,0,"December 2, 2017",Recommended,44.3,"Let's keep this short: This is one of the best RPGs around.  Tons of fun alone, and even more fun with the right party.

Ardis,193,2,0,"December 5, 2017",Recommended,200.8,"After playing dozens of hours with my buds across a few different timezones I can honestly say that this game has brought us fun and memories few others have. The combat is engrossing, satisfying, and keeps you talking. You are encourged to work together and experiment, and the massive freedom of choice in the game means you'll never know what someone is going to get your party into. However, that same freedom can also mean that you aren't always clear on the ""right"" way to go, so you might spend some time exploring or consulting guides. You can always make your own path if you want to though.   There were a few odd bugs. One of my friends was having issues with his inventory just dissapearing. Reloads didn't fix it and he was unable to use any items. During combat, things aren't always crystal clear on what you can hit and what is in range, so sometimes you just have to wing it. It usually works out though. Not many complaints from me on this one, it'll go down as one of my fondest multiplayer experiences ever. Thanks to the devs for giving me great times with my friends."

If you take your time and familiarize yourself with the concepts and systems of this game, you will enjoy one of the most engrossing, enjoyable, well written, and enjoyable RPG's ever. The combat let's you get creative and do just about anything in a variety of ways.

The core mechanics are polished and innovative, the writing is brilliant, the music is phenomenal, the setting is engaging and the care and detail put into letting the player play the damn game - the way that they want to - takes center stage.  But you know this. Everyone knows this.  I want to talk about what a bunch of badasses work at Larian Studios. The sheer amount of work these people put into everything is immediately obvious from even the most cursory of glances, but you have to respect the business practices as well. Seriously. Larian runs a studio like a... Like a... Like a bunch of hardworking enthusiasts who respect their players.  Crazy, right?  At this point I would say ""compare that to a company like EA"", but that would be pointless. There isn't a comparison to be made. Free release of the Enhanced Edition for the first game, using Steam early access responsibly for the second, and releasing the entire game engine for you to learn and build your own content with? Larian continues to knock it out of the park to the point that I feel totally justified in gushing in the review session for them. I ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE these people, buy the game, you'll see why."

I've also not made it past Fort Joy (the beginning right after the tutorial) yet as ive repeatedly restarted, playing around with different builds and such. But i am having a fantastic time with it. i havent enjoyed an RPG so much since Dragon Age Origins, nor have i wanted to smash my screen so much since initially discovering the Dark Souls games. I havent really played the first even though i own it so im not sure how it compares but i just might have to go play though it after this one.  Thank God for autosave, whether it be trying to survive an underground fight club at level 2-3 or dying to teleporting crocodiles, it has come in handy many times already.  I cant comment on the storyline so much yet as i havent really gotten into it yet but the origin stories seem interesting and custimization (even for origin characters) is fantastic.   In short if you enjoy RPG's and dont want to button smash your way to victory but actually use some strategy than this game is for you. You get a real feeling of accomplishment when you finally beat those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ teleporting crocodiles after 30-45 mins and 5-6 reloads.  Oh and graphics/optimization seem to be pretty great too, am running on max settings with no lag nor have come across any bugs as of yet although i still have a ways to go obviously.

Far better than any other games I've played.  You get to know each character of your group and every actions you make WILL impact future quests.  I could talk hours and hours about that magnificient game, but I don't have time for that. I'd rather play this over and over and over again.  The Soundtrack is amazing, and after playing 80hrs, listening to any song brings nostalgia. Each time I log back on this game, I wish I havn't played it already to revive this awesome story.  If you play the game like it should be played and you actually care for the dialogs, which are f**cking awesome btw, there's between 60/80 hours of play time ahead.  11/10. Thanks for making this game. I hope there's another one upcoming."
Luis,"2,122",2,0,"October 15, 2017",Recommended,240.2,"Absolutely incredible.  Basically feels like going from Baldur's Gate 1 to 2 (though not quite, since that was continuing from low level to midrange and then to epic levels with the same narrative, and this is not that), since the new armor system involves you either taking advantage or PEELING off layers of armor before you can actually do things.  Positioning and elemental manipulation are somehow even more important this time around. Fortunately, a lot of the difficult encounters are not initiated until you finish a dialog, so one has plenty of time to position  the party as one sees fit.  The original one was an amazing game that I spent hundreds of hours on, but never actually finished. This so far  is shaping up to be an even more impressive experience that I will revisit over and over.   That being said, it is slightly disappointing that the premade dwarf character has extremely little relevance to the plot until the 4th act, and then it is tangential. Oh well."

There are few good game studios left out there, ones that really seem to love what they do and seem to be happy as long as they make money, not trying to squeeze every damn cent they can out of their fans, and more and more game studios seem to go this route, luckally we have some great studios that resist like CDPR and Larian, I try my best to not fall into brand loyalty and all that crap, but Larian really deserves it.

Additionally, as a separate download, the devs made the tools that they used ot make the main campaign available for us to use.   As the game ages and people have time, I'm sure we will see some epic user-made campagins.

Hitch,25,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,102.8,"I purchased, but didn't log a ton of hours in the remastered first iteration of this game (36 hrs), but this 2nd one just feels right, and it's a homerun for Larian. I will start by saying I have only experienced the co-op of this game, which so far has been a load of fun to play with a good friend:   Areas to highlight:  The story telling is vastly improved, with exceptional voice dialogue (gaming industry wise). There are a ridiuclous amount of options for dialogue depending on your characters skills and tags. Rich orchestra sounds bring you back to some of your favorite RPGs of old. The game is gorgeous too, graphics are superb. Scenes are incredibly detailed, from brightly lit beach environments to dark, dreary dungeons. The mood is dark and sombre overall but clever writing adds in humor all along the way. HUD is intuitive and nothing new, co-op shared backpack screen is something to behold; very convenient. The combat is intuitive but high on difficulty, Larian does not hold your hand in this one. There are major things in the game that are not obvious which I won't spoil, and without the internet you'd miss a lot. Highly recommend playing without reading up on the game, it makes for a much better/realer experience. Those new to this type of game will repeat battles many times over on the harder difficulties. This is Turn-Based though, at it's best. Re-trying is half the fun, learning from your previous mistakes becomes essential. Winning a battle on the first go after using perfect tactics really feels satisfying.  Areas for Improvement:  We encountered minor bugs, a learned spell that wouldn't show up in the mage book, finishing a successful dialogue with a creature then clicking them again by accident only to have new dialogue that leads to a fight. Stuff that requires a reload but isn't game breaking, and occurs infrequently. The environment manipulation is incredible, and no other game has allowed players to control fights so well using it, however it becomes a bit too much at times with the blood, water and other puddles--often making magic-type characters useless since every attack hurts your friends and foes alike. Source spells are a great idea but would be nice to be able to use once per battle or game day. Current game makes it hard to accumulate source points for skills that truthfully really arent as impressively OP as they should be at that rarity. Lastly, the gold/bartering system needs a hotfix bad. You need to move a slider to hit exact gold value on both sides, without an option to go up by 1 or type in a value. This is a basic that has been overlooked.   Summary:  I look forward to logging many more hours before updating this review (so far at around 30 hrs). Recommended for anyone who loves old-school (or new) cRPGs or any 1-4 group of friends looking for a great game to co-op, just note it requires much focus, dialogue/reading and chatting, so I wouldn't recommend playing with a stranger. Also be prepared for 4 hr+ play times. It is almost impossible to make any progress in 1-2 hr playings. Congrats to Larian on a job well done, it's been one of the better RPG games I have played in years.  I would score D:OS2 9/10."

I don't know if resemblance was intentional but I can't help but think of a few games that this game reminds me of however, often I don't hold it to that and because I just want to play Diviniy II, as Divinity II. I wont describe it (being the games it resembles and the game itself) because I feel that takes away from the spectacular creation that is Divinity Original Sin II, after all. the creators have no doubt been influenced, but in the best ways ever possible.  They took glorious ancient concepts and with a few unique features I've only see them do, and make it all their own. Plus it is a game you will have enjoyed 10 to 100 if not 1000 times more if you just go in. Maybe watch the first steam video like I did, but that's all I did and as a result I find something amazing.  This is... the best game I have played in over a decade.   And by the time I'm done with it. Which will be awhile- I am looking forward to say, it is the best game, I have played, ever. I will edit my review then, and untill then-  I just have to give it a thumbs up.  10/10"
Canspo,201,2,3,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,124.7,"I love this game, but it terrifies me the amount of time I can play it without stopping.  Just the other day I started playing at 7pm and after what seemed like a few hours I looked down at my hands and noticed that they were considerably more wrinkled than before. I looked in a mirror and saw that I'd aged 60 years, my jowls sagged, leathery eyelids hung heavy over my now grey faded eyes. I looked outside and saw the changed world. The people wore such strange clothing, some wore suits of purple fur with their faces painted into crude animal caricatures, other people wore shoes on their hands and gloves on their feet, but nothing else. The world had changed so much, how long had I been playing Divinity? A single tear rolled down my cheek as flying automobiles whiz by my window.  Anyway the point is this game is fantastic and addictive"

I usually don't like turn-based combat, but man do they make it fun here; So much thought goes into every move you make.  You have to outsmart your enemies (fantastic AI btw) by using the environment/elements to your advantage.  Honestly, if you like RPG's, this is a must-buy.  I really can't recommend this one enough."

CosmoCorgi,35,2,0,"November 8, 2017",Recommended,68.2,"If you are a fan of turn-based combat and an RPG that allows creativity instead of limiting it; if you like a game with a decent story, but really are looking for deep game mechanics; if you are looking for an RPG that will allow you to have drop-in and drop-out co-op seamlessly; if you are into D&D and want to make your own D&D map.... THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.  I haven't completed the game yet, but from what I have seen it is definitely my new favorite game of all time. The amount of fun that I have with this game reminds me of when I first picked up Dragon Age Origins. You can create any type of character you want and even change it later if you aren't happen with your choices. The game doesn't really hold your hand, which is nice, and there are many ways to strategize a battle -- use your imagination! If you have a character that is sneaking around you can initiate combat with your other characters and have that sneaky character get into position before engaging.   The crafty is really tricky in the sense that it doesn't really help you. You can pick up books that give you recipes, but if you don't find any books you wont know how to make certain things. There are guides online to help in this regard, however. The amount of things you can craft is seemingly endless. Dozens of spells are craft only spells!  Try a playthrough by yourself to get your bearings, or jump into a game with a guide and have them show you the ropes. The game is best with friends, but it still enjoyable by yourself.  There are bugs, but it is to be expected. Updates are quick and the developer actually listens to the players.  8.5/10"

I've picked it up and can't put it back down; a experience I haven't had in years, especially when the game market is full of cheap cop outs. The base game has tons of hours of content, and gives you everything you need to make your own stories-- that is, the gamemaster mode is comprehensive and amazing.  If I had to make a comparison... I'd say it's like Coop skyrim but with much more depth and content. In any case, I strongly recommend this game, especially if you have a group of friends you like to play with regularly."

Geerterig,314,2,1,"October 11, 2017",Recommended,126.9,"Lemme tell you a story I experienced.  Arrive in a coastal town, pretty calm some magisters here and there. I enter the bar, and there's a guy offering me something. I find out it's hot steamy lizard sex, so, ofcourse, I pay him and go upstairs to the lizard lady. We have a very interesting night. But as soon as I wake up, I find that all my stuff is stolen. There's 5 guys in my room that I don't know. Suprised I ask the lizard lady what's going on, she says she's sorry, but this is a setup.  I get angry, you can't fool me, you can't set me up! Naked and without any weapons I attack the robbers, and I kill them all, taking the weapons of their body to finish of the rest, and using my magic to dish out even more damage. In the end, they all drop dead and I'm victorious. I talk to the lizard lady to ask what just happened, she admits they tried to rob me. The smooth-talker I am decide to forgive her, and say it was worth it for the night I had. She liked what I said, I continue talking to her, we end up having another sexy night. Me covered in blood and my enemies dead on the floor.   10/10, most fun I've ever had in an RPG. Definitely worth the purchase."

Piett,145,2,0,"November 26, 2017",Recommended,75.3,"I'm playing this multiplayer with my friends and it is really way more fun than it should be. Combat misadventures to follow, but the story interaction that you can have is fantastic. If one player starts talking to an NPC you can listen to the whole exchange as well, complete with the voice acted NPC dialog. You can see where your friend's cursor is as they debate what dialog choice they want to reply with- we always end up talking about which one fits our ""attitude"" the most, which is fun in and of itself. You are never standing around while someone has an awesome dialog with ""their"" quest NPC while you do nothing; you can always listen in and hear the story.  Now on to the combat. The combat is really well done, especially the environmental variables and conditions. For instance, the classic Divinity situation of use lightning or cold on someone standing in water or wet and they will be stunned or frozen respectively is great for planning out how you are going to take on a group of enemies. Until someone in your group makes it rain on the battlefield and then uses chain lightning. Now, in addition to your foe being stunned, your allies are as well. I am not saying that I have been stunned or frozen a few times, but I have been stunned or frozen a few times.  Lots of quests and side quests and NPCs to do tasks for, and lots of different ways of completing the tasks as well. We are still in our first play-through but already planning out classes for our second. One of the short comings is related to the quests, specifically the quest log. It can be difficult to discern if a quest is active only because you did a part of it out of order, such as visiting an NPC before you should have, or if you have not done the criteria of the quest. It is not game braking but it is a little bit out of place due to how good the rest of the game is, UI included."
DuckVader,135,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,116.0,"After quite some time I am getting the Dragon Age Origins rpg feel from any game, the 1st game was very good, but this feels great. I have not went too deep into the game yet but it already feels great, and after full voice acting support I think they aced it pretty much. I like how open-ended the game has been so far.  Great Race-Class system Fully Voice Acted  Playable Undead Race Great Music Great Combat System (specially if you are into turn based combat)  Downside so far for me is the running around I have to do to get back a party member once I let go of them. I think once they join your party and you ask them to leave they all should wait at a specific location not back to where you found them.  If you loved Dragon Age Origins and also loved X-COM then this game is provides the fun of both worlds in my opinion.  9/10 for me."

Hitch,25,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,102.8,"I purchased, but didn't log a ton of hours in the remastered first iteration of this game (36 hrs), but this 2nd one just feels right, and it's a homerun for Larian. I will start by saying I have only experienced the co-op of this game, which so far has been a load of fun to play with a good friend:   Areas to highlight:  The story telling is vastly improved, with exceptional voice dialogue (gaming industry wise). There are a ridiuclous amount of options for dialogue depending on your characters skills and tags. Rich orchestra sounds bring you back to some of your favorite RPGs of old. The game is gorgeous too, graphics are superb. Scenes are incredibly detailed, from brightly lit beach environments to dark, dreary dungeons. The mood is dark and sombre overall but clever writing adds in humor all along the way. HUD is intuitive and nothing new, co-op shared backpack screen is something to behold; very convenient. The combat is intuitive but high on difficulty, Larian does not hold your hand in this one. There are major things in the game that are not obvious which I won't spoil, and without the internet you'd miss a lot. Highly recommend playing without reading up on the game, it makes for a much better/realer experience. Those new to this type of game will repeat battles many times over on the harder difficulties. This is Turn-Based though, at it's best. Re-trying is half the fun, learning from your previous mistakes becomes essential. Winning a battle on the first go after using perfect tactics really feels satisfying.  Areas for Improvement:  We encountered minor bugs, a learned spell that wouldn't show up in the mage book, finishing a successful dialogue with a creature then clicking them again by accident only to have new dialogue that leads to a fight. Stuff that requires a reload but isn't game breaking, and occurs infrequently. The environment manipulation is incredible, and no other game has allowed players to control fights so well using it, however it becomes a bit too much at times with the blood, water and other puddles--often making magic-type characters useless since every attack hurts your friends and foes alike. Source spells are a great idea but would be nice to be able to use once per battle or game day. Current game makes it hard to accumulate source points for skills that truthfully really arent as impressively OP as they should be at that rarity. Lastly, the gold/bartering system needs a hotfix bad. You need to move a slider to hit exact gold value on both sides, without an option to go up by 1 or type in a value. This is a basic that has been overlooked.   Summary:  I look forward to logging many more hours before updating this review (so far at around 30 hrs). Recommended for anyone who loves old-school (or new) cRPGs or any 1-4 group of friends looking for a great game to co-op, just note it requires much focus, dialogue/reading and chatting, so I wouldn't recommend playing with a stranger. Also be prepared for 4 hr+ play times. It is almost impossible to make any progress in 1-2 hr playings. Congrats to Larian on a job well done, it's been one of the better RPG games I have played in years.  I would score D:OS2 9/10."

Dragona,215,2,0,January 11,Recommended,231.8,"Overall, I really enjoyed this game. I loved the interaction with my companions and helping them with their personal quests. The main story was enjoyable but felt really rushed towards the end. I felt the final part of the game was a bit rushed in general. For example, I expected more from Arx. It felt small for a city (it didn't even have an inn!) and had a lot of wasted potentials which could have included more quests, storylines and more companion interaction. I loved the romance options in the game too as it felt more immersive but from Arx onwards, it seemed a bit lacklustre and the epilogue at the end was a bit of a let down as it felt as if any romance was dismissed to have a 'one-size fits all ending'. Also, I'm sure I'm not the only one who found Sebille very buggy regarding romance if you had her in your party but were not romancing her. She would seem to force kisses on you even if you were just being nice but still turning down her advances. Other than these grievances, I really enjoyed the game as I found combat to be very fun and at times, challenging. I completed it on classic difficulty so I'm hoping tactician will be challenging to progress. I also loved being able to build my character in any way I choose. My custom character ended up with a support/summoner/caster hybrid which was a lot of fun to play. I've also played some co-op which most ends up being hilarious with friends which usually ends up with us all being on a murder spree around Fort Joy due to one person's inability to steal successfully.  If I were to summarise: +Enjoyable story +Great companion interaction (wish there was more of it towards the end!) +Romance is great for adding a new dynamic to your companions. +Great combat +Great character customisation regarding class builds etc  -A lot of bugs that are immersion breaking or require a reload. -Feels rushed in the final act -No mention of the romance you created in the final epilogue  I would love to see a further expansion to this game, for example, being able to go to the desert areas that Prince or Ifan are originally from but understand that the multiple endings would make this difficult.

Mokona,31,2,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,22.7,"This review is just based on my first impressions of the game. Its worth getting.  There is an insane amount of skills and combos you can do that a single play through will never allow you to see all the cool stuff you can do so the replay value is high. My favorite thing I've discovered in the game is the way recruiting followers works. First you must convince them to follow you to begin with, they dont just come along because you are the ""chosen one"" or some crap. To boot if you like a character you dont have to worry about him being a mage when you are already a mage because each character asks you what you want them to be. No longer are you forced to not take your favorite npc with you or forced to play a class you dont like just to take it with you. You can finally have a balanced party full of npc you find interesting hurrah.  The only thing I would ""complain"" about is the lack of non human races. You got human, dwarf (small human), elf (vegetarian human), and lizard man (finally its not a human). Skeleton variations of all is nice to throw in but I honestly am just done with every fantacy game haveing there races be the 3 over used races, human, elf, dwarf, and then a final race being there own ""custom"" race that just turn out to be another human but blue or something like that. Glad we got lizard men but wish we had a few more.  This game has a lot of thought put into it and it somehow didn't lauch at the $60 price point, with mod support. I expected this to be as dissapointing as pillars of eternity was but just jumping into the character creation and I was already loving the game."

The combat is intuitive but high on difficulty, Larian does not hold your hand in this one. There are major things in the game that are not obvious which I won't spoil, and without the internet you'd miss a lot. Highly recommend playing without reading up on the game, it makes for a much better/realer experience. Those new to this type of game will repeat battles many times over on the harder difficulties. This is Turn-Based though, at it's best. Re-trying is half the fun, learning from your previous mistakes becomes essential. Winning a battle on the first go after using perfect tactics really feels satisfying.  Areas for Improvement:  We encountered minor bugs, a learned spell that wouldn't show up in the mage book, finishing a successful dialogue with a creature then clicking them again by accident only to have new dialogue that leads to a fight. Stuff that requires a reload but isn't game breaking, and occurs infrequently. The environment manipulation is incredible, and no other game has allowed players to control fights so well using it, however it becomes a bit too much at times with the blood, water and other puddles--often making magic-type characters useless since every attack hurts your friends and foes alike. Source spells are a great idea but would be nice to be able to use once per battle or game day. Current game makes it hard to accumulate source points for skills that truthfully really arent as impressively OP as they should be at that rarity. Lastly, the gold/bartering system needs a hotfix bad. You need to move a slider to hit exact gold value on both sides, without an option to go up by 1 or type in a value. This is a basic that has been overlooked.   Summary:  I look forward to logging many more hours before updating this review (so far at around 30 hrs). Recommended for anyone who loves old-school (or new) cRPGs or any 1-4 group of friends looking for a great game to co-op, just note it requires much focus, dialogue/reading and chatting, so I wouldn't recommend playing with a stranger. Also be prepared for 4 hr+ play times. It is almost impossible to make any progress in 1-2 hr playings. Congrats to Larian on a job well done, it's been one of the better RPG games I have played in years.  I would score D:OS2 9/10."

wally,143,2,0,January 17,Recommended,147.0,"This game is a veritable masterpiece, and I would wager the best game I have ever played. The sheer freedom you are offered and the extreme creative solutions you can use to figure out any and every puzzle, battle or even little distractions, is alone enough to make this purchase well worth it. But Larian Studios went above and beyond fully voice acting all 75k lines of dialogue. The game offers a unique take on combat, heavily focusing on the environment around you and how to use it to your advantage in combat, constantly fighting for highground, throwing barrels, or laying down sheets of slippery ice in order to barely claw through the fight. The combat offers insane depth and even offers an arena mode in which you can duel other players with custom parties. The story experience also offers a full drop in/drop out 4-player experience. Every player is free to do what they want and at times this can lead to conflicting goals and fighting between what the party will do.   Even with all of this to offer, Larian went even further and added a GM mode, which allows users to create custom campaigns and a game master to guide the groups adventure. This also comes with full steam workshop support, allowing you to mod the game as you wish.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is, I think, the best game ever created and I suggest that you purchase this work of art as soon as you are able."

Captain K'nuckles,449,2,0,"September 2, 2017",Recommended,68.6,"Every once in a while, I get this unscratchable itch to play an RPG that allows for the freedom to not only get lost in the world and lore set before me, but to also interact and complete quests in a very open ended manner, create really unique characters with their own unique stories and ideals, and even have an actual sense of tabletop-esq role play while playing both solo and multiplayer. I've always wanted to be able to (for example) choose between either fighting a group of guards, stealth and skullduggery to sneak my way in, cause a major distraction and simply walk in, or whatever else possibility is necessary to achieve my goals of breaking into the captian's office to obtain incriminating documents.  Then along comes Divinity: Original Sin 2. A massive step up from D:OS1, (An already legendary CRPG) in just about every single major category. This EA is a very old build of what the final game will be if you've been keeping up with the Larian Dev Vids on YouTube and it still doesn't fail to astound me and scratch that itch.  We still have GM Mode to look forward to, and full mod support, and the fully unlocked campaign!   TLDR;  10/10"

Allanon,58,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,305.7,"I spent 99% of the time dicking around exploring the map.  In many other games I wouldn't have had a great time doing that because the map would end or there wouldn't be anything particularly interesting to find.  In say, Skyrim, there would probably be a cave with generic enemies to kill and that would be all.  In this game though, there was always something utterly magical to find.  I helped a rat and a turtle living in a cellar find love.  I talked to and killed evil scarecrows and helped a succubus escape a twisted hellscape with her lover.  I broke into the cellar of a kindly old woman who offered me a loan after her cat told me there were suspicious types down there and found debt collectors who turned into demons when approached.  Yet the most magical thing of all is how natural and meaningful it felt.  As a I naturally progressed through the game's story, I ran into so many bits that rewarded this idle and almost obsessive exploration.  Indeed, the story is so wonderfully open ended at times giving such simple yet broad goals that the only correct thing you can do at times is explore and lose yourself in this magical world that Larian has made.    Despite the broad nature of most of your goals the story still manages to remain present and intelligent.  Oftentimes it will surprise you by popping up at the most unexpected moments with new twists and turns in the most natural of fashions leading up to a conclusion that is both epic and satisfying.  At the beginning, your goal is simple: escape Fort Joy.  The game gives you little to no guidance on how you might do that yet you'll never feel at a lost since you'll discover so many possible ways to escape just by naturally exploring your environment.    This is easily the best game I have ever played.  There is so much magic, so much attention to detail, and a utterly brilliant and punishing battle system to boot.  It will be a long, long time before a game ever comes close to how good this game is."
Zely,93,2,0,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,371.8,I usually only stick to MMORPGs but I didn't regret this purchase for a second. The only RPG where I felt like I made choices (besides picking a class) that actually impacted the game.
Kiksu,287,2,0,"November 27, 2017",Recommended,105.5,"I took a bit of a punt on this game. I hadn’t played the original and I’ve never really had much of an interest in Baldur’s Gate style RPGs. But a couple of friends were really enjoying it and I was suffering from PUBG fatigue so I went ahead and bought it a few weeks after its release.  I’m really glad I did!  The first thing I liked was that it doesn’t require you to have played the first game to understand what is going on. It doesn’t assume knowledge of characters, events or setting. Everything comes at you in the context of the world you are in.  The RPG elements are easy to get to grips with. There are a massive number of skills to learn and I found that my party almost organically grew into distinct classes. I ended up with a warrior, a ranger, a wizard and an assassin. But I never felt like I was limited to a class because of the choices I’d made. I started to give my warrior some magical skills mid-way through my current playthrough and it works. Weapon and armour stats are simple too. The bigger the numbers, the better the item. I like that simplicity. That's not to say there is no depth.  You'll often need to compromise between armours physical strength defence and magical strength defence for example.  And a weapon may give you buffs and skills that the high level shiny sword you've just looted does not.  The world is massive. At the time of writing I’ve put in about 80 hours and I think I’m a little over half way through the game. At times the game can be a little intimidating. On arriving in a new area you can find yourself picking up quest after quest after quest. That many of these quests are not signposted on your map means you’re going to have to read the description to figure out where to go and what to do. I have quite a short attention span and so having to force myself to pay attention to the details and to keep referring to my log book was an interesting challenge that, somewhat surprisingly, I found I liked a lot.  The turn based combat reminds me a lot of the first two Fallout games, right down to the number of moves you can make being displayed as circular ‘pips’. Fights are genuinely thrilling encounters where tactics will play a huge part in your winning (or losing) a battle. High ground confers a damage bonus.  Different spells will interact with one another to produce (often unwanted) side effects. I’ve found myself having to sacrifice party members in a fight for a strategic advantage. The same fight might play out in different ways depending on how you approach it. Some fights can be avoided altogether if you’re a quick talker!  The biggest problem I have with the game is almost a contradiction of what I like about the game. It encourages you to explore. Very little is laid out for you. You need to learn the games mechanics and your path through its world yourself. Your choices are not restrictive. However, I did get to a point, early on, where it felt like I was being constrained to a certain path through the world because so many of the combat situations I was getting into were unwinnable. A couple of turns against the AI and I was dead. This was slightly frustrating as it meant a good deal of trial and error and quite a bit of backtracking. Ultimately it felt like a waste of time. But the counter argument is that it falls in line with the games mechanics. It does not lead you from one point to the next. You have to figure stuff out for yourself.  So yes, I’m very happy I picked this up and would absolutely recommend it, certainly from the position of someone who is perhaps typically more into action games than RPGs.  I’ll definitely be picking up the original Divinity once I finally finish this game."
Prykie1995,235,2,0,"December 16, 2017",Recommended,141.8,"Can't sing this game's praises high enough. I begrudgingly bought it, largely out of principle, having heard of it being brilliant and that it was independently developed and published, thinking that I might not like it or give up on it. But I didn't, and now i'm here telling you to buy it.  I started the game up and thought it felt too slow, too cumbersome and somewhat bloated, with just the first area taking near enough half an hour to an hour to fully explore and understand what's going on. It got even worse when I got to the next area. ""god this drags on"" I was thinking, ""when's the proper fighting and loot fest stuff gonna happen?"" I thought. In hindsight, I definitely didn't understand the pace of the game and the focus of it at all. After having put in over 50 hours I can now say that this game, for what i've played, is a masterpiece.   It shares similarities with games like diablo or torchlight, but with mechanics and design choices that make you consider every little move you make, this game manages to scratch at more and more layers of depth and forces you to explore options you wouldn't otherwise if not for the firm but fair difficulty. The AI is clever. It doesnt just bash at you with anything/everything, it picks and chooses what it needs to do to take you down. It picks off the weak, avoids the strong and weakens the immovable by using the environment and the creatures therein to it's advantage. For instance, there is a skill in the game that let's you kill an enemy if your character dies. Having cast this, the enemy's allies, themselves unaffected by this skill, will avoid killing your character but WILL proceed to weaken and immobilise you so that when it wears off they can take you down. They work things like this out and have clear strategic formations you need to counter.  It's one of the most rewarding experiences: coming into a fight fully unprepared, as the underdog, only to walk out the other side the victor. You know it was because YOU made the critical choices needed to win that battle against the odds and against a genuinely THINKING cpu opponent. It's fantastic.  The way the game feels to play when you're fully invested is unparralleled. There is an absolute deluge of content if you seek to complete it all and the way the game gives you utter freedom to do whatever you want/need/can do is both daunting and refreshing at the same time. The difficulty is fine tuned to perfection, where small mistakes can be cleverly worked around but rushing can easily get you killed.   Take your time, learn the ropes and think about each and every move as if it's your last, that's when the game is at it's best.    BUY IT"

Avascar,117,2,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,209.2,"What's makes an RPG? This game exceeds almost all of my expecations, and wipes away all of my fears. Engrossing writing, lovable characters, engaging combat, challenging choices, great soundtrack, and CO-OP. It's hard for me to not love this game in every aspect. And surely, it's a game that's difficult to top. Do note I will mostly talk about the main campaign, because it's what I put the most hours into.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a video game designed to look into your very soul, and asks a very direct question, 'Who are you?'. You can make a custom character, or one of the six origin characters (with specific dialogue, unique quests, and a generally different experience), and take part in an adventure alone, with NPC companions (with their own personality and relationship with you), or actual players. It goes back to the roots of RPG's, and gives you ultimate freedom to do and be whoever you want to be. To be whatever or whoever you want. And your choices matter, for every kill and every choice changes the world in some way. The world is real. You're in an adventure.  From the voice acted merchants, to the bustling cities and towns, you'll manage to find every nook and cranny as this game is filled with secrets only meant for the die-hard explorers. Different dialogue choices, hidden quests, OP loot, completely different outcomes; the world reacts to how you behave and what you know. Whether you decide to become the traditionalist hero, to the megalomaniac villian. The choice is ultimately up to you, and the game respects that. No choice nor fight is as black and white as they seem, as everyone in the story is both good and bad in their own rights (probably with the exception of the source king). It's a game you can't really have a ""perfect run"" on, choices will grant many different and branching choices based on what you do.  It goes back to the roots of RPGs from the days of Dungeons & Dragons, takes the modernism of current RPGs, and dosed with the whimsical love from Larian into a game that twists you as a whole, showing your true colors. In Co-op, it tests your relationships with your friends, as you must know only one out of the four adventurers can be Divine. It's a game that's both cooperative and yet slightly competitive, and it adds great storytelling to the entire experience.  Not only does the game contain loads of different dialogue, secrets, choices, and outcomes, it has some of the most revolutionary turn-based combat I've seen. Environmental effects from fire, rain, poison, and water. You can spend hours strategizing with your friends setting up the battlefields, as almost every enemy have their own weaknesses and strengths you must overcome. Each fight is interesting to their core, making you adapt to each situation in geography, location, environment, skills, and enemy types.  I only recently completed this game, and I realize it's one of those few games I'll have really fond moments of. It's a game where as soon as you beat it, you'll immediately start another run. I wouldn't mind paying for expansions, because the level of quality that Larian provides is amazingly superb. I don't want to give many spoilers to the game, it is full of many surprises that you must experience yourself. It's unforgettable, I tell you!  Of course, this game isn't perfect. Bugs are rather prevalent, as you literally can't get some achievements. Aside from bugs, I do wish there was more character development between my companions. This isn't an issue when all of your characters are actual people. But when they're NPC companions they don't talk very often, only during specific and important story scenes. If you play solo, there will be times when you don't notice their presence because they never have any dialogue to say, which is a shame in my opinion. I won't dabble on it much, but Act 4 is a bit lame as there isn't as much depth to it compared to Act 1 and 2. This entry of the series also messes up the timeline of the games, which puzzles many previous players like me. And the final boss isn't as magnificant as I wanted it to be (no multiple boss phases!?!).  There's also the Arena mode, which is an online PvP game mode. It's pretty dead, and it seems to be the most rushed out of the 3 (Campaign, Arena, and Game Master). You can only select a few presets of characters (no character nor skill customization), and in my experience I had trouble finding a match to play. I wouldn't play this for the Arena mode because it's pretty awful. The idea is great, but the execution just isn't there.  I also haven't managed to play much of the Game Master mode. A game mode that's quite literally Dungeons and Dragons. There's a rather small following for it, and there are custom campaigns out you can play right now. And from the looks of it, seems very fun. The combat is very streamlined, and the numbers are very easy to manage. I find it better than the use of spreadsheets, very long text documents, or literally piles of papers in my experience. But ultimately, it's personal preference.  But aside from that, everything about this game is fantastic. OST (Main theme, Rivellon, all the character theme songs), aesthetics (perhaps the humans and dwarves are a bit ugly looking), storytelling, dialogue, choices, secrets, combat, mod support, and so much more. Don't think my critiques give you the impression that they ruin the entire experience, because they don't. In the end, you'll feel like you finished an adventure. You mold the game, and yet the game molds you. The world of Rivellon reacts to your moves, with its inner gears shifting and moving. You will tell countless stories of it, I assure you.  So, what makes an RPG? The storytelling experience. And a storytelling experience that allows you to be in the eyes of a child, becoming whoever or whatever you want and having your choices matter in a significant way is an astonishing feat all on its own.  And that, is why I would easily give this game a 10/10. Simply revolutionary."

It is out of all the games I've purchased recently, the most rewarding for the money I spent in time and enjoyment its given me, and I'm not even finished with the game. Far from it.  If you enjoyed Fallout, Fallout 2, The Elder Scrolls series, and other deep RPG's that modern RPG's have moved away from, with all the polish and modern tech of a triple A game, definitely give Divinity 2: Original Sin a go.

If you're a fan of cRPG's in any sense (think Baulder's Gate) you will absolutely love this.   The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, the graphics are great, the gameplay is where it REALLY shines. The fights are difficult, the AI is actually smart, and tactician will put your characters through a grinder when you thought you had it down.  At no point in the game did I feel like it was a slog or a chore to get through during my first playthrough, there was always something meaningful I could do. Just one more side quest before the main story, helping out this one person, talking to this one chicken. The story is also very well done, I feel as though I could actually talk to the characters if they were real people, they are fleshed out very well.   Larian is an extremely awesome company, they delayed the release of the game to add in a fully voiced game due to community request. They listen to their customers, apply the feedback properly, and keep them updated. Definitely the best game company out there right now.  The first act is a very good tutorial, the second act builds the world and the story, and act 3 and 4 take the fun of those two and multiply it by 5. I don't have enough good things to say about this game. The only negative is that it has now ruined so many others for me, because they won't be as good as this. Now I'm bored and don't know what else to start playing.   Ratings: Music: 15/10 (seriously the soundtrack is THAT good) Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Difficulty: 10/10 (has difficulties for all levels of players)  Overall it is a top 3 game that I have ever played.

The best game I've ever played, beating out Divinity: Original Sin by several hairs.   The combat is phenomenal - would love to see a whole plethora of games with similar mechanics, if they could be similarly deep and balanced.  Similar but better than the turn-based gridded games I know - Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy tactics, Advance Wars. These were rough, alpha attempts that were not inspired enough to thresh out the real strategic possiblilities of turn-based gaming, to great depth.   Also just feels good - taking control of and building your characters in this game is particularly rewarding. You know and love them, and become intimately familiar with their capabilities even as throughout they grow in fits and spurts into more powerful, novel, and complicatedly effective beings. Integrating new abilities, talents, and stat proclivities into them is a meaningful test of your tactical control. Choosing those is a test of your strategic wisdom."

ColdWolf,"1,027",2,0,"May 26, 2017",Recommended,238.9,"The single most detailed, challenging and fun cRPG I've ever played. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is not only a deep and meaningful game of tactics, exploration and puzzle solving, but also a master-class in dialogue and writing that shames Original Sin as if it were the work of a child in comparison.  Quests with meaningful choices and justifications, thought-out and deep skill combos that affect your playstyle and experience in combat, a surprisingly intriguing and not at all by-the-numbers story and absolutely NO handholding.  Everything that is great and wonderful about character driven RPGs is here and fleshed out,  I believe I've finally found the game that will let me retire from reinstalling Neverwinter Nights again for good. The only thing I wish they had done is let you roam the entire world like in Original Sin; the chapters are separate areas. They provide ample warning before you leave an area though, so it's not like it's a frustrating mechanic!  There have been complaints about the difficulty of not only the combat but also in solving the puzzles; If you're struggling to solve a puzzle it's because you haven't found all the clues; they're always there somewhere. if you can't beat a particular enemy because he's too strong you're gonna have to come back to him later. The game won't coddle you, you're supposed to learn how to defeat different enemy combinations through hard work and experimentation! The game is equal parts merciless and forgiving, enlightening and mystifying, challenging and fun.   A must-buy, and above all else; we must have a sequel, Larian!  The holiday is over, get back to work developer slaves!"

Dais Spires,41,2,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,51.8,"I love this game. I played the first one for a long time so I was already a fan, but this one is better then the first by far. I love the new class skills, the new races, and simplified crafting system. The game is appropriately difficult, and you will most likely have to do some battles more then once to figure it out. So save often. Build craft is so much fun in the game, and the replay value is very clear from the start. I keep wanting to make new characters just to try things differently. I love Love LOVE playing a Rouge. Teleporting, sneaking, stealing and back-stabbing. It's just the best.   The multiplayer in this game is a lot of fun too. I play with my husband for hours on our days off. We yell at eachother from other rooms to try and figure out a strategy, or when one of use screws up and kills the other. I feel like you wanna play this with someone you really like though, because the first time they accidentally stun you, and ruin your big attack you've been setting up, you'll wanna kill them. I am very glad this game is Co-op though. We need more games like this in the world.   So, get this game. You already want to, or else you wouldn't be here. Just do it. You won't regret it, and if you do, then there is something wrong with you. This game is amazing."

Draceon,77,2,0,February 16,Recommended,22.3,"Story For those who love games like Skyrim, The Witcher, and Dragon Age, this game will be a welcome addition to your arsenal. It possesses background and history which I might in some cases call even better than any of the aforementioned games. Though much is left open to interpretation, the game does provide the player with a handfull of hints. and information. Its not so much that the story is more developed, after all Skyrim, The Witcher, and Dragon Age all have plenty of lore associated with them. However, Divinity has a better way of enticing the player to want to know more. The game isn't simply about finishing the main storyline, its more about the exploration of the world along the way. Your team will have certain skillsets, including a skill called loremaster which allows the player to learn about ancient, newly discovered artifacts. Each race has their own history and the relations between the races continue to devlop and become more known throughout the game. The game feels linear without feeling as though it limits the player, and I find this to be a great thing.  Controls and Perspective One ting that deterred me from playing more of this game earlier was the strange third person perspective, I am not personally used to this top down way of playing and pathfinding issues were sometimes a problem, though they were almost always solvable. It doesn't seem as engaging without the first person view, and in some ways seems more like a MOBA such as League of Legends in the way that the player sees the game. However, the game does allow the player to zoom in to see quite a lot more detail in the character models and the surroundings. It also uses some interesting post processing techniques to blur the backgrounds and have characters stand out when zooming in. However, its easy to get used to andn though perhaps not as immersive as Skyrim and The Witcher, it certainly has its benefits, particularly as pertaining to the combat system, which I will come to later.   Character Creation and Teams There are four races that can be played in the game, each have their skeletal variants which are also playable, these 4 species are dwarves, elves, humans, and lizards. Lizards are my personal favorite, I find them to look quite cool. However, who you pick and how you build them is completely up to you. Your decisions to upgrade certain skills, the race you choose, and the ability you decidie to learn all influence how the game progresses. Lorewise, Lizards are nobles and are often disliked because of their snobbish nature. Elves can eat flesh and learn about what that person was last doing, dwarves seem to be rather talkative, and humans are, well, boring. Because they're human. But while who you choose to play matters, you can still adopt team members from various different races and backgrounds and get their benefits. They can have all manner of classes and specializations. You can be a necromancer, reanimating the dead and using them for your advantage, sucking the life out of your enemies. You can cast air or fire spells to destroy your enemies. Or you can hit people with swords and arrows, definitely not as epic, but still quite important.  Combat System This combat system is one of the most unique, but challenging ones I've seen in a while. I thought turn based had to mean something along the lines of Civ V, but it really doesn't. Turn based combat really adds strategy to this game, you have to position your mages, rangers, assassins, and fighters correctly in order to be able to deal the most damage and keep your team alive. With such a diverse amount of spells and weapons, everything brings something new to the table. There is no undo button and making the wrong choices can lead to costly issues. However, a teammate dieing does not necessarily mean they are dead forever, a resurrection scroll can bring them back to life without too many issues. However, they do take some materials to craft or a lot of money to create.  Choices Matter Each dialogue, every upgrade, every step in combat seems to matter. When a player is given a choice, it is usually important for some reason. Thats part of what I love about this game so much, everything I do can lead to a different outcome. No game gives the player so many possibilities while still holding true to a definite storyline. However, your choices in skills start to matter less in the second act where you can just change your appearance and reallocate skill points. I like being able to change your appearance, but I don't think that reallocating skill points is the best idea. Though I have used it plenty, I feel like it takes away from some of the gravity that your choices have. It does however provide more freedom to change and evolve, which I can't argue with.  Crafting and Trading Yes, this game has crafting, and I'm not quite sure it was a good idea. One issue with this game in particular is that enemies don't respawn, so once you have cleared a camp and killed some enemies, they will never come back. You are essentially done with that zone. And this wouldn't be a problem considering how long it takes to finish the game and that there are so many places to visit, but it doesn't truly favor crafting. Though crafting is a good addition to almost any game, I don't find myself using it that much, the one time I have used it was for a quest. Considering how many items I get all the time from loot, it also doesn't really seem necessary to be crafting in this game. Would there be more opportunity to settle down and if this were more like a sandbox game, then the crafting system would make a lot more sense. I'm not saying this game shouldn't have one, I'm just saying that it doesn't really add to the experience like everything else does. When traidng with NPCs, you often get far less than an item is worth and the items you buy can cost 6-8 times as much. I know a lot of games charge these ridiculous in game prices with the in game currency and you can decrease cost with a skill, but I find this a bit excessive.   The Best Skill No doubt, the best skill is being able to talk with animals. It opens up new quests and oppprtunities, get it on at least one character, its called pet pal. I feel like this should come equipped by default with the main character as it is really important.  Summary All in all this is an absolutely wondeful game, with amazing graphics and intense storyline and lore. You're getting a fully fledged RPG on the level of other triple AAA titles. The player truly gets a sense of freedom whilst still being casually pushed in a direction. Each choice matters, each choice changes an outcome, and everything depends on the players playstyle and preference. Nothing in the story seems out of place, everything fits together, and the only limit to playing through this game is the willingness of those who wish to look deeper into the story. If you like a good/solid rpg game that isn't the standard shooter or hack and slash, then this is a game for you!"

SuicideKing,107,2,0,January 22,Recommended,177.9,"At the risk of heaping too much praise on the game despite not even having left the initial Fort Joy area, it's bloody marvellous.  There are so many paths to take in the story and each NPC interaction feels unique. I'm playing 2 mutliplayer games in parallel, with different characters, and it's played out differently in both cases because of different starting variables and events, along with different player actions. It's really great. BTW, it's not like we haven't escaped Fort Joy because we don't know how to - oh no, we could have escaped at multiple moment, but we chose to stay. Partly to XP farm, partly because there's just so much to do!  Moreover, it addresses the issue i usually have with games that have level systems and loot - the weapons scale with your attributes, and higher level gear can be equipped if you have the appropriate attributes. So for example, if you're playing a melee build and have the appropriate Strength, you can equip level 4 armour while being level 3.  Combat is pretty fun if you're into turn-based stuff. Think ""new XCOM but with Action Points"", but perhaps more chaotic and varied. Spread some oil, set it ablaze. Then chuck poison in it to watch it go boom! Or the other way around.There are pre-defined classes but you can tweak them as you like, and respec any time. I haven't even got to the point where I can use Source abilities yet.  Crafting seems pretty complex, but it's really cool. Find a stick, some rope and a knife - you now have a knife-on-a-stick and can use it as a sword. Find a stick and a large sea shell, you now have a magic staff. Have a potion flask and a poison barrel? Well, now you have a poison flask. Why'd you need a poison flask? Because Undead heal with poison (and get damaged by health/vitality potions).  Anyway, it's an exceptionally well made game. Runs pretty smooth for me at pretty high settings (can't remember, i think it just set itself to ultra, and i didn't have to tamper with the settings) @ 1080p with a i5-3570K, GTX 670 and 8GB of RAM. Haven't encountered any bugs yet. Let that sink in. A game bought 3 months after release, in 2017, has not had a single bug so far, in 20 hours of play.

Snardbuckett,227,2,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,626.6,"At first i was quite apprehensive, i played the game at a friends house in beta and i did not like the direction the game was going at first. The original armor system was akin to mass effect 2 and it felt very rock paper scissors like .... Thanksfully shy of release they made a drastic change in how armor works and he new system is quite refreshing and i like it.  the addition of a band of characters who are not blank slates while still being customizable for how you mechnically want to play the game was freaking brilliant. I love specifically Fane and Lfan the most but all of the characters are this fantastic dichotomy of being terrible people yet relatable people that seem like thier actions are primarily tainted by being on the wrong side of a ""very bad day"".  i think they did  aslightly better job of making it somewhat apparent where and what you needed to do from the get go and the ""tutorial"" section on the ship is great, playing throught the turtorial is drastically better than a pile of exposition to tell you how to play an RPG from the ground up.  Im not 100% sold on the new skill system as better, but it certainly is fluid and doent punish you as harshly for side speccing, i also like that crafting does not require skill investment and that the ""Civil"" skills have been split off so you dont have to try to choose between skewering harder or not sounding like a neanderthal in conversation.  I do however wish crafting seemed more impactful at low levels .... custom crafting your weapons and getting ahead of the curve through exploration theft and smart trading was quite fun in OS1. i find that somewhat removed in OS2 and most crafting early game is primarily for ""consumables"" and the customization of old on your own crafted weapons seems somewhat limited (using essences to add a damage type)  the introduction of more playable character races is a welcome change and the tag system really amps up the replayability to 11. I definitely agree with the sentiment its one of the best game sof the year quite possibly the best yet."

I get angry, you can't fool me, you can't set me up! Naked and without any weapons I attack the robbers, and I kill them all, taking the weapons of their body to finish of the rest, and using my magic to dish out even more damage. In the end, they all drop dead and I'm victorious. I talk to the lizard lady to ask what just happened, she admits they tried to rob me.

Marirow,457,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,44.6," I'd recommend this game if you're a fan of tactical games like XCOM or Fire Emblem, or if you like story-heavy games.  The combat is the strongest part of the game, but it's also the hardest to get into; I had to restart the game multiple times to get the right party structure to tackle the game's challenges.  Adaptability and crowd control are key in this combat system. If you don't have the right party makeup, skills, and items, then it's going to feel like the game is cheating you. Enemies will constantly be inflicting status conditions (usually turn-skipping ones) if your armor isn't up to snuff. A lack of skills means that enemies will be able to out-maneuver and out-damage you. And, of course, having a party of all mages isn't a good idea when archers can just sit and take potshots at you three times a turn. If you're not sure what you're doing, there's no shame in playing on the lower difficulty setting. Trust me.  The other two major selling points of this game are the story and the exploration, both of which are a bit weaker in terms of originality but are just as great as the combat system. The dialogue is your standard Neverwinter Nights affair, made a bit spicier by the Tags system. Simply put, each character has Tags (related to aspects of their personality, history, or appearance) that give unique dialogue options. You can even acquire new tags as you play, making the system versatile as well. The dialogue itself is well-written and hilarious at times, giving the game a comedic twist and elevating it from a drab, boring fantasy adventure. I won't spoil the story, but I'll say that after 30 hours I've only brushed up against what the story has to offer. The thousands upon thousands of dialogue trees are backed up by some impressive voice acting, which makes reading through the game's story (which might as well be novel length, if not longer) actually fun and engaging instead of a slog.  The exploration, then. This is probably the weakest part of the game-- not  bad,  just  weaker.  The world is enormous and full of sidequests, characters, and miniature adventures to go on, which really scratched my explorative itch. However, I often felt that the game wasn't using its exploration elements as well as it could. Quests can only really reward you with money and gear; money always gets hoovered by buying new, better gear from shopkeepers, and gear almost always becomes obsolete as soon as your characters level up. I found myself picking up really cool, unique gear, only for it to be  immediately  replaced by something slightly better. This is on top of a loot system that leaves your inventory constantly cluttered with random garbage, and forces you to check every single empty crate just in case there's a scroll of resurrection inside. I swear, Rivellon has an epidemic of empty crates.  In short, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a  very good game.  My biggest complaints are with the little things. The combat is just a little to obtuse, the exploration is just a little too unimportant, etc. The good things far, far outweigh the bad. If you're a fan of CRPGs, like games that focus on the story, or enjoy tactical combat, this game is an excellent buy."

CosmoCorgi,35,2,0,"November 8, 2017",Recommended,68.2,"If you are a fan of turn-based combat and an RPG that allows creativity instead of limiting it; if you like a game with a decent story, but really are looking for deep game mechanics; if you are looking for an RPG that will allow you to have drop-in and drop-out co-op seamlessly; if you are into D&D and want to make your own D&D map.... THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.  I haven't completed the game yet, but from what I have seen it is definitely my new favorite game of all time. The amount of fun that I have with this game reminds me of when I first picked up Dragon Age Origins. You can create any type of character you want and even change it later if you aren't happen with your choices. The game doesn't really hold your hand, which is nice, and there are many ways to strategize a battle -- use your imagination! If you have a character that is sneaking around you can initiate combat with your other characters and have that sneaky character get into position before engaging.   The crafty is really tricky in the sense that it doesn't really help you. You can pick up books that give you recipes, but if you don't find any books you wont know how to make certain things. There are guides online to help in this regard, however. The amount of things you can craft is seemingly endless. Dozens of spells are craft only spells!  Try a playthrough by yourself to get your bearings, or jump into a game with a guide and have them show you the ropes. The game is best with friends, but it still enjoyable by yourself.  There are bugs, but it is to be expected. Updates are quick and the developer actually listens to the players.  8.5/10"

It's really that great if you into RPG stuff. If you not it's the best place to start. If you have friends who would like to play it with you, it will be your GOTY, for sure.  Pros: Great graphics. One of the best fantasy soundtracks in gaming history. Great campaign with funny, intense moments, scary and entertaining moments. Great writing and overall plot. Huge replayability. Awesome tactical combats. Complex and flexible character building. The best implementation of the coop gameplay in all RPGs ever. Game Master mode for those who would like to play with their friends even after the campaign. A great mod tool that allows you do almost anything in the game. If you willing to spend some time off cause. Content in the game for 100+ hours minimum. Arena PVP mode exists.  Cons: The game still has some bugs. Though all great RPGs has and developers are working really hard fixing them. GM mode could have more love. It lacks a lot of crucial features and a lot of things that exist in the game are unavailable. Though mods in the workshop can help with fixing some of them. Arena PVP mode could have even more love. It's very primitive and it seems like developers haven't worked much on it. Hope they will improve it in the future.  Should you buy it? Definitely!"

The Cons:  .There are a few bugs (turns taking a while to end) but nothing major .It was released without some languages installed last minute, boo hoo most people work so couldnt even play it on release anyway .Look at the negative reviews, 95% of them are ridiculious  Pros: .Everything! The freedom, the charachter creation, the gameplay and the massively in-depth story. .Dont like somebody? be it good or bad, no problem you can just kill them!  If you like turn-based or classic RPG's this is the new King of the Genre.  Larian are the best most honest development studio ever (i kickstartered both their Original sin titles) if they make a mistake they let you know and keep you updated.  10/10 i will buy any larian game in a hearbeat. <------take note ubisoft/EA this is how you make a good game."
Mokona,31,2,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,22.7,"This review is just based on my first impressions of the game. Its worth getting.  There is an insane amount of skills and combos you can do that a single play through will never allow you to see all the cool stuff you can do so the replay value is high. My favorite thing I've discovered in the game is the way recruiting followers works. First you must convince them to follow you to begin with, they dont just come along because you are the ""chosen one"" or some crap. To boot if you like a character you dont have to worry about him being a mage when you are already a mage because each character asks you what you want them to be. No longer are you forced to not take your favorite npc with you or forced to play a class you dont like just to take it with you. You can finally have a balanced party full of npc you find interesting hurrah.  The only thing I would ""complain"" about is the lack of non human races. You got human, dwarf (small human), elf (vegetarian human), and lizard man (finally its not a human). Skeleton variations of all is nice to throw in but I honestly am just done with every fantacy game haveing there races be the 3 over used races, human, elf, dwarf, and then a final race being there own ""custom"" race that just turn out to be another human but blue or something like that. Glad we got lizard men but wish we had a few more.  This game has a lot of thought put into it and it somehow didn't lauch at the $60 price point, with mod support. I expected this to be as dissapointing as pillars of eternity was but just jumping into the character creation and I was already loving the game."

Imagine D&D with one of the best story-telling and smart dungeon masters, and that is the feel of this game. Combat is incredibly in depth and tactical, hard modes require grinding and ingenuity. Sound design, voice work, character designs, class systems are all next level. If you're looking for constant action this might not be the game for you, but if you want to be absorbed into a world, experience an incredibly rewarding feeling when finally beating a fight, and spend hours exploring and shooting off on side quests this is the game for you.

If you're a fan of cRPG's in any sense (think Baulder's Gate) you will absolutely love this.   The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, the graphics are great, the gameplay is where it REALLY shines. The fights are difficult, the AI is actually smart, and tactician will put your characters through a grinder when you thought you had it down.  At no point in the game did I feel like it was a slog or a chore to get through during my first playthrough, there was always something meaningful I could do. Just one more side quest before the main story, helping out this one person, talking to this one chicken. The story is also very well done, I feel as though I could actually talk to the characters if they were real people, they are fleshed out very well.   Larian is an extremely awesome company, they delayed the release of the game to add in a fully voiced game due to community request. They listen to their customers, apply the feedback properly, and keep them updated. Definitely the best game company out there right now.  The first act is a very good tutorial, the second act builds the world and the story, and act 3 and 4 take the fun of those two and multiply it by 5. I don't have enough good things to say about this game. The only negative is that it has now ruined so many others for me, because they won't be as good as this. Now I'm bored and don't know what else to start playing.   Ratings: Music: 15/10 (seriously the soundtrack is THAT good) Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Difficulty: 10/10 (has difficulties for all levels of players)  Overall it is a top 3 game that I have ever played.

Tero,108,2,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,149.5,"My party stumbles upon a hidden mound in a grave yard. None of them have a shovel so the lizard in my party (a prince) is relegated to uncover the grave with his claws. A disembodied lizard leg appears and my prince is given two options, ""Pick up"" and ""Eat."" Naturally I choose ""Eat."" A spirit appears and says ""You Savage! I hope you choke on me!"" giving my lizard prince a curse. I couldn't stop laughing...  There is a lot of humor in this game that is on purpose and a ton that is seemingly accidental. The writing is great and the stories are enthralling. I find myself wanting to complete side quests to find out what happens rather than simply squeezing that last bit of XP. Half the time I walk around after a quest is already completed just to see if there are any additional clues as to why somebody did something.  So far I am really enjoying this game.  =============== Downsides: - There are a lot of bugs. I have found a lot of situations where I have to reload the game. For example; a battle where I can't loot a corpse (the arachnid in the graveyard).  - More bugs. I discovered that the reason I couldn't target enemies in the Driftwood arena was because I wan't zoomed in enough. After I realized this I was able to beat the competition.  - Even more bugs (getting access to a waypoint early because I was on a cliff overlooking it, which allowed me to fast-travel to the waypoint and expedite my storyline). In the end it wasn't a big deal but my quest progress leap-frogged past the initial quest giver ( I met the quest giver long after I defeated the boss)."

Epicjynx,155,2,0,February 12,Recommended,65.0,"Great game, a true RPG and the closest thing to a Dungeons and Dragons video game. There is so much to do in this game, every location has secrets, every NPC can be interacted with (and is voice acted, spectacularly I might add) even animals can be talked to with a certain ability, every quest is written masterfully, and the combat is what all turn based games should strive to be.  I only have 2 complaints, the first is about performance. This game stutters a lot while not being the most graphically impressing and takes up a lot of RAM use. Load times are fairly long and sometimes the sound cuts out for up to 30 seconds.  The second is about multiplayer. It's unplayable for me, after a while it's impossible to connect to an old save, the only way to play is start a new save everytime.  Other than that the game is fantastic, just wish they fixed these issues."

You dont need to have played D:OS1 to enjoy this game. Players of D:OS1 will have some easter eggs. Lighthearted and dark at the same time.  Voiced narrator and characters (every RPG needs one, once you go voiced you cant go back to reading blocks of texts)  Con: Some bugs and performance issues. some sadness at the end (the kind that you get after finishing a really good book with no immediate sequels)  This is one of those games that by the time the credits roll, you want to give the devs a standing ovation.  P.S: if you want front row seats to the main story use Fane as your main character.  If you want an amazing/rich and personal story, pick Lohse. If you want a revenge/redemption tale, pick Ifan/Sebille/Beast If you want to experience a disgraced noble's rise to power pick The red prince.   "

Sure one might actually have to read a few things, but if you like some elements of old RPG games with todays world of graphics, this is an awesome game.  The choices are well thought through, with many options available based on who is simply talking.  It is not a click anywhere type of choice, as you don't get to go back and chose the right path after failing the 3 bad choices.  In that regard the game pace is slowed down. Battles take time to rethink and strategize.   Sometimes you just are not ready, and you need to find better equipment.  The combat systems is pretty much about putting out more damage than the other team can heal and deliver back.  If you ventured into a higher level, there is a good chance you will simly die.  That challange makes it hard to figure out, if you have not found the right strategy or if you need to wait.  Great game.  Well done.

I'm a huge fan of Dungeons and Dragons, I have a group that plays every week, and for the days when I'm not playing, this is the game that will scratch that itch.  There is so much to say about the game even in the small amount I've played, but the long and the short of it is that the sheer amount of choice it gives you is incredible. Already between my two campaigns I've seen large changes between interactions with characters, different quests, and different class combos. I'm very excited to see everything this game has to offer.  And as a final point, I can't believe that this is an Indie game. In my opinion, this is as entertaining as almost any triple A I've played in the last fair while. I believe anyone who enjoys the fantasty/adventure/D&D genre will enjoy this game, absolutely worth the buy!"
Ihnspyre,193,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,23.3,"This is a cRPG done right:  -  awesome graphics -  fantastic combat and background mechanics -  a lot of freedom -  nice voice acting -  very nice soundtrack  The game is a must buy, Larian did almost everything right in the production department, they listened to critics from the first game, they responded positively to suggestions from fans and worked a lot to improve their game.   This game is exactly that, a very WELL MADE cRPG BUT it lacks a few things that some cRPG fans love about the genre.   Firstly, nothing you see in this game is especially interesting from an artistic point of view. The maps are quite big and full of quests and things to do but there aren't too many WAH moments where you can just admire the artistic design of the map. They are mostly FUNCTIONAL and full of content but uninteresting. While games like Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity have awesome dungeon designs, awesome towns (Twin Elms etc.) and fantastic visual landscapes, D:OS 2 has classic maps with meh design and a lot of secrets.   Most of the game has a lighthearted style of writing, classic personalities for characters, kind of boring lore and story. There aren't too many memorable moments throughout the game (I got very close to the end of the game before getting bored of it on another shared account, bought it for Larian deserved support and future updates + multiplayer) and it really does nothing special except for the combat and mechanics (which are great!). The thing is that we are used to cRPGs full of bugs or questionable developer attitude and when an RPG like D:OS 2 comes out, without a lot of bugs, with a lot of content and fantastic gameplay, well, we tend to overrate it.   The humour was okay, not good and not bad. The party dynamics is not as good as Pillars of Eternity and that cRPG is more suitable for my taste (with complex lore and story, a lot of party interaction, fantastic artistic design and soundtrack).   Overall, Larian deserve a lot of support for being awesome hardworking devs but not for imagination, originality or artistic skills."

Best when playing with another player (up to 3 additional players). Tons of lore, story, and ways to deal with most situations. Lots of freedom in how you want to play the game.   Downside is that combat isn't as frequent and leveling does tend to be on the slower side. You'll spend more time gearing up or chatting than doing anything else. Enemies, in general, are on the weaker side, so sometimes combat doesn't feel as rewarding.   Fun moments: -Trying to break into the ship's kitchen ends with the entire ship blowing up. -Battling asssassins in one motel room, while listening to npcs in another room talk about their love life.  -The moment my cousin and I realize the food we've been eating was made of the local law enforcement that continues to go missing.  -The moment my cousin and I realize what the gods were planning leading to a an epic betrayal of all betrayals.  -Failing to save a family from an execution leading to all out war in the oil fields.  -Realizing the badguys at the end had a very reasonable endgame to their scheme that would have led to the best kind of ending you could get in the game.  -Having my cousin backstab me as I attempt to take Divinity for myself (I won't forget this cuz.

YagDridge,191,2,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,32.8,"This game is a true gem. I really enjoyed Divinity: Original Sin but it had many flaws that made my playstyles limited difficulty wise. In this game all those minor/big issues I had with the series is gone.  One of my favorite things about this game is all the dialog options and more are available depending on your race, and tags. The random things you can do and play with your own style to pass are just amazing and leave me with a complete immersive feeling at all times. I'm still in the tutorial zone at nearly 9 hours because im taking it nice and slow while reading all that dialog. A somewhat early review but I've already noticed ALL my nitpicks from the first game have been addressed in this game.  Major improvements that I love from the last game: + More Dialog choices + Recruiting any new member gives you the choice to select their class allowing for a party of your choice as well + Selling an item worth a lot of money gives you quick reputation with traders + Killing someone in town away from everyone doesn't make the entire world hate you in this game + New Classes/Undead! + Very informative tutorial + New armor/movement/combat system that feels perfected for turn based + Inventory enhancements making it really easy to deal with all party members quickly + Co-op + 4 Players + Crafting"
Lobster Dominance Hierarchy,30,2,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,364.3,"Great game! The Larian team has done it again. I'm happy for them, especially considering the studios history when they were taken advantage of in the past. I particularly like the shout outs and throwbacks to the DOS1, and I'm no where near done the game yet. If you are wanting a role playing strategy game where you actually interact with your companions, and who have their own motives/goals then this is the game for you.  Pros: - More skills. Dear God the old game was lacking in skill variety, really noticable late game. Good to see they improved this. - Diologue is great! - Lore is great! - Deatail in game world - Humor, and a at times snarky narrator - Different ways of solving a quest  Pro/Con: - Graphicks are amazing as ever, but lag the heck out of your computer when you are in the forest/city and not in a building - Crafting is more streamlined but waaaay harder when experimenting as it's less straightforward as DOS1. Good/bad I don't know.  Cons: - Still a little bugy/brocken quests. Nothing too serious as there is ushally a work around. But I came accross my first broken quest bug in Act 2, as in no way to start it as item didn't appear in inventory. Also the game sometimes crashes, so be sure to save often, especially if you open up a new window to google something.  So there you have it a great game, and dare I say if the studio waited a month to release the game to fix these bugs the game may have even been called immaculate? Hope it gets some more patches soon!  EDIT: A little deeper into the game and a little saltier at some of the bugs, *cough* tarquin *cough* as I found a few more broken quest bugs. This game is definitely released a month too early. Still a great game... just waiting on some more patches..."

Richboy MLG,63,2,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,190.5,"This brief review is based on my 40-hour gameplay as im still roughly at 30% completion!  I'll keep this short. This is a SUPERB CRPG. Score : 9/10   The story is very well written set in a fascinating world where CHOICES MATTER. The sidequests are very diverse unlike most games that are filled with fetch quests.   The turn-based combat is very engaging as it rewards you for controlling the battlefield and keeping everyone alive (very important). Patience is key here to prepare setups and counter some status effects (magic and physical).  The early game is VERY tough, much like Xcom 2 where your gears are underleveled so killing enemies at this point is frustatingly difficult even at Classic Mode. Also, once you're done with 1 major area, you'll have to move to a different region so you can't return back to finish any incompleted tasks. So take your time and LEVEL UP!"

There are few good game studios left out there, ones that really seem to love what they do and seem to be happy as long as they make money, not trying to squeeze every damn cent they can out of their fans, and more and more game studios seem to go this route, luckally we have some great studios that resist like CDPR and Larian, I try my best to not fall into brand loyalty and all that crap, but Larian really deserves it.

Far better than any other games I've played.  You get to know each character of your group and every actions you make WILL impact future quests.  I could talk hours and hours about that magnificient game, but I don't have time for that. I'd rather play this over and over and over again.  The Soundtrack is amazing, and after playing 80hrs, listening to any song brings nostalgia. Each time I log back on this game, I wish I havn't played it already to revive this awesome story.  If you play the game like it should be played and you actually care for the dialogs, which are f**cking awesome btw, there's between 60/80 hours of play time ahead.  11/10. Thanks for making this game. I hope there's another one upcoming."
Luis,"2,122",2,0,"October 15, 2017",Recommended,240.2,"Absolutely incredible.  Basically feels like going from Baldur's Gate 1 to 2 (though not quite, since that was continuing from low level to midrange and then to epic levels with the same narrative, and this is not that), since the new armor system involves you either taking advantage or PEELING off layers of armor before you can actually do things.  Positioning and elemental manipulation are somehow even more important this time around. Fortunately, a lot of the difficult encounters are not initiated until you finish a dialog, so one has plenty of time to position  the party as one sees fit.  The original one was an amazing game that I spent hundreds of hours on, but never actually finished. This so far  is shaping up to be an even more impressive experience that I will revisit over and over.   That being said, it is slightly disappointing that the premade dwarf character has extremely little relevance to the plot until the 4th act, and then it is tangential. Oh well."

Quorra,295,2,0,"November 7, 2017",Recommended,109.0,"Despite the changed dialogue system (no rock-paper-scissors anymore), this successor of D:OS is awesome. The origin characters all have interesting stories and it's fun to reveal them. I also liked the main story more than the one from D:OS. Graphics are fine, the soundtrack is great.   The round based combat sometimes requires patience, especially with larger groups and enemies who are able to charm or cripple your characters. But it works. There are still some bugs which hopefully will be fixed over time."

I poured countless hours into the first D:OS and fell in love with the game. I was truly blown away by that game. When D:OS 2 became available as early access I immediately bought it to support Larian even though I waited til full release to play it. So far I've put 45 hours into the D:OS 2 and I'm playing on tactitian mode and I'm far from beating it but from everything I've seen so far this game further enhances and polishes the experience from the first game. I have zero complaints, this game is basically perfection. I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in the genre. It's a mechanicaly deep rpg with a great cast of characters, lore and combat. The game doesn't hold your hand and the story and quests unfold naturally. This isn't a game to rush through, you'll find the most joy out of it if you take your time and explore the world it has to offer. Years later I still think of my experience with the first D:OS, I can only imagine the long lasting impression this game will leave on me."

"""the"" Chase",324,2,0,"October 8, 2017",Recommended,173.1,"This is the best game I've had the pleasure of playing (and backing) since the witcher 3. Easily my game of the year. I highly suggest you play coop because the dimension it adds to the game is so much fun as you and friend(s) just run into all the quirks and silliness. Every fight can be one if you just switch it up and try out new tactics.. or just get lucky! The amount of details and love put into this game makes AAA companies look like indie developers.  The game is not without its flaws, the crafting is shallower than it can be, some armors/weapons never would have a use in someone who wants to win, misclicking on things in battle can really mess up a long fight and turn the tide negatively and the rest is mainly just nit-picky stuff.   Overall this game is a solid product, it looks nice, it plays nice and its completely mastered the art of an rpg in a sandboxm, meaning you have rules and tools, but you can often abuse or mess around and accomplish things in interesting ways. This game is worth the cover charge and should be a no-brainer if you are on the fence and it is on sale!"

You will curse in front of your PC, ♥♥♥♥ you! die! eat this you piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥ BURN! Yeah, it is like that. Its an emotional game, talk to your characters, love them, hate them, see them evolve.  You will not believe the skill progress in this game, what you can become during this game... it will be sutil, slow,  but at some point it you will realize how terrifyingly powerful you are. And it feels good. And the game is still hard, battles are long and tactical. You can still die, but damn you can put up a fight. And the ending... amazing, Its very satisfying. You will not be dissapointed. It has its bugs and some uncompleted quests but nothing serious.  Enjoy amazing writing, amazing story, and amazing characters. It ended and all i have is an aplause. This is how its done.  This is a game for those times when you feel like diving into a LONG story and experience it. It will be your story, enjoy."
Dook Dic Gamer,594,2,1,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,209.4,"I have not play this kind of game for a long time, A Classic RPG that improve on everything on it genre. The Freedom is just MASSIVE!!   I already builded 5 Charectors all on Classic Difficulty,  A Fighter Noble Soldier who try to help everyone he can travel with Red Prince ,Lohse and Fane.  A Lone Wolf Rogue who steal everyone but help those in need. A Noble Ranger Elf travel with Sebille. A Necromancer who I still don't know what to do with her. An Elf Ranger who I play Co-op with my friend.  A Fighter already out of Fort joy, A Noble Ranger Elf running around try to fine everything that we can do in Fort joy. What I find is every fastified, there is at least 3 solid ways to get out of Fort Joy if you play solo[one guy in party], Fight your way out, Boat, Secret ways and if have others in party, Teleport is also an option.  I didn't go far because I want to try to build a different class and see how they perform, I also wanna know what Fort Joy have to offer, and I enjoy it a lot...  Bewarn This game doesn't tell you what to do, this for some are bad... but for me, I believe others will love it. Don't know what to do? Ask around and you will find interesting side quest, and some hint of something bigger outside...This make discover more reward, no quest marker to make you feel like you're stupid or lazy quest writer who don't have to write a good paragraph because quest marker already done the job.  Reading also be negative for some, I'm Thai and English is my 2nd-language but still have trouble with it yet.  Gameplay Combat is turnbase which sadly turn others away... But believe me...This is Deep and every fastify Turn-Base game, making combo with class build, party and your surrounding make a turnbase game yet every dynamic and good gameplay.  Graphic is so beatiful,  magics and skills are very well presented  Sound/Audio is very well done  especially theme song...I love it  Performance Quite good 60+fps even thought Turnbase gameplay's FPS isn't that important...

""This is now my game of years, it's worth my money and I enjoy every moment of it"" I wanna say that but will wait till they fix the crash It's still don't stop me from playing though...

Avascar,117,2,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,209.2,"What's makes an RPG? This game exceeds almost all of my expecations, and wipes away all of my fears. Engrossing writing, lovable characters, engaging combat, challenging choices, great soundtrack, and CO-OP. It's hard for me to not love this game in every aspect. And surely, it's a game that's difficult to top. Do note I will mostly talk about the main campaign, because it's what I put the most hours into.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a video game designed to look into your very soul, and asks a very direct question, 'Who are you?'. You can make a custom character, or one of the six origin characters (with specific dialogue, unique quests, and a generally different experience), and take part in an adventure alone, with NPC companions (with their own personality and relationship with you), or actual players. It goes back to the roots of RPG's, and gives you ultimate freedom to do and be whoever you want to be. To be whatever or whoever you want. And your choices matter, for every kill and every choice changes the world in some way. The world is real. You're in an adventure.  From the voice acted merchants, to the bustling cities and towns, you'll manage to find every nook and cranny as this game is filled with secrets only meant for the die-hard explorers. Different dialogue choices, hidden quests, OP loot, completely different outcomes; the world reacts to how you behave and what you know. Whether you decide to become the traditionalist hero, to the megalomaniac villian. The choice is ultimately up to you, and the game respects that. No choice nor fight is as black and white as they seem, as everyone in the story is both good and bad in their own rights (probably with the exception of the source king). It's a game you can't really have a ""perfect run"" on, choices will grant many different and branching choices based on what you do.  It goes back to the roots of RPGs from the days of Dungeons & Dragons, takes the modernism of current RPGs, and dosed with the whimsical love from Larian into a game that twists you as a whole, showing your true colors. In Co-op, it tests your relationships with your friends, as you must know only one out of the four adventurers can be Divine. It's a game that's both cooperative and yet slightly competitive, and it adds great storytelling to the entire experience.  Not only does the game contain loads of different dialogue, secrets, choices, and outcomes, it has some of the most revolutionary turn-based combat I've seen. Environmental effects from fire, rain, poison, and water. You can spend hours strategizing with your friends setting up the battlefields, as almost every enemy have their own weaknesses and strengths you must overcome. Each fight is interesting to their core, making you adapt to each situation in geography, location, environment, skills, and enemy types.  I only recently completed this game, and I realize it's one of those few games I'll have really fond moments of. It's a game where as soon as you beat it, you'll immediately start another run. I wouldn't mind paying for expansions, because the level of quality that Larian provides is amazingly superb. I don't want to give many spoilers to the game, it is full of many surprises that you must experience yourself. It's unforgettable, I tell you!  Of course, this game isn't perfect. Bugs are rather prevalent, as you literally can't get some achievements. Aside from bugs, I do wish there was more character development between my companions. This isn't an issue when all of your characters are actual people. But when they're NPC companions they don't talk very often, only during specific and important story scenes. If you play solo, there will be times when you don't notice their presence because they never have any dialogue to say, which is a shame in my opinion. I won't dabble on it much, but Act 4 is a bit lame as there isn't as much depth to it compared to Act 1 and 2. This entry of the series also messes up the timeline of the games, which puzzles many previous players like me. And the final boss isn't as magnificant as I wanted it to be (no multiple boss phases!?!).  There's also the Arena mode, which is an online PvP game mode. It's pretty dead, and it seems to be the most rushed out of the 3 (Campaign, Arena, and Game Master). You can only select a few presets of characters (no character nor skill customization), and in my experience I had trouble finding a match to play. I wouldn't play this for the Arena mode because it's pretty awful. The idea is great, but the execution just isn't there.  I also haven't managed to play much of the Game Master mode. A game mode that's quite literally Dungeons and Dragons. There's a rather small following for it, and there are custom campaigns out you can play right now. And from the looks of it, seems very fun. The combat is very streamlined, and the numbers are very easy to manage. I find it better than the use of spreadsheets, very long text documents, or literally piles of papers in my experience. But ultimately, it's personal preference.  But aside from that, everything about this game is fantastic. OST (Main theme, Rivellon, all the character theme songs), aesthetics (perhaps the humans and dwarves are a bit ugly looking), storytelling, dialogue, choices, secrets, combat, mod support, and so much more. Don't think my critiques give you the impression that they ruin the entire experience, because they don't. In the end, you'll feel like you finished an adventure. You mold the game, and yet the game molds you. The world of Rivellon reacts to your moves, with its inner gears shifting and moving. You will tell countless stories of it, I assure you.  So, what makes an RPG? The storytelling experience. And a storytelling experience that allows you to be in the eyes of a child, becoming whoever or whatever you want and having your choices matter in a significant way is an astonishing feat all on its own.  And that, is why I would easily give this game a 10/10. Simply revolutionary."
Mr. Sinister,154,2,0,"October 2, 2017",Recommended,83.2,"Finally. A ROLE playing game in this day and age.  So many small things to find, so many big things to explore. Walls of text. Tangible choices. Pickpocketing for actual valuables and not some pocket fluff? Yes please, you have it right here. Man, this is such a good game. Although the statcheck dialogue options seem to almost always fail kinda seem wonky. But hey, maybe even investing into Persuasion is actually viable this time around? Mostl likely!"
Blood-Lord,119,2,0,"September 23, 2016",Recommended,170.0,"I don't normally prepurchase video games. However, for Larian Studios which created a fantastic game in Divinity: Original Sin I will gladly support this game as well.  Rock, Paper, Scissors: The game play seems close to the original, with minor tweaks and additional combat strategies to worry about. The one thing I've noticed that was missing is where is the rock, papers, and scissors argument from the first game? I loved disagreeing with my friends and having to do this mini game.  From what I can tell the game play feels smoother, looks crisper and the amount of details that they've added to the game. I feel like what ever I do might have repercussions through out the game. Also, they seemed to have created multiple ways of completeing quests, or taking different routes to do the same job.   Source:  I understand that source spending spells are much more powerful than non-source spending spells. However, I believe after even 1 play through gathering source will become tedious and cumbersome. There needs to be a better way to gather this resource than swapping a wand/item with vamperism among the players.  Source solution?: I would like to note that doing this to the dead bodies is very enjoyable. It makes the game that much more immerism. Not sure how to improve upon this to make it more efficent? Maybe devour all sourcible dead bodies around you with one spell cast? However, only the number of source points that you're missing. This will keep the immerism of the spell, yet make gathering this material that much faster.   Source Soul Jars: Side note on the source resource. If you're able to suck source from the undead with an item. Whats the significance of stealing the souls from those stuck in a jar? Aren't these source captures suppose to be more potent or have more of a permanent touch to the character? From absorbing these souls you're loosing out on experience and possibly dialog with characters in this world.  These should be rare and have an additional progress to the characters in their own way. Maybe such as leadership adds bounses to the character. Doing this will add minior bounces to the character who devoured the soul. Bracchus Rex was doing things similar to this and became extremely powerful. Why can't we?  Also, doing this should reduce your attitude towards people to balance this out. #DarksideFTW :D  Act 1 Final Battle: Most encounters in the first act I had no problem. I understand that this game takes tactical placement, and combat very serious. Which is why I love games like this. Admittedly I am no fool when it comes to games like this. However, I would like to address the final battle of act 1. I believe this battle to not be challenging... Just way over powered to the players level and gear.   My friend and I were level 8 with all the quests, and gear that we could get from this island. However, when we got to this it was like hitting a giant wall. Took us around 2-3 hours to complete this battle with numerious amounts of tactics. Finally, I gathered the idea of getting all the explosive oil/ooze barrels on the island that remained and blow Alex and the worm to hell.  Here is a screenshot of what we did to kill the bastard.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769604881   Bug Dwarf Height: While going to Bracchus Rex's castle theres a part where you need to touch a gargoyle head to go through a portal. While doing this our dwarf in the party wasn't able to reach this gargoyle. Heres a screen shot of that below  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769608678   Arena Dead but Still Kicking Bug: After doing the arena and loosing to my friend. I was killed, but immediately revived going back to the arena master. My walking animation looked like I was dead, but still moving. Heres a screen shots of that below.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769176176 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769176554   Overall, if you enjoy turn based, rpg, in depth tactical combat with a very in depth storyline and involvement. This is the game for you!  P.S: This review is bound to change if I think of anything else to add."
Sir Bartholomew,168,2,0,"October 2, 2017",Recommended,63.8,"What can I say that hasn't been said over 8,000 times? This game gives you complete control over what your character does and says. And I don't mean in the sense of ""Oh, I can walk over here and I have dialogue options."" I mean that if you don't like one of those Main Quest essential NPCs, you can attack and kill them. Few games take this risk, but Divinity: Original Sin 2 does and does it beautifully. It gives you options upon options on ways to accomplish your goals and completing quests. I have 25 hours in the game, all of them spent inside Fort Joy, re-loading, restarting and trying to make sure I didn't screw quests up. One quest has you find a dog's lost mate (if you have Pet Pal that is) and you eventually find her in the dungeons. Little did I know, if you escape the fort and then come back, every Magister and Source Hound will attack you on site. So I loaded back to make sure I could talk to the dog and complete the quest without killing his ex-mate.The game feels like a true virtualization of a DnD campaign. Where you choose your actions, the narrator narrates what happens and the world and people react. I've never played a game like this because I was always turned off to turn based combat in video games. But this game does it beautifully, incorporating strategy into the placement of every character and making the environment interactable with different elements and being able to use the landscape your advantage. The enemies can also do this, and will do it more as you turn up the difficulty. I had an enemy cast rain and, before my next turn, one of her cronies shocked my entire party. The rain and standing water caused by it allowing the spell to travel through the party. It's unbelievable what they were able to achieve with this game and I honestly can't wait to see what happens next"

Operator Rosell,46,2,0,"October 21, 2017",Recommended,35.1,"Bought the game 3 days ago. Playtime atm 17 hours. Need to be careful with this lads.  Pros -Amazing soundtrack. I have found myself stopped playing 2 times and just listening the soundtrack cause i think it might change if i enter other area. This has not happen to me since Final Fantasy 10. -NPCs are really well written and voice acted. I was amazed by Fane, The Red Prince and the Assasin dude in the beginning. Thats my 3 people party btw. -Turn based combat is really good. It is also challenging even on the lowest level on difficulty. -Game looks amazing with max graphic settings. The water makes me wanna jump in there and swim. -Quests and their completion is done really well. Not one quest feels like a chore and there is actually no direct markings on the map on where to go. It might show you a location of a NPC or location but the rest you have to figure out by yourself. Really nice oldschool vibe init. -I have only been out of the tutorial island and it took me 17 hours. I cant imgaine how much content there is for the rest of the game.  Cons: -Battle might be frustrating in the beginning if you are not familiar with the skills. It took me several attemps on several quests on the normal mode until my party was not demolished by the mobs. This is not really a bad thing cause we need more games that makes us learn the gameplay and try our best but i understand it might frustrate some poeple. -Camera. Camera is pain if you try to change the view all the time but you have to do it in order to loot everything. It takes some time to get used to.  Overall this game is really amazing. It gives me this deep athmospere like when i furst used to play Arcanum or Icewind dale. Totally recommended."
Tally,119,2,0,"November 28, 2017",Recommended,42.0,"Pros:  Absolutely epic!  Fantastic story, nicely done turn-based combat, huge character build variety with endless skill combos, beautiful environments & soundtrack.  There are things to see and do in every corner of the world.   ---  Cons: Camera controls are severely lacking.  The game is so beautiful and I can't see most of it because of the awful camera controls.  Quest tracker leaves a lot to be desired.  I feel like when the fate of the world is hanging in the balance and there is much work to be done, your hero should be writing down a bit more detail in their journal.  ""My lizard friend wants me to find a lizard.""  That's it, no detail and pestering your lizard friend yields no additional information.  I'm just supposed to walk around and talk to EVERY npc until I find the right one.  There is a fair amount of back & forth that is starting to feel tedious.   For example: you stumble upon Z location, but in order to progress through the zone you need X item that is found in Y location.  Go to Y location.   In order to progress through Y location and obtain X item, you must travel to B location to do a quest and unlock a special ability. Go to B location to do said quest and obtain the special ability. Return to Y location, obtain X item, return to Z location. Basically every main story quest is like this, maybe it's because it's my first play through and I'm still learning, but it's getting a little repetitive.  At 25 hours in my save game seems to be getting a bit bloated.  I had this game on my mechanical hard drive and it takes a solid 5 minutes to load Reaper's Coast.  It's a bit less on an SSD but still pretty bad.  ---  Despite all of that, I still think that this game is absolutely worth every penny.  I can see myself playing this game for a long time."

audaciousgenre,246,2,0,"October 23, 2017",Recommended,365.8,"One of the most flexible, polished, detailed, and generally enjoyable games I've ever played. If you like RPGs, you should play this game. Easy to pick up, gameplay can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.   Every character and NPC is voice-acted with individual dialogue, even down to the animals wandering around town - I've never encountered two NPCs who said the same thing. This may not sound huge, but it's a subtle effort that makes the entire experience far more immersive than I've seen in a game. For instance, talking to every random person in a town never feels boring or a chore. It's one of many seemingly minor decision by the creators that elevates the polish and feel of the game above other RPGs, and exemplifies the attention to detail put into every aspect of the game.   The mechanics are great, the graphics are great, controls are great, crafting is good (haven't played with it too much yet), music, writing and voice-acting are absolutely top-notch, skill/magic trees are flexible and mean you can essentially turn anyone in your party into whatever you want. Build archers who also summon and buff creatures to fight for you, two-handed-axe-wielding close-combat necromancers, seriously whatever you want.  I love this game - I'm not even halfway through it, but I already want to start another party just to try out new party builds.  Just get it, unless you're on a serious budget, and even then, it's probably worth skimping on groceries or something this month."

Luis,"2,122",2,0,"October 15, 2017",Recommended,240.2,"Absolutely incredible.  Basically feels like going from Baldur's Gate 1 to 2 (though not quite, since that was continuing from low level to midrange and then to epic levels with the same narrative, and this is not that), since the new armor system involves you either taking advantage or PEELING off layers of armor before you can actually do things.  Positioning and elemental manipulation are somehow even more important this time around. Fortunately, a lot of the difficult encounters are not initiated until you finish a dialog, so one has plenty of time to position  the party as one sees fit.  The original one was an amazing game that I spent hundreds of hours on, but never actually finished. This so far  is shaping up to be an even more impressive experience that I will revisit over and over.   That being said, it is slightly disappointing that the premade dwarf character has extremely little relevance to the plot until the 4th act, and then it is tangential. Oh well."

Ghouleh,354,2,1,February 18,Recommended,318.0,"A beautiful cluster****.   Full disclosure - the only other game in the Divinity series I've ever played to completion is Dragon Commander, which couldn't be more different than this one.  I didn't enjoy Original Sin 1. I didn't get it. It was so strange to me - because it was a mechanics-focused RPG. Everything interacted with everything else, and the possibilities seemed endless. The story didn't grab me, and such things are important in a cRPG, and so I eventually abandoned it.  Initially, I was afraid I would feel the same about Original Sin 2. The first act isn't particularly strong, but thankfully, I endured for enough time for the story to sink its hooks into me. Ironically enough, it was only then that I realized all of Original Sin 2's virtues, which have little to nothing to do with its plot.   The Mechanics Original Sin 2, like its predecessor, is about the absolutely ludicrous shenanigans you can pull off both in and out of combat. Environmental hazards are everywhere, from water to blood to poison to ice to fire- and they interact in often explosive ways to different skills, items and spells. The game gives you access to the game-changing Teleport skill very early on, and this is what blows the whole thing wide open. With it, you can teleport any character or item, anywhere within sight. The sheer amount of battlefield and exploration applications were enough for me to force all my party members to learn it. Teleport party members across chasms, onto vantage points. Teleport distant enemies to kill zones, environmental hazards, or on top of one another.   Another beautiful example is the dialogue system. Namely - dialogue only freezes the characters that are actively engaged in said dialogue. Whilst your main character is speaking to a soon-to-be-hostile NPC, the rest of your party can get into position, set up traps and hazards, pickpocket the distracted NPC, or even teleport them around the map, all before combat even starts.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is very exploitable by nature. The amount of cheese strategies available to creative players is utterly disgusting - and this is clearly intentional, and I love Larian for it. I watched a video that involved the almost useless Telekinesis skill, which is used solely for moving and picking up objects at the distance - used to instagib monsters and NPCs by way of shoving an ultra-heavy crate filled with other, ultra-heavy crates.  You can customize your characters to a laudable degree, even with the option of making them Undead, which of course brings all sorts of wacky interactions, such as having to steal faces not to be attacked on sight, being damaged by healing  but healed by poison. You can create your characters if you wish, or you can use pre-built characters the game already has. In truth, there is no downside to this. The advantage of pre-built characters is that they have their own voice actors, personalities and, critically, personal quests which they progress through along with the game's main quest. You can customize everything else about them during character creation - class, attributes, even appearance. There are very few upsides to playing a non-pre-built character.  You can have a party of up to 4 characters (there are 6 pre-built characters), or up to two Lone Wolves(a talent which makes characters stronger, but limits them to a party of two). You must choose a -main- character, though you can choose any among your party to partake in dialogue. You will largely see the world through the eyes of your chosen main character.   tl;dr - A blast. I was foolish not to have realized it before.    The Story and Characters Larian has always had a distinct style that blends fantasy and humor. In that, they remain entertaining as ever. The story, as I've said before, took a while before showing what it is truly about, but once it did, it remained engaging throughout. The plot itself isn't as good as an Obsidian would make it, and the characters are more threadbare than Bioware would craft them - but they're good, make no mistake.  I've heard some confusion from longtime fans of the Divinity series about if this game is a prequel or a sequel to some earlier games in the franchise. There doesn't seem to be much consensus, as it could be either, with radically different implications for each possibility. As a person who hasn't played the games that more directly tie into this one, such as Divine Divinity and the Dragon Knight games, things can sometimes seem disjointed and barely explained. Lucian, the Black Ring, Deathfog and the fall of the elven kingdoms, Source and Sourcerers(and how it is different from ordinary magic), Godwoken - It all took a while to fit into place.   And Malady? I was profoundly confused. I like the character, but she seems to drop from the sky at the end of Act I and takes the reins of the entire plot with little to no explanation about the whos, whys and whats. And- heck, Windego, the game's intro narrator. Why she narrates the plot, and seems to take such an important role in narrating the ending - is a mystery.  The game's characters are mostly serviceable. The pre-built party members are a cut above the rest. Well, all except Beast. I remain disappointed how dwarves are depressingly similar in all of fantasy. Putting on a pirate hat doesn't make one different enough. They even have elves in Divinity be gangly cannibalistic weirdos - but dwarves remain dwarves.  The endings are also a disjointed mess, full of moving parts and stuffed at the end of a final battle that ends rather abruptly(and lets not forget the blatantly defective or just badly designed Anathema questline, which pays off about as much as the Mutated Toe in Fallout 2). Still, there's no denying that they're a better payoff than, let's say, Tyranny's endings.  The cRPG genre has fierce competition in story and writing, and I believe that Larian found a handy way to go about things: The interveawing between the main plot and the individual (pre-built)character stories. The grandiose story runs the risk of making a protagonist feel like a nameless, faceless nobody that murderhobos his way to the end - but each character's personal quest is craftily sewn into the world's larger story, which gives precious context and a feeling of being connected to the game's events. This shouldn't be overlooked.   Finally, Original Sin's Pet Pal talent returns triumphantly, allowing you to speak to each and every animal in the game, which not only grants you access to tons of new quests and content, but also up the comedic factor by several orders of magnitude. I will never forget the amazing bringing the sole survivor chick Peeper on an epic journey to find his Sourcerer father, the epic rooster Magicockarel.   In Conclusion It's pretty good! A mechanics-focused cRPG that teleports you♥♥♥♥♥first into a barrel of fun."

Pros  -Incredibly depth, but not too much to be overwhelmed -Fantastic story and setting -Great soundtrack and vocals -This game as a whole oozes rich character -Dangerous and rewarding combat -More fun with friends -All around excellent RPG   Cons  -Some bugs here and there, nothing game breaking -Story telling with friends can be hard to keep up with. You have to manually listen in. By the time you realize someone is talking, they're already deep into the conversation and you've missed out  10/10.

Sandwich Boy,400,2,0,March 13,Recommended,27.6,"This is one of the most immersive games I've played in years.  The graphics are great for a CRPG, the story is engrossing, and every line of dialogue is fully voiced.  There is so much depth in every aspect of the game.  The character customization, crafting system, and combat are some of the best I've seen in any game, let alone any CRPG.  Combat encounters are difficult without feeling unfair.  Others may feel differently, but as a casual player, I found the ""classic"" difficulty setting to be just about perfect.  Combat is turn-based, but it is sort of a mix between tactical turn-based combat, and the classic RTS-Style combat of games such as Baldur's Gate. Players are definitely rewarded for being creative in combat, so simply running the party headlong into an encounter isn't always the best strategy.  The Divinity world has some interesting twists on the generic fantasy setting.  Each quest and side quest feels unique, and characters (even minor characters), are interesting and realistic.  This game also has some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in an rpg, which is crazy, given how much dialogue there is.  The attention to detail is absolutely amazing, resulting in tons of secrets to uncover in the world, as well as complex interactions between items, characters, etc.  Here's a fun example: When a character is wounded in (or out) of combat, blood can splatter onto the ground.  This blood can be frozen, resulting in a slippery patch of ice on the ground, or struck with a bolt of lightning, shocking anyone who is touching the puddle.  The blood could also be absorbed for health by a necromancer.  Somehow the game doesn't feel like it has a steep learning curve, despite all of this richness and complexity.  There's a lot more to say, but I'll keep this review short.  If you have any interest in CRPGs, or RPGs in general, you should check this game out."
Daxwred|Meliconi,352,2,0,February 7,Recommended,71.4,A beautiful game with a delightfully intracate combat system. I played this game with 3 other friends for the main campain and we keep coming back instead of playing some thing else.

Nethys/BlackViking,335,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,80.9,"The Co-op is pretty fantastic, with split screen and online gameplay available. 4-player Co-op is huge, especially when each character has their own backstories, motives, and alignments. Some quests mean you gotta talk to someone, someone else may want that person dead. Sometimes you even gotta fight your friends in a fun arena-style system. Combat is amazing, especially when you have the turn-based gameplay to help stage brutal combos to dispatch multiple enemies. From exploiting elements, to staging ambushes for the enemy you just turned into a chicken, the options are vast. Story so far is pretty ♥♥♥♥ing good. As I stated initially, everyone has their own upbringings and goals that sometimes conflict or align at various parts of the plot. While the beginning of the game seems very linear (""We gotta get out of this place!"") The variety of methods and questlines to accomplish that is guaranteed to bring in a second playthrough. I recommend this game to people who enjoy co-op gameplay, intricate stories, or just solid fantasy RPGs; this game has been a hit on all fronts for me and it feels good to play a sequel that just comes out better than the previous game. "
[EU] DeliveryBoi,325,2,0,July 26,Recommended,165.9,"I consider this the game of the year 2017.  The gaming industry has been lacking super high-quality AAA games that simply tried to create the best possible game in its respective genre - without trying hard to cash-grab and overly cut costs where you really shouldnt. The reception of Witcher 3 simply showed how starved consumers are for such quality-games.  Divinity Original Sin 2...  The game looks absolutely gorgeous. Stunning islands, stunning characters, amazing colors - a feast for the eye.  The universe the developers created is interesting and overall excellent and suits the genre perfectly by adding that extra touch of insanity and therefore supporting player-choices which, quite frankly, are going to be insane more often than not.  The ""R"" in RPG? Delivered.  Replayability - The game often delivers a lot of significant choices how you can influence the world around you and a ton of ways to solve (or terribly mess up) the things you encounter.  Innovation - Modding-support needs to be counted for this one. You can create adventures, mod the base game and even have a complete game-master mode. Features like crafting are an interesting touch for such a game, but can be entirely ignored if youre not into that. Spoiler, if you havent watched the trailer yet:  You can speak with animals, if you pick a trait for that. That's absolutely incredible. Animals simply connect to us on a whole different level. Who wouldnt be touched by some poor, sad puppy eyes, even if its just a game?  The ground-effect based combat is also a nice touch with several connections to that.  The game is fully voiced and even has a narrator. If you really listen closely you can hear that not every voice actor was perfect, but come on, the game is fully voiced and I'm really nitpicky here. Can't hire the best voice actors for a thousand characters and have all of them perform on the same level.  I've got to criticise though that the multiplayer does not have a multiplayer-dialogue function. What I mean by that is that the first player who clicks on the NPC gets to do all the talking without the input of the others. Sure, you can punch each other in Teamspeak and start complaining about choices, but that's no fun. There's a PvP function in the game, but I dont really feel like that's the thing I'd like end up with when I start up a >Coop< session. There should be something like dice-rolls and whoever gets the highest rng, gets to say his line. Something like SWOTOR?.   TL;DR The game offers serious bang for the buck and I'd struggle if you asked me for more recent games of such high quality."
Jaxim,329,2,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,154.0,"I've been pretty burned out on gaming for a few years now, and I've constantly been searching for games that can give me the sense of joy and wonder that I used to feel. At some point it just started feeling like I had done it all before, and very few games truly felt unique or inspired to me.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now on the top of a small list of games that have really reminded me what it's like to have fun playing a video game.  Also, this game has made it seriously hard to justify the $60 price tag on almost any AAA game over the past several years, at least for me."
Tesla_Foxx,106,2,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,16.1,"If you're a fan of classic RPG style gaming (I.e. Baulders Gate, Diablo, D&D, etc.) then this will be your salvation from the lack of major titles in the genre. It stays true to its table top roots while also giving a stylish spin to everything we've had to use our imagination for over the years. The combat is fast paced and tactical. Everything is a weapon, including the environment. It really comes down to what you have available to you and what you can think up with each situation. The story is well written and engaging. It keeps you hooked to see how your particular play through pans out in the grand scheme of the world. Plus the mulitplayer support adds a lot of fun and interesting ideas to the mix. Such as your companions (either real people or a.i.) will each view the quests differently and have different motives and reasoning for every action. Sometimes things work out, other times you end in a bloody brawl after a quest choice turns sour. Each adventure breathes a wealth of choices and possibilities. Don't forget the game master mode either! Being able to create your own adventures for your friends, or anyone for that matter, to battle through is worth the price in itself. There will always be new content to play or create to keep this game going for ages. PVP is also included to add that pinch of competition outside of your main campaign that turns into a explosive game of wits before you know it. All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone seeking adventure or a little more ""choice"" out of their game. Have fun solo or with friends as you fight to replace the divine that the world has lost. May your blades and mind be sharp!"
ItsThePappy,69,2,0,"March 25, 2017",Recommended,5.6,"Even for a game that is in ""Alpha"" for the time being, it is several times more polished and enjoyable then some other games out currently.  The difficulty of battle and the thought that goes into strategy of it all is incredible, although i am biased since i am a huge fan of turn based fights. Can be a bit infuriating at first since most fights you'll get into at first will pretty much destroy you until you get a handle on how it all works.  All in all its a lot to take in at first and that can be discouraging, but pushing through and spending time playing the game and before you know it you'll be enjoying this game more then you thought you would."

It gives a great sense of immersion.   -very difficult for new players to the genre, no handholding (which is a good thing imo) -the inventory is a clusterf**k. If you arent somewhat patient, you will hate it -quirky dialogue sometimes, this can be seen as positive or negative, Id appreciate a more serious tone, though, it keeps a good balance -colors too bright imo  Thats just the things on top of my head. For every rpg fan, especially oldschool pnp or crpgs fans or just people with a little bit of patience, you re in for a GREAT time. Getting back the feeling of playing nonstop without getting bored.

Draenei For Life (Josh),239,2,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,105.4,"GAME OF THE YEAR FOR ME. ALSO if you play this game keep the black cat alive, trust me its so worth it.   SO the good things about this game: The story/writing has vastly been improved saince the first game, I loved the first one but the story never really pulled me in, this one however pulls me in within the first hour. The combat is still as fun and tactical as the first, with far more combinations of spells and abilities (plus waaayyy more spells, classes and abilities in general). The character creation is fun, its not too long and crazy but allows you to make (or customize an existing character) to be the character you wanna play. The companions are all detailed with decent stories and they all have different impacts on the storyline and each other. Gamemaster Mode is incredible fun, it feels like the D&D campaign creator I've always wanted. This game has up to 4 player multiplayer for the full game, so if you have the friends jump into this with them.   Few neutral things: The music is kind of average, a few fun tunes but feels generic. The crafting system is no longer a cluster of confusing rubbish, so its not a negative, it still doesn't feel very important though, on my solo playthrough and playthrough with friend we both ignore it as it feels still not that useful. Arena mode is a rare giggle but feels kind of incomplete. While its very true many quests allow you to do them  in different ways which is fab, some of them matter little, you will be given like 5 options (if you find them all) to finish a certain part however, you can just run back and do the other options for extra xp for killing them (as I do) making the choice slightly pointless.  Bad things for me (or things I think others will hate): The amount of races is fun (including undead versions), however, it feels like every race is here in vast quantities, no race feels rarer. If you do not like turn based combat this game is NOT FOR YOU AT ALL. Your characters pathing when you tell them to go someone in a fight will still decide to  casually run through fire/poison etc, or sometimes attacks of opportunity make ZERO sense. Gamemaster Mode has no way of making character talk, its all up to the GM. Now this last comment is something that just personally annoys me, but when you need to  help a character in a fight (or save them) they have this tendency to just go full in and take huge quantities of damage, they seem to have dumb AI compared to actual enemies.  I hope my review gave some insight on whether to purchase this game."

Tyrvali,91,2,0,"May 15, 2017",Recommended,201.8," Divinity: Original Sin 2  So, Divinity: Original Sin 2...  I have to say several things about this game before I properly review it. 1) It's in early access alpha at the time of review. 2) Only Act 1 is available, alongside an Arena mode. 3) I loved Divinity: Original Sin  Ok, so, for people who loved the first one, this is a must buy. Even at its current stage of development, which Larian Studios are constantly working on and updating, this is amazing. I have played through the first act as several different characters.  Each playthrough has been similar and different in unique ways. For example, I tried to playthrough the game as a solo Elf Cleric.  The Voidworm fight was nearly impossible for me . I then tried a proper playthrough, using a full party. My character was a Dwarf Rogue. Not only are the classes and races completely different, the combinations of combat were entirely different and I loved it.  I will not lie, however. To people who A) haven't played Divinity: Original Sin, it could be hard to get used to, despite the tutorial help boxes. B) Some elements of the story can break. For example, if Gavin dies before making it back to the camp, you cannot progress in his quest. Note: This is not a game-breaker.  Overall: Since I loved the original, I purchased this game early into its alpha. So far, I've loved every minute. I can't wait for the full release of this masterpiece. Thank you, Larian Studios!  UPDATE: With the full release of the game, I am extremely excited to keep playing. Starting an undead elf character was the first thing I did. I am almost done with Act 1 at the moment and have discovered so many quests, characters and items I previously had no idea about. There are so many things to do and many quests to complete. The cinematics and introductions are a nice touch."

jenn_geoffroy,182,2,0,October 2,Recommended,245.1,"I play RPGs for the story. I play strategy games for the tactical puzzles. In RPGs, the combat is (at best) an okay distraction between story points, and if there's a role-playing way to avoid a fight, I'll usually take it. In strategy games, the story is a thin trope-ridden veneer I mostly ignore.  Then along comes the DOS games. The only RPGs with a story I really really WANT to finish, alongside fights I will make a detour to take on. I'll still avoid fights with persuasion and roleplaying when I can, because I like the immersion and playing a clever character, but in DOS2, I'll loop back after obtaining my objective, plant as many barrels of oil and ooze I can find next to the enemy I conned into letting me run around, and then light them up like a roman candle before taking them down.  There's some good funny moments. Some gory creepy moments. Some really really hard moments (yikes, the crucial reveal in Lohse's story GUTTED me - it even gutted the hard-case who was guiding me on that quest, that's saying something as to how heartwrenching a choice needs to be made). And there's moments when you finally kill someone who's been irritating you for awhile by turning him into a chicken before giving him a final whack and shouting IN YOUR FACE as he explodes or something. Ahhh, good times, good times....  (Edited to remove potential light spoiler from Lohse's quest, never know...)"

This game is about as close to DND on a digital medium that you can get while still being its own game. Fully interactive environment, (tons of fire, electricuting water, exploding oil and poison) and the developers really played with it.  Just a small spoiler alert, but to just put it in perspective how the environment comes into play. There's one fight pretty far into the game on top of a mountain of wreckage. Out of absolutely nowhere, tons of oily blobs come to kill you. Every time you damage them, and they move, they spread oil. So the whole time, you're trying to batter them down as you move up the mountain to get away from them. The dev's then have it to where when the oily guys finally go down, TONS of fire guys show up and ignite all the oil. I know its kinda hard to get it across, but fighting ontop of this giant mound with fire everywhere trying to batter down the fiery slimes, seriously felt cool.   Character creation wise, I mean it's pretty good. Not a ton of customization, just standard face 1, 2, 3, etc. But honestly not a big deal. As you develop what your character is good at, you grow to love em.  Classes are pointless, you build your character the way YOU want to, so they can literally become anything. I've got a few characters going, and all feel super unique and diverse. A dwarven rogue shapeshifter who can grow a tentacle arm and smack people around as well as shed all enemies magical resistances to support, I've got a fire slinging geomancer who uses oil♥♥♥♥♥♥to explode just about everyone, and I've got a necromancer archer who summons tons of undead corpses to explode all over people. It all feels super unique and fun to play. There's times where I miss my other characters, hop on them to play, and then miss the one I was just playing. Kinda neat.  If you want my advice, 100+ hours advice, PLAY WITH FRIENDS. Preferrably in person. Hit up an old school lan party feel, bring cpu's over, build a SUPER diverse cast of characters, and hunker down. Pizza and beer obviously. Plan for an all nighter, because I literally PROMISE you you'll be playing til 6am EASY. I haven't personally had a game grab me like that in many years, and god damn its a good feeling to have back. Go larian, you guys are the men and women making games great again.  10/10."

Greendetective,47,2,0,"April 30, 2017",Recommended,127.9,I was very skeptical about this game.  How can a top down SRPG not be boring?  But after some persuasion from a friend i finally decided to buy it and play it with them and lo' and behold i was astounded by how fun this game is.  The puzzles and battles are the most strategic and amazing srpg battles I seen with environmental destruction being an awesome gimmick. The story is simple yet effective with a huge world with plenty to do and graphics are amazingly beutiful.  I was never bored playing it.  It will be amazing to see this game get finished and voice acting added(which is in the orginal Divinity).  But for an early access it does give you a good taste of the game and you can tell the finished product will be great.
Moogie,171,2,0,"September 25, 2017",Recommended,97.9,"Loved the first game, despite its flaws. I feel like this game fixes every issue the first game had and across the board improves on it - my hat off to Larian Studios for listening to feedback.   While the story and setting is darker, there is so much humor sprinkled into this game. With the addition of voice acting, I find myself listening to everything. I didn't know how to feel about the narration at first, but it has grown on me and I feel like it's a great addition to the game. The Origin stories are a neat touch, I am doing my first playthrough as Lohse and I feel like mine is the most interesting of the group. Definitely want to try Fane next.  Overall, its a beautiful game with great little details hidden everywhere. (Also the music is great)  I have a hard time coming up with any real criticisms of the game, but I will try. I wish there was a better loot system - i play ranged and I just never get to loot anything, which isn't very fun. Some of the quests I've run into were bugged, so that's a bummer but I'm sure they'll be fixed in the near future and I can do them on my Tactician playthrough. I feel like playing with 4 people pulls the game into too many directions, I miss stuff that other people are doing and everyone wants to have the feeling of exploration - that's not really a game flaw, I just think it'd be a better experience with 1-2 players."
Jentleman Jack,39,2,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,63.2," This game was just godly, the choices, the dialogue, exploration and combat.  The story, or stories more like, was truly engaging as was building a connection with the characters.  And with the choices to create my own, I did just that, an avatar to interact with the world set together by the true gods.  I quite enjoy the presence of sophisticated types regardless of how rude they may be, along with my affinity for lizard-like races, chose to be a blue ocean in the form of a lithe lizard, who with a mixture of bow and magic, controlled my enemies, and aided my allies.  On my journy was my three companions who have more than proved their friendship.   To begin was the vocals of the group, Lohse who with her mastery of summoning, most disconcerning interest in electrocution along with her words of encouragement(and madness) made for a friend worth staying in the back with and babying the rough'n'tough boys when they've had too much of a spanking.   Then theres the Beast who, in-spite of being quite short, excelled at movement, cutting down enemies as quickly as knocking them onto their♥♥♥♥♥ and with being a dwarf and a pirate no less, was enthusiastic, joyous and free as a dwarven pirate should be, whilst Lohse was the voice to the song, the Beast would always be the first to sing along.   And last, but definitely no least was the understandably arrogant Red Prince, tamer of flames, a true beefcake to my slender form, and as brutal with the shield as he is with his sword.  And somewhere along the lines his ""Fire"" met my ""Water"" and together created steam if you know what I mean, sure he was destined to another, but this here was the closest thing to true love.  Hm, but how far exactly did that ""love"" go, if you catch my meaning, meh, a fan-fiction to keep to my own.   But the hardest part about all of this, the story, your companions, was saying goodbye in the end, to say, this is it.  To end the journey and part ways with those of which you have made it so far with was quite heart wrenching.  I almost didn't want to say goodbye, but a story has to end.  For me, I would have wanted to keep playing after the epilogue, to be a god and explore the world as a one-lizard band.  Maybe even return to the Ancient Empire, see how everything fares with the Red Prince, share a few drinks, and reminisce upon our old adventures.  Perhaps we even get the whole gang together for another adventure, just like good old times.  But to say goodbye, to say goodbye was so hard, to part ways with friends, those who have been together with you through so much, is always hard, and sometimes, imagination alone isn't enough to mend the emptiness filled by adventures, especially ones with those you have melded with.    I guess this is more a tale rather than an actual review, or perhaps it is a review in the shape of a tale but even with the very small flaws in this diamond, I shall cherish this game for what it accomplishes.  A good story, a world full of surprises and secrets, and a band of friends I would forever play god with til' the end.  But I demand nothing more from Larian studios for they have made their sacrifices to deliver something no triple A game developer could get quite right.  I shall see to it that I myself create new adventures, because with the tools Larian has provided, we can all become story tellers, and we can all be pathfinders for our own adventures. -10/10 ...Would definitely adventure again."

pinkpinnn,248,2,0,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,122.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 - 2017 GEM.  Finding a game that mixes RPG, D&D, customizable class/ characters, good story telling, beautiful aesthetics, crafting system, tactical turn based battle, and option to play co-op? This game pretty much offers it all up on a silver plate.  I've played the first Divinity Original Sin, and my impression of that wasn't so strong, however I decided to give this a try, and it definitely floored me.  None too many games I've played have done a swell job in buffing lores, stories, and open ended quests for you to explore. You don't have to be a lore-lover or a rouge type gamer to enjoy this. There's a sweet spot for everyone. I went looking for a plain old adventure-with-consequences game, and spent more time reading up short lores here and there instead of speeding through it.  I can't believe I've spent 80+ hours (solo play) and still haven't completed it yet. Actually for the first chapter, I managed to spend 8-9 hours (and this was just purely exploring and figuring out quests). Halfway through the game, it even conjured up my nostalgia for Dragon Age 1.   CONS/ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  -Sometimes there are NO warnings before huge consequences take place. And when it happens, it's too late to alter (unless you are bothered to load up a game save 1 hour ago+). This happened a few times for me, the most painful one for me being: I couldn't take my companions to the next chapter because I'd missed that one window to convince them. They were absolutely gone. I loaded a previous save, but ever since that happened, I ended up tracking quests on wikia instead in fear of a major slip up -Quest journals are sometimes vague, and you will be left wondering or wiki-ing what the next step should be -Some quests feel un-finished or un-polished, as there may only be ONE, OBSCURE way of completing it -Not a must, but nice to have: Camera angle needs more rotation flexibility -No option to hide the HUD  PROS:  -The battle system constantly makes you look for the best spots to prepare and engage. Whenever you think you've got your ""go-to"" strategies nailed down, the game manages to switch it up just a little to make it challenging (+fun) again -Attention to detail towards the environment and the overall atmosphere. I don't always stop and look at the shadows of leaves and trees in a game. Each chapter is a map with it's own characteristics -Memorable background sound and music <3 Well done Borislav Slavov  -EVERY character has a voice! And voice acting is just ace -Main companions have decent back stories, although 1 or 2 still seem like pompous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s after 20 hours -HIGH replayability value -Co-op offers extra fun if you want play with you rmates, and most things work smoothly. Just take note of the connectivity menu, and make sure to set your game privacy, as random people can enter your game and hijack your acharacter completely. -Dungeon master mode! For those who are into D&D this might be an interesting mode to check out  TO THINK THIS GAME WAS BACKED BY A KICK STARTER AND DEVELOPED + LAUNCHED UNDER 3 YEARS!  It's not easy balancing and taking in multiple opinions and ideas and delivering on something this decent. I suspect good team work somewhere in Larian Studios. The game is decent enough for me to overlook the annoying flaws (for now). And major game developing companies? You guys better brush up your A game. Top notch graphics aren't the only thing that makes a game immersive and great.  ANYWAYS...JUST...Just ..go play it!"

briancourt2,105,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,168.1,"Was hesitant becasue of the turn based combat.  But thought hey XCOM was ""turn based"" just the like. This game is really well done.  Sure one might actually have to read a few things, but if you like some elements of old RPG games with todays world of graphics, this is an awesome game.  The choices are well thought through, with many options available based on who is simply talking.  It is not a click anywhere type of choice, as you don't get to go back and chose the right path after failing the 3 bad choices.  In that regard the game pace is slowed down. Battles take time to rethink and strategize.   Sometimes you just are not ready, and you need to find better equipment.  The combat systems is pretty much about putting out more damage than the other team can heal and deliver back.  If you ventured into a higher level, there is a good chance you will simly die.  That challange makes it hard to figure out, if you have not found the right strategy or if you need to wait.  Great game.  Well done.

Deathhydrax,22,2,0,"September 20, 2017",Recommended,421.6,"So im 18 hours into the game so far. Running two campaigns, one solo and one with a buddy of mine. I'm a huge fan of Dungeons and Dragons, I have a group that plays every week, and for the days when I'm not playing, this is the game that will scratch that itch.  There is so much to say about the game even in the small amount I've played, but the long and the short of it is that the sheer amount of choice it gives you is incredible. Already between my two campaigns I've seen large changes between interactions with characters, different quests, and different class combos. I'm very excited to see everything this game has to offer.  And as a final point, I can't believe that this is an Indie game. In my opinion, this is as entertaining as almost any triple A I've played in the last fair while. I believe anyone who enjoys the fantasty/adventure/D&D genre will enjoy this game, absolutely worth the buy!"
Ihnspyre,193,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,23.3,"This is a cRPG done right:  -  awesome graphics -  fantastic combat and background mechanics -  a lot of freedom -  nice voice acting -  very nice soundtrack  The game is a must buy, Larian did almost everything right in the production department, they listened to critics from the first game, they responded positively to suggestions from fans and worked a lot to improve their game.   This game is exactly that, a very WELL MADE cRPG BUT it lacks a few things that some cRPG fans love about the genre.   Firstly, nothing you see in this game is especially interesting from an artistic point of view. The maps are quite big and full of quests and things to do but there aren't too many WAH moments where you can just admire the artistic design of the map. They are mostly FUNCTIONAL and full of content but uninteresting. While games like Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity have awesome dungeon designs, awesome towns (Twin Elms etc.) and fantastic visual landscapes, D:OS 2 has classic maps with meh design and a lot of secrets.   Most of the game has a lighthearted style of writing, classic personalities for characters, kind of boring lore and story. There aren't too many memorable moments throughout the game (I got very close to the end of the game before getting bored of it on another shared account, bought it for Larian deserved support and future updates + multiplayer) and it really does nothing special except for the combat and mechanics (which are great!). The thing is that we are used to cRPGs full of bugs or questionable developer attitude and when an RPG like D:OS 2 comes out, without a lot of bugs, with a lot of content and fantastic gameplay, well, we tend to overrate it.   The humour was okay, not good and not bad. The party dynamics is not as good as Pillars of Eternity and that cRPG is more suitable for my taste (with complex lore and story, a lot of party interaction, fantastic artistic design and soundtrack).   Overall, Larian deserve a lot of support for being awesome hardworking devs but not for imagination, originality or artistic skills."
Mokona,31,2,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,22.7,"This review is just based on my first impressions of the game. Its worth getting.  There is an insane amount of skills and combos you can do that a single play through will never allow you to see all the cool stuff you can do so the replay value is high. My favorite thing I've discovered in the game is the way recruiting followers works. First you must convince them to follow you to begin with, they dont just come along because you are the ""chosen one"" or some crap. To boot if you like a character you dont have to worry about him being a mage when you are already a mage because each character asks you what you want them to be. No longer are you forced to not take your favorite npc with you or forced to play a class you dont like just to take it with you. You can finally have a balanced party full of npc you find interesting hurrah.  The only thing I would ""complain"" about is the lack of non human races. You got human, dwarf (small human), elf (vegetarian human), and lizard man (finally its not a human). Skeleton variations of all is nice to throw in but I honestly am just done with every fantacy game haveing there races be the 3 over used races, human, elf, dwarf, and then a final race being there own ""custom"" race that just turn out to be another human but blue or something like that. Glad we got lizard men but wish we had a few more.  This game has a lot of thought put into it and it somehow didn't lauch at the $60 price point, with mod support. I expected this to be as dissapointing as pillars of eternity was but just jumping into the character creation and I was already loving the game."

Andy Dwyer,656,2,0,"November 9, 2017",Recommended,74.5,"Probably the longest review I have ever written or will ever write, unless Original Sin 3 comes soon, SO, TL:DR; This has become my favorite game of all time. It's the best CRPG I've played since the old school ones, and then adds more mechanics and better story telling.   Pros: -Elemental Interactions -Companions so good I had a hard time picking who to bring in my party -Fun combat and mechanics -Excellent puzzle design for Acts I and II, and just really really good puzzle design in Act III.  -Compelling storyline, that ties in neatly with the other Divinity games, without requiring you to play them (though you should) -No microtransactions, season pass, loot boxes, etc.  -Able to respec your character as much as you want -Excellent skill management system -Excellent crafting systems -Excellent visuals in regard to spell effects and great art design -Excellent RPG elements, relative to character creation, talents, skills and tags -The music is off the charts for the most part -Great voice acting and sound design -Choices that actually matter during the story and change the story -Oddly descriptive ""intamacy"" scenes if you romance a character (is that a pro, maybe, it was well written) -Difficult enought that I was challenged and died plenty on the second highest difficulty, but never felt frustrated enough to quit or scum the game -Excellent game, because there's no other word I can use to describe it.   Cons: -Had a crashing issue during a few of the cut scenes between Acts -Music repeats a lot if you're repeatedly getting in and out of combat -Items like arrows and grenades get auto added to your hot bar, and I constantly had to clean it out for skills to be in the order I want, playing as a polymorph character I had a lot of skills appearing and disappearing between combat  Overall, you should play this game if you like turn based CRPGs, RPGs in general, turn based games, good games or even if you just want to support a great indie game dev. It reminded me of Dark Souls 1, where when I finished my first playthrough, I instantly made a new character, and started to play again with a completely different play style.  Update: you should also nominate and vote for this game whenever possible, so it can get some well deserved praise."

The origin characters all have interesting stories and it's fun to reveal them. I also liked the main story more than the one from D:OS. Graphics are fine, the soundtrack is great.   The round based combat sometimes requires patience, especially with larger groups and enemies who are able to charm or cripple your characters. But it works. There are still some bugs which hopefully will be fixed over time."

Morr-gan,334,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,116.6,"The game's start is an extremely, extreeeemely steep learning curve.  you essentially start off with no armour, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapons, and will be placed against enemies that could 1v1 you and win without breaking a sweat.   Even Dark Souls gives you an easier time starting off than this, trust me.  I recommend playing an Origin character before playing as custom, to get your first experience with a unique character, as the different characters have their own personal questlines and dialogue, which is interesting.  Combat is amazing as ever, however the initiative system has changed from the first one, instead whoever simply has the highest will start (or if it's a scripted boss/enemy to go first), then it will alternate between friend/foe/friend/foe.  Magic Armour and Physical Armour are interesting and basically grants you guranteed immuntie to certain status effects, like Stunned, Knocked down and bleeding unless said armour is reduced to 0. has it's drawback as it means if you dont have the perserverence attribute levelled some you'll get stunlocked in unfortunate positions by mages.  Lots of gametime for the story, with even double if you don't skip all the dialogue and pay attention to side quests (which I didn't).  overall 9/10 some bugs, but overall game is fantastic with a great story."

dep,81,2,0,August 29,Recommended,192.0,"Pros: Great look about the game, an old school isometric style but fully realised in 3D. The amount of detail is crazy, the main maps are large and crammed with objects and details. The sound is excellent and immersive, I’d guess 95% of dialogue is voiced, the soundtrack is good and sits well in the background. The gameplay is excellent once you know how to play (see cons) and really lets you go wild with combos between your party, using and abusing the environment, and manipulating your enemies. There is a huge variety of ways to play your characters, all without rigid roles or classes, allowing you create something like a Death Knight from warrior and necromancer skills, or Ranger with bow skills and summoning skills. A massive amount of mods to make the game easier or harder or just different. Cons: There is a very steep learning curve. If you don't know, and I mean really know, what you are doing the game can seem like it's just out to annoy you. It's not (mostly), but because of the nature of the combat system the game can swing between impossible and barely a challenge without too much middle ground. The levels can be quite arbitrary in where you can go. The second island for example ranges between level 9 and 15, and you can quite easily wonder into a fight you just have no chance of winning at that time. As the game does it’s best not to hold your hand, don’t expect much help from the quests. The massive array of options in playing your character also gives you many more ways to mess up. It might seem like a good idea to make a necromancer tank but you won’t do enough damage to heal yourself enough, better off going full offensive. If you don’t mind learning the hard way, not just reloading but restarting after you’ve wasted all your money on spells that don’t work together, then you will love this RPG. Otherwise at least get a guide for character creation and have some fun. "

Kipacus,31,2,0,"November 12, 2017",Recommended,98.2,This game gave me and my friends that old school Dungeon and Dragons Feel.  It gave me about 55 hours of gameplay if you take your time and enjoy the side quests and all of the content the creators added for you.  Clearly they listened to what the people wanted and gave it to us.  You have the freedom to build the charactor how ever you want.  I can not reccomend this game enough.  The game had a major bug when I first bought it thats now resolved (If you were player 2 and a summoner your spells would vanish and your summon wouldnt have their abilities only auto attack).  But like I said that was already resolved.  The game in its current state I give a 9/10.

The graphics are amazing, it runs pretty well with a high framerate on a typical PC...  Wouldn't ever regret this purchase."
Magus,267,2,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,236.5,"The game is awesome. The roleplaying opportunities are endless. A skeleton playthrough on tactician is not recommended for you first run. People attack the undead for some reason, don't know why. The origin characters are well written and makes the story more personal, especially seeing as you can decide to play the character however you wish.   Protip: Don't install mods until the game is ""finished"", steam forces you to update the game so that is likely to break mods. If that is a concern you might want to get the game on GoG instead for the control it offers."

Graphic (despite the clunky character potraits) and sound are excellent and detailled.   Future rpgs have let themselves to be measured on what Larian Studios achieved here.   The last ~50% of the game (act3-5) sure seem a bit rushed. The magic of the first 2 acts is not entirely gone but fades until the game becomes from time to time slightly annoying in act 5.   Still one of the best ""classical"" rpgs I ever played.   And please change the either groupwide magic dmg or physical dmg concept. On higher difficulties it makes no sense to go with a mixed group. One form of armor should be enough."

Gary Ginderhal,188,2,0,"May 14, 2017",Recommended,71.8,"Fantastic gameplay, even in an alpha state. That's the short of it, the long of it is a little more complicated.  This game's got a lot to offer even in an extremely unfinished state as it is, and I'll probably change my review when the next story segment comes out and likely again when the game's released as a finished product. As it stands, without voices, with missing dialogue, with missing assets, and occasional bugs, this is still a beautiful game that, while short, offers some pretty in-depth character customization, even up to level 8 or 9.   The elemental effect/terrain altering magic from the first game is back, and better than ever, with a few new combinations, as well as the Bless/Curse quasi-elements that can transform an already dangerous fire patch into a lethal Cursed Flame that sets enemies or allies aflame with immolation that can't be put out with water, or transform an annoying but avoidable oil patch into Blessed Oil that fortifies allies instead of slowing them, making it a detour you WANT to walk through for a buff rather than a hindrance to walk around. I constantly found myself wondering how best to use my action points to turn terrain to my advantage rather than simply cluttering up the field with dangerous patches of fire, ooze, or electrified water.  Creating characters is even more in-depth than the last game, and many of the old skills from the first game have either been changed or removed for more interesting ones. Summoning is now its own skill tree, and is best paired with spells that create environmental effects, or simply on a Lizard who can breathe a patch of flame wherever they want, as the summons, a totem and an ""Incarnate"" gain the element they're conjured on, either water, fire, poison, oil, or blood. Even with all the spells at my disposal, I still found myself favoring the weapons I'd chosen before, as even with a hundred spells at my disposal, sometimes it's nice to just smack someone with a big sword.  This game can be very, VERY hard, but often in a Dark Souls way. Usually you'll know why you died, and can reload to try to fix it next time. Enemy casting a lot of fire spells? Make sure to purchase a rain scroll or use more water magic to counteract them, or simply stunlock the enemy to death and try to pick apart the enemy's strategy. It's pretty rare that you'll encounter a fight that you simply cannot win when you first encounter it, unless you go into the battle extremely underleveled (If you're more than 1 level below your opponent, you're probably going to lose). Generally fights last a while, so make sure to prepare for both long and short combats as it's rare that you'll go into a fight completely outclassing your opponent, and be prepared to burn potions and the like, as they WILL give you an edge in combat and it's generally not worth trying to tough it out without them. There's apparently an entire mechanic for food, but I've never gotten good results from it and the buffs generally arent worth the action points it takes to eat it, so you can't simply down six cheese wheels to heal to full.  The storyline's not quite as good as the gameplay, sadly, but I'm pretty confident that with voice acting and some tweaks it will get far stronger. The quest journal's still hardly worth looking at unless you've totally forgotten what you've done and feel like looking through a complicated and user-unfriendly transcript of everyone you've ever spoken to. The journal could definitely use a change as it was often hard to maintain who's quests were what and with four characters with FOUR SEPARATE JOURNALS THAT OFTEN HAVE SEPARATE QUESTS it's quite difficult to keep everything straight. Thankfully it's easy to just start walking in a direction and you'll probably run into some enemies that are either your level or much, much higher, leading to a quick-reload and a different path taken. The storyline itself introduces a number of people, Dalis the Hammer, Bishop Alexandar, a blind elven seer, and far, far, FAR more, each with a complex backstory that almost everyone's happy to narrate to you at the drop of a hat, which can get a little overwhelming sometimes, but it's an inherently wordy RPG, so that's just par for the course.  The story's tone is classic Larian, with a serious and epic plot that tries to be grim and po-faced when the rest of the world is made up of goofy talking skulls, riddling rats, mad witches, puns, and adorable dog quest-givers. Although the main storyline ends up looking a little out-of-place, it's nice that it's there and that the game's not simply a permanent comedy routine. I will say that some will find the tone kind of schizophrenic, and although I'd agree with that I'd also say that it's not a game to be taken seriously, and is instead more a sandbox for one or more players can wreak havoc or play within the rules.  Character customization is a little lacking at the moment, but that's almost secondary compared to the great animations each race/gender has, as well as each armor set looking different on each race, with an emphasis on eastern cloth for Lizards, or a hardier iron look for Dwarves. Spells have intricate and impressive effects, even for basic spells such as ""Throw a rock"" or ""hit someone extra hard."" While the hairdos and facial options presented to each race and gender is pretty small, it's generally enough that you probably won't get your characters confused.  On an entirely different note, the game's graphics and representation is amazing. I love the vibrant colors, and beautiful tropical locale for the start of the game. The one big downside is that the first part of the game takes place in a giant prison, but the atmosphere is that of a tropical resort, with sunny skies, beautiful coral beaches, and a shanty-town that looks more like a run-down tourist town than a brutal gulag for wizards. Although it wouldn't be nearly as pretty to look at, it would have been nice to have a more oppressive environment to start in, and escape to the tropical paradise later on, for contrast. That being said, the shadow effects playing off trees and logs, and the drop dead gorgeous beaches make for an impressive opening, and when the future chapters of the game are released, I'll be most excited to see the environments they take place in.  To sum it all up, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic. Worth a look if you enjoy slower-paced RPGs, even though the storyline's only about 1/3rd complete. With almost all of its flaws coming from being an unfinished alpha and very few coming from the actual design or gameplay. Pretty much fun in every aspect, with an insane level of combat and character customization depth, this game is absolutely worth your time."

I've got to say that this game is one of the best for its price range, there's so much content in this game its crazy and its all voice acted :DD. Larian studio's really out did themselves with this game, if I had completed every single possible side quest/content before the main story finishes we are looking into 150hours plus (on honour mode which I play) or 100 hours plus on any other difficulty whilst reading dialogue etc.. This game is best played with friends as the character interactions/dialogue is top notch and provide really fun role playing. However I played by myself as I wanted to get immersed and finish the game on the hardest difficulty due feelings of it being rushed if I played with more people.   it took me 52 hours to complete the game doing story mission only with 1 origin character story (Lohse completed) as well as critical side quests that are blocking my way to the main quest. I'm also playing on Honour Mode difficulty(if your whole party dies you save is wiped), basically I have to play very safe ( I died quarter way in the game, salty af).   This game is worth every penny and its price tag just beats some of AAA games on global top sellers on steam for content/replayability to price ratio.  I'm hoping for a Divinity: Original Sin 3 :DDDD, I loved the story in this :DDDD  Edited : I'm gonna head back into this game and finish all side quests as well as explore."

I_Rock_Fiction,23,2,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,214.9,"Student Game Designer : Focus in UI/UX (Overall) 10/10     This is Hands down the best Turn based RPG i have ever played. Numerous improvements have been made since the last game (Divinity Original Sin). The Textures and animations are amazing. Also There seems to be a much more deep combo system compared to the last game which will make for some fantastic experamentation. Combat is still very interesting with most encounters resulting in different choices by the Enemy AI which ""spices"" up engagments.   Pros   The Characters and Dialoge are of course very good, with all of the origin characters having interesting backgrounds. your choices are questioned by your party memebers and many of them have different veiws, as they should.  The Skills and combos are fantastic and really fun to use although you will need to remember that your combos can be exploited or even used agaisnt you by the enemy Ai.  Armor and weapons look great and there seems to be a wide variety of different skins for each type of weapon.  While i did not explore the crafting system as much as i should have its pretty much the same as the last game. Although there are supposed to be way more (items etc) that we can craft.  The sound affects and the soundtrack are just as catchy and cool as last time. (GIVE ME THE SOUNDTRACK)  Cons.   Some enemy types have almost unfair adavantages against a party of any compsition, namley the undead and or necromancers/witches. Undead/ dark magic users, can both heal from poison and blood, as well as regular healing spells, which really just makes the battle alot longer than it needs to be. Ive never been a fan of undead being able to use the Hydro Healing spells. They should benfit from blood/poison fields/ spells only.  The Ui Still needs a bit of improvement as the item management system is still not that great. But is ok. It is very simplistic/minimalistic which is fine but we will need access to a universal chest of some sort to store our materials and such in. Or multiple backpacks will need to be equipped to carry most of your loot /items. Rather than turning one character into a pack mule or having lots of items spread out around multiple characters.      "

Ananoriel,336,2,0,"November 10, 2017",Recommended,76.9,"After 77 hours I finished Divinity Original Sin 2, and it was a blast! Most modern games don't grab my attention that long anymore, but this is one of the few that really keeps on being interesting and enjoyable.   Divinity OS 2 is a cartoonylooking RPG with turnbased elements. You have a big world to explore with your main character and 3 companions. You can build your characters in any way you want, with different talents, skills and stats. And it is fun to try out different party compositions. I ended up with having one ranger, one necromancer/scoundrel, one mage and one polymorph fighter. And there are many other ways to build your party, fitting to your playstyle.  The combat is the thing the game is most appraised about. It is turn based, and you can manipulate the battleground with surfaces from skills or items. And combining them in more powerful effects. For example you can throw oil on the floor to set it on fire. Or you can let it rain, and freeze enemies to death! It has many options and the combat has because of this many different outcomes, multiple techniques are possible. If you find the combat too easy or too hard, you can change the difficulty as well. I played most time on Classic mode, I found that the best balance for me to enjoy the game.  Another good thing about the game is the story, and the quests. You can get quests by talking to NPCs or exploring, and those are stored in your journal. You won't get exact questpointers, but with a little story that enfolds when you do more talking, exploring or fighting. For some people that would be a downside, but I really miss that in games, that you have to play the game more to find it out instead of running to a pointer and doing what is needed. The story is filled with intriguing characters, a nice pace and many plottwists to keep you awake. The NPCs make the gameworld interesting and feel alive. You can in some situations persuade them with skillchecks, and what you say to them may have an influence on how much they will help you or perhaps make your day bad if you fail. I feel like the humor in this game is a lot more subtle and less forced than in the first Original Sin game. It makes me feel to explore the world more and talk to NPCs. And the best thing: EVERYTHING IS FULLY VOICED! Which makes the game feel so finished.  Even that the artstyle is more cartoony, it is still beautiful in it's way. It doesn't look cheap or outdated, and there are many beautiful environments to adventure in. The music is good as well, I didn't feel bored by it. And you can change the main instrument of the battle songs of the characters you are playing, which is a nice detail. Other positive points on the game are: The Multiplayer mode, you can play an own campaign with your friends, or you can enjoy the main storyline too. This is a fun addition, and you can make it even more interesting with mods from the Workshop. The crafting system is unmissable from RPGs as well, and it is in this game as well. You can use almost everything you find to make armour, potions, arrows, grenades, whatsoever by combining them. This is fun to do, but I do recommend to find and use recipes since there are so many options.   So there is a lot of praise from me as well. But are there any downsides? Well, one thing that bothered me quite a bit was that there were plenty of bugs (some even gamebreaking) in the game. They have fixed many at the start of the release, but the further you get in the game, the more bugs and glitches you will find. That is a shame because this game is so wonderful, and has so much potential.  Do I recommend this game? Yes I definitely do!

This is my first turn based RPG ive played and it had a slight learning curve at the start, but if you play alot of rpg games or mmorpg, youl soon get the hang of things. Ive been getting tired of competetive games which is what the market is saturated with nowadays, and this really hit the spot for me, since i was looking for something coop, storydriven and chill. Graphics are soft and very appealing, the music is great, and the amount of diferent ways to play this game is insane. Plus considering the custom storys you can make, this game is well worth your 45 bucks."

Butler,139,2,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,89.9,"Loved Divine Divinity, one of Larian's first RPGs back in the early 2000s. So I knew they had talent but, bizarrely, they've spent the last 15 years making very average games (with the first Original Sin being a possible exception).  But this is something else. They've nailed it. It feels like they've finally made the game they wanted to make all those years ago.  It's hard to list everything good about it, but the writing, the voice acting, the world building, the character development, the questing structure, the combat... it's all so effortlessly brilliant.   It makes other genre greats like Pillars of Eternity look extremely average. And, if it isn't already, I can see it becoming one of my favourite RPGs ever. "

Guru,337,2,0,April 18,Recommended,81.3,"This is a fantastic RPG. You don't need another review praising it; it has enough of that already. So instead I'm going to discuss a few of its truly major flaws.  The game's design conflicts with its storytelling. I believe the devs wanted to craft something with an 'old school' feeling of challenge, but they lacked the talent to find a way to accomplish this outside of ""give the enemy unfair advantages"". For example, the game really only has one trick up it's sleeve: the ambush. Do you enjoy having your party jumped by overwhelming numbers of difficult bad guys that weren't there a moment ago, and giving them the first turn? You better, because it's how every fight is going down. Every single one.  Sometimes, rarely, YOU get to ambush the enemy... but they sometimes still get the first turn. Why? F you, that's why.  Frequently, bosses and encounters are made difficult not through clever design or tactical necessity, but through raw brute force and numerical disadvantage. It's no fun drowning under misaligned action economy, and thus a lot of the game's most important fights are left feeling like a chore, rather than an exhilerating battle. Immersion dies a gurgling death as you're forced to reload time and again, or skip dialogue scenes because initiating dialogue robs you of a precious initiative you totally lose, otherwise. Your character is made out to be the most pathetic of rubes, bamboozeled and ambushed and jumped again and again and again, never aware of the trap that's sprung on them, even after it's been sprung 500 times or more.   Hell, sometimes, in an effort to get the drop on someone else, you'll use a skill, which will execute the battle sequence, but the skill won't ""count"", leaving you ad a disadvantage and wityh a skill on cooldown that never fired off. Shoddy.  The storytelling, characters, and presentation of this game are truly S-class, but the nuts and bolts of the design betray the dev team's inexperience. Somewhere in the mix of all the dazzling setpieces and clever dialogue and rich world design, they forgot to make the battles fun. They didn't have the time or inspiration to make the battles feel different from each other; instead, it's just a long slog of you're ambushed, you're ambushed, you're ambushed, you're ambushed...  I still reccommend this game, but if you're reading these reviews and wondering what you're walking into, I still say buyer beware. If you're the type of gamer that likes to save-scam and find cheesy strats to win fights, this is the game for you. If you enjoy a varied experience of battles and well-paced content, perhaps look elsewhere. This game is a vast improvement on the original, but it still feels as though the dev team came very close to what might have been the best RPG of all time, merely making one that is 'well above average'. A silver medal glitters just fine, but I think we would all hope for the gold next time."
Mr Engineer,77,2,0,October 30,Recommended,135.4,"Finally finished the game, so let's review:  Pros: Very in-depth RPG, there are a lot of opportunities to personalize your character and play style. Tactical turn based combat. Loads of interesting quests packed with different ways to complete them. Four player co-op! Even though my experience was exactly as chaotic as you may expect. Adding to the above point, you can do almost anything and fight anyone without breaking the game! Cons: Some bugs will make you wish you saved more often (ex. characters frozen in dialogue, armor buffs not applying anymore). Players can sometimes progress quests, even origin character personal quests or big story shifting moments, without input from other players. Were you the first guy in the room? Well, hope you have high persuasion and/or need to talk to the NPCs because your pals are out of luck! Decide for yourself: 80-100 hours of content for one playthrough! Most of the RNG elements from DOS1 have been stripped away for a more straight forward, if not always more rewarding, experience (ex. armor system to resist cc, character tags open up new dialogue options but don't provide any combat/civil buffs). Combat cheese, or abusing the system... I haven't encountered an impossible fight yet, but there are plenty that can be made a lot easier by adding some deathfog barrels, applying buffs while in dialogue before the fight, fleeing with one character to get full health before returning to the fight, etc. Ending spoiler  No matter how you played before, unless you swear to the god king or demon, you can choose any ending you want Mass Effect 3 style.  Overall, I would completely recommend this game. I even started another playthrough!"

queue for comp with me pls,229,27,8,"December 15, 2017",Recommended,74.8,"It's difficult to give this game either a straight thumbs up or thumbs down, since there's both good and bad about it. I ended up giving it a thumbs up because I still think it's worth playing even if it has some problems. Note that I'm a nerd when it comes to games, so there's a few technical bullet points that probably won't matter at all to most people.  The good:  Fantastic music  Strong story (at least until the end)  Turn-based combat was usually enjoyable, even if you're not the kind of person who usually enjoys it  Well-optimized (max settings @ 2560x1440, usually 2560x1440 60fps on Ryzen 5 1600X, GTX 970, 16GB ram)  Detailed graphical settings menu  Hardware mouse cursor  Ability to quicksave in the middle of dialogue, letting you explore all possible options The bad:  Probably my biggest gripe with the game is that it's split up into 4 islands, each with their own group of quests. Once you decide to progress to the next area, there's no way to go back to the previous area if you wanted to complete some unfinished quests later (besides loading up an older save, of course). You are very clearly warned that you won't be able to go back, I just have an issue with the design choice itself.   Quests can be pretty easily broken by doing them ""out of order"", without automatically skipping ahead or marking a quest as ""failed"" (kill a guy for quest A before you progressed enough in quest B where you were supposed to talk to him). There's no way to know the ""order"" to do quests in without looking on the wiki. Sometimes doing quests out of order resulted in the quest journal entry for them being completely blank.   Almost all quests create markers on the map, but they are usually left behind even after the quest is complete, or don't update along with quest progress. This leads to a world map that is full of markers, most of which are meaningless. Compounding this issue, there's no way to set an ""active"" quest (unless you count marking all but one quest inactive, kinda tedious).   A lot of quests (~35%) have non-obvious solutions or locations to visit that required me to look on the wiki for help (remember, unhelpful quest markers).   A significant number of quests (10-20%) don't actually get marked as ""complete"" when you finish them, which means they'll just stay in your journal as active quests   I'm usually not a fan of strategy/turn-based games. I admit to playing this game on the easiest difficulty and still finding it somewhat challenging. With that said, maybe I'm just an idiot, but I found some mechanics that were part of this game's combat to be extremely irritating, most notably the turn-skipping mechanics. If you ever let your characters lose all their magic armor, expect to have them focused hard by the AI. You'll likely have at least 2 of your characters' turns skipped per round. One particular fight I had ended with me watching my characters getting repeatedly frozen for several rounds, where all I could do was watch. Pretty frustrating.   In the same vein as the above bullet point, don't try to control the battlefield, or put out that fire you're standing in. It's completely irrelevant. Just focus on killing everyone first, then heal up your characters. If you waste time and action points blessing that cursed surface, the first thing an AI will do is curse it again.   Meh ending (subjectively)   Perhaps not technically a problem with the game itself, but Steam cloud chokes hard on this game. Sometimes quicksaves are all right, but other times it'll completely freeze the game for 30 seconds while Steam is doing god-knows-what. My fix was disabling Steam cloud and just having saves back up to OneDrive (the game saves to your documents folder). The irritating: (Things that weren't really problems with the game, just unpolished things that need a bit more love)  Using the mouse to rotate the camera by holding MOUSE3 is extremely stuttery and is relative only, so it will ""slip"" and won't rotate very far if you move your mouse quickly   Completed quests are marked as ""closed"" and are removed from the active quest list when you look at them one last time to read the ""i finished this quest"" flavor text. However, sometimes you will open the quest journal and the finished quest is already selected, and it'll show the ""i finished this quest"" flavor text for 1 frame before moving it to the archived quests section. I wanted to read that!   Book page turning effects are significantly misaligned It's a solid game with an intriguing story that's definitely worth playing, but it's a far cry from the best RPG ever. Skyrim did it better."

Cool thing is they are basically forcing certain race/sex on you (they have a lizard guy as a playable) to give your character a deeper back story for dialogue options.  Don't worry you can still customize their face/class etc.  Audio effects seem a little off, and the music is so far subpar compared to the original.  All of these things I expect to see be resolved in the next few months as the game becomes more polished and lives up to its predicessor.  Also on the beach there is a statue of Braccus Rex, which is pretty cool for emerssion.  Buy this game if you want to support the devs (which I do).  Waiting to give it a full or first act playthrough once they dialogue is more full rather than the way it is sort of asterisked as actionable atm, which is hard to read and play and get into imo.  Game has most of the old classes, plus a lot of new skills it seems.  I wanted to play a (halfing) monk, but it seems like they removed that class."

If you have not played the first, buy it before you buy this one.  Anyway, I will not go into the virtues of this game, but instead Ill go into some negatives.  I would give this game a thumbs down, except for the play time and fun I had.  There are just some major flaws with the game and I wish the developers would really address them.  Gripes: The UI is pretty bad.  The quest log is a mess and the inventory is worse.  Even a key chain would do wonders.  It would be really nice if any charater could bater and just use the highest batering of any character instead of forcing you to give everything to one character.  The same with other skills in other situations.  IE: Initatiting dialog with a character that doesn't have any persuasion skill.  The quests are down right mysterious in a lot of cases.  I frequently have to google on what to do on quests.  This is a bit too old school for me.   Also important information was frequently missing from the quest log and I had to either write it down or google it.  Things like the 7 gods sun/moon alignments are... or god X favoers earth and god y favors water,  and stuff like that.  I would like less puzzly quests and/or better hints.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t combats:  Most speical encounters involve the enemies getting a whole bunch of actions before you get any. As you get later in the game, the level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t rises higher and higher.  The final battle is a whole new level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t beyond anything you have encountered before.  Hint to the devs:  This kind of thing is not fun.  You really should have play tested the full game.  While bugs are one thing, balance is definitly something you messed up big time.  Don't even get me started on your respawning revrents.  Still though, this game is worth the money even though it has some serious flaws.  Please excuse the bad spelling and typoes.

Gilded,0,3,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,71.9,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a phenomenal experience anyone who is a classic RPG fan will love.   The overall appeal of Larian studios masterpiece is in its complex RPG systems, dynamic combat and world-changing character choices that synergize together to create an unforgettable experience. There is a ton of replayability because the world dynamically adapts to the choices you make. From the missions you decide to do or not, to the fights you start for no reason, this game really is yours to play however you would like.  They also have great controller support, a fantastic crafting system, a truely unique multiplayer experiance, complex weapon and armor mechanics and a wide range of skills and abilities to choose from. Not to mention the increasing number of mods already available from the community.  There are some downsides, like the inability to re-specialize early on (already fixed by mods) and the overall difficulty seems to be a little unbalanced. Every fight is difficult, requiring you to really think before you act.  Overall I would give Divinity: Original Sin 2 an 8.5 out of 10.

TheSilverHammer,491,3,0,"October 14, 2017",Recommended,307.2,"This is a great RPG.  If you liked the first you will really like the 2nd one.  If you have not played the first, buy it before you buy this one.  Anyway, I will not go into the virtues of this game, but instead Ill go into some negatives.  I would give this game a thumbs down, except for the play time and fun I had.  There are just some major flaws with the game and I wish the developers would really address them.  Gripes: The UI is pretty bad.  The quest log is a mess and the inventory is worse.  Even a key chain would do wonders.  It would be really nice if any charater could bater and just use the highest batering of any character instead of forcing you to give everything to one character.  The same with other skills in other situations.  IE: Initatiting dialog with a character that doesn't have any persuasion skill.  The quests are down right mysterious in a lot of cases.  I frequently have to google on what to do on quests.  This is a bit too old school for me.   Also important information was frequently missing from the quest log and I had to either write it down or google it.  Things like the 7 gods sun/moon alignments are... or god X favoers earth and god y favors water,  and stuff like that.  I would like less puzzly quests and/or better hints.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t combats:  Most speical encounters involve the enemies getting a whole bunch of actions before you get any. As you get later in the game, the level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t rises higher and higher.  The final battle is a whole new level of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t beyond anything you have encountered before.  Hint to the devs:  This kind of thing is not fun.  You really should have play tested the full game.  While bugs are one thing, balance is definitly something you messed up big time.  Don't even get me started on your respawning revrents.  Still though, this game is worth the money even though it has some serious flaws.  Please excuse the bad spelling and typoes. Its a bit late and I have had a considerable amount of wine.  I think I am seeign two of every character right now."

Happy Colored Marbles,256,3,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,32.0,"If you like RPGs at all I think you owe it to yourself to play this game. The world is filled with story and lore, lots of hidden things to keep you entertained. Plenty of fun and unique dialog that you'll find yourself wanting to experience and not just skip. In some ways the open ended nature of the game and the fact that it's totally willing to let you kill yourself as many times as it takes to teach you something reminds me of D&D. You're given tools and problems and set free to solve them and move through the story organically. The combat is turn based, deep and tactical.    You'll find yourself creating strategic synergies with your team and relish the creative ways you can defeat your enemies (funny deaths with teleport alone could keep me occupied for hours).  That said the game will punish you if you rush in with reckless abandon rather than carefull engaging. I recommend saving often :)  The game is a blast co-op if you don't mind waiting for your friends to take their turns, controller support is top notch, the  graphics are beautiful but not at all taxing for mid grade machines. This is a game crafted with a lot of care and polish and it deserves your time."

AlienSpectator,190,3,1,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,76.1,"A true piece of art, the best RPG I've played since Dragon Age: Origins.  I didn't play this game much yet, but I've been following its development, as I did for D:OS1. You've got everything you'd want from an RPG: good story, interesting universe and characters, tactical (and even one of the best I've seen!) combat system - varied skills to use and a lot of combos between different characters - true replayability. And fun multiplayer (even if I'd advise to play only with friends you can trust).  So I'm only going to focus on what you may actually not like much:  Set up. There's a lot of dialogues - they are rather good, and they are voiced. But there are many of them: if you're not too much into that, you'll miss a quarter of what the game has to offer, at least.     The game has a thing for silly stuff. Like in the previous opus, dialogues are very ""facetious"". It's a mix of jokes and serious stuff, you have to be prepared for absurd deaths and brutals happenings, but if you can't handle anything else than fashionable so-called ""dark fantasy"" you'll be disappointed. D:OS2 is colourful, baroque and lively, and also features cannibals and living deads, even if you can create ugly meat ball that explode on your enemies (and friends alike, thanks to friendly fire).     Character building. In DOS2, it's not a straightforward process. Sure, you can pick all deafult options and you shouldn't have too many problems - but if you don't enjoy doing things like selecting skills that go well together and/orcrafting, you'll also miss a good part of the game. It's not just about choice between different ""specialities"", it's really about elaborating strategies and enjoying battle plans. If you're ok with all this, you're likely to enjoy this game. You'll also need a lot of time, obviously, but the ""quest log"" is sufficiently well done to not lose you if you can't play a lot, and you don't need a lot of time to learn the game (everything is pretty intuitive, you don't need to spend hours on a wiki to know what does what or why you can't do X).   Would kickstart again."

GeoTrooper13,224,3,0,"October 8, 2017",Recommended,97.1," TLDR:  Put 100 hours into one playthrough.  A phenomenal RPG experience that is a breath of fresh air.  Even at full price this game is well worth it.  Some pros, neutrals and cons for some quick pointers.  My views and such will be included after but can be ignored if wished.   Pros: Only $45 which is a steal for the amount of content you get. Very lengthy game, 4 world areas with multiple quests in each of them. Servicable story, interesting but nothing mind blowing, same goes for the lore. Lots of side quests to do which can put you in some interesting situations. Very well written characters, this goes for followers and NPCs. Lots of dialogue and options for you to navigate conversations, and every line is voiced too! Very good, tactical, challenging combat.  Lots of ways to approach each encounter. Diversity in how to play characters.  No defined ""roles"" and its easy to completely change a character at any point after the first main area. The entire game is playable in co-op which can be drop in drop out.  Works with up to 4 players.  It even has split screen! Also comes with an Arena multiplayer mode for PvP and a Game Master mode to play D&D with friends.  Basically infinte replayability. Along with that as a bonus they included the Engine for Divinity as a free download.  You can make your own mods, maps, scripted dialogue, etc.  It even has native workshop support to easily upload to. Steam workshop support for easy access to mods.  Neutral: These neutral comments are going to be mostly preferencial for people.  Not a problem for me but I can see how it can be a problem for others. No handholding whatsoever.  Not really an issue for me and some may wonder why this here.  For some I can see an issue with some quests.  There were a few times where I wondered how the game thought I would have been able to figure out certain things.  If you get stuck just have the wiki open, I certainly used it a few times and it was very helpful. No handholding also extends to combat.  Combat can be really challenging at times, almost borderline unfair.  However once you learn all the mechanics of the game and learn how to be scummy it is really satisfying to beat a challenging fight. In my opinion there were a few quests that were poorly designed.  Kinda goes with the point of no handholding, a few of the ways to complete some quests were really convoluted.  Not that many of them which is why it's neutral and not a con.  Cons: Bugs, lots of them.  There are many quest bugs in this game which cause quests not to close out properly.  In my experience I would say there were around maybe 15 or so in total.  Kind of annoying when you fail a quest just because it gets bugged out.  Also the recorded dialogue cuts out randomly some times.  However Larian have been releasing patches so hopefully most of the bugs will all be ironed out eventually. Overall this game was phenomenal, loved almost all of my time with it.  At $45 which gave me about 100 hours on a single playthrough it was absolutely worth the money.  I was surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did since I don't really enjoy isometric RPGs with this kind of combat.  I tried Pillar's of Eternity and could never finish it.  Really it's the combat that prevents me from playing games like this.  However Divinity's combat is extremely well done and I enjoyed it when I learned the in's and out's.  This game is certainly not for everyone, for those that don't like challenging, slow, turn based combat this isn't for you.  If you don't like long winded, role-play driven, lore heavy dialogue and questing this game isn't for you.  If you don't like a lack of handholding in your quests this game isn't for you.  If you like all of the above or are looking for an amazing RPG that says ♥♥♥♥ all to modern tropes then I can say with certainty you'll enjoy Divinity: Original Sin 2.  Honestly at full price this game is worth it, on sale it's a must buy.  Hopefully more people will continue to buy this game and support Larian, they fully deserve it and I can't wait to see what they'll do next."

DarthDavy,293,3,5,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,129.7,"Disclaimer: the following text is totally unbiased and non sarcastic!  I have some gripes with the monetization of this game. It's clear that Larian hasn't enterend the realm of 2017 yet and DOS2 is really not up to par with todays standards: 1. DOS2 retails for 44.99US$ or your regional equivalent. A modern game with high production values, which DOS2 clearly has with its beautiful atmospheric graphics, its incredible well written story, an amazing voice acting performance, a grandiose orchestral soundtrack, dozens hours of content and deep tactical gameplay should retail for 59.99US$. 2. No pre order bonus. In the beginning of the game you meet a black cat with its own small storyline, but totally not essential to the grand story overall. DOS2 has tons of sidequests with their own story and those go further than the bland ""go fetch me 10 wolf pelts"" sidequests. Those sidequests make the game so much more engaging and rewarding to play. That black cat could be easily cut from the game and offered as a pre order bonus, which would be a good incentive for people to buy the game upfront without knowing if the game is any good. After launch you offer the black cat as a 9.99US$ DLC and make some more money out of it. 3. DOS2 comes with 6 origin stories, 6 unique characters, which greatly changes how you will experience your travels and adventures throughout Rivellon. This enhances the replayability of DOS2, but knowing this game is in one playthrough already al least 70 hours long this is perhaps a bit much to offer at a base price of 44.99US$, which really should be 59.99US$ (see point 1.). As you can take only 4 characters in your party, offering 4 origin stories in the base game is more than enough. You can easily cut two, say Beast (a Dwarven Pirate) and Fane (an Undead), and offer them in a Digital Deluxe Special Edition for an extra 20$: - Divinity Original Sin 2: Pirate Edition for 79.99US$ with Beast origin story - Divinity Original Sin 2: Undead Edition for 79.99US$ with Fane origin story And of course you bundle this all together in: - Divinity Original Sin 2: Gold Edition for 99.99US$ with all 6 origin stories 4. DOS2 doesn't have a season pass. Will Larian just patch and add extra content for free? 5. DOS2 makes you play and enjoy the game without cutting corners through microtransactions. If a character in your party dies, you must make sure you have a resurrection scroll to revive him/her or have enough gold to buy one from the NPC's in the game. There is no ingame store that let you buy ingame items or ingame gold for real money.  Despite these 5 points of criticism DOS2 is a fantastic game. It's one of the best cRPG's ever made and playing this game you feel you're playing something special. This truly is a classic: 10/10!"

Gilded,685,3,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,71.9,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a phenomenal experience anyone who is a classic RPG fan will love.   The overall appeal of Larian studios masterpiece is in its complex RPG systems, dynamic combat and world-changing character choices that synergize together to create an unforgettable experience. There is a ton of replayability because the world dynamically adapts to the choices you make. From the missions you decide to do or not, to the fights you start for no reason, this game really is yours to play however you would like.  They also have great controller support, a fantastic crafting system, a truely unique multiplayer experiance, complex weapon and armor mechanics and a wide range of skills and abilities to choose from. Not to mention the increasing number of mods already available from the community.  There are some downsides, like the inability to re-specialize early on (already fixed by mods) and the overall difficulty seems to be a little unbalanced. Every fight is difficult, requiring you to really think before you act.  Overall I would give Divinity: Original Sin 2 an 8.5 out of 10.

Lohkar3,120,3,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,246.5,"Gamer's game Most games these days are over after playing it ~30 hours, I was positively suprised that it was only the end of 1st act in the game and 2nd act seems to unfold even more content to explore and to beat.   The game has this bit of a typical rough beginning, where you are a prisoner and have to start working your way into freedom. I'm not sure does it help to introduce the gaming mechanics that well, since some of the first obstacles in the game require already hard exploration or knowledge of your surroundings. But I won't go too much into the game's internal story settings and themes on this one. Instead I'll just give quick look for those who are interested in the game, but find it hard to get started.  If you are a casual rpg player, this game is best to start in co-op with your friend on medium difficulty. The game is playable/enjoyable initially in single player as well, but you'll have to get used to manage alot with the inventory, skills and spells early on. One of the aspects that makes many lose the interest to these kinda games when playing alone. But those few well written NPC friends makes sure you'll get a feeling of unity and comradeship while you progress in the story. The game has also this welcoming feeling to those who haven't played the first game, without referencing it too much.  Combat is turn-based and it isn't around every corner, but when you find it though, it usually lasts slightly longer than in many other games. I remember one ambush encounter in a forest section took like 15 minutes active fighting, and that was after we came back to it with better equiptment. Dialogues and random banters are high also in this game, which all seems to be voice acted from the ""AI's"" side to give more lively touch to it. And you can example easily play 2 hours and all you did was few conversations.  The game also offers eventually challenge for more hardcore players, who would get bored if the game would be too easy. Hardest difficulty (Tactician) requires quite alot backtracking and unconventional tactics sometimes to overcome encounters with the builds you might have at disposal. And eventually if you're feeling confident enough you can try the real hardcore mode (Honour) where losing all your characters ends the game and removes your single save file.  I'll try to overlook some of the negative sides in overall since some can be patched later and some are build so deep in the game mechanics it is more of a ""depatable"" thing. Like personally I would like magic to be more meaningful and more costly to the caster, so it doesn't become a norm in the world for elements to go chaotic in every fight. But I guess it's something you can expect in a Divinity's world.  Nontheless this game is true to the older adventure/fantasy/rpg games, where you'll get minimal hand helding and have to figure things out by yourself. No-one is master in the beginning, but everyone can learn to fare better. Some events can be solved with pure violence or with smooth talking, the choice is often yours.  -Even if you'll never finish this game, it is worth a try.   9/10"

Stormfrenzy88,9,3,0,October 8,Recommended,113.6,This game is the ultimate cRPG. You can just feel the passion and dedication that has been put into this game. It’s the only one that actually innovates the genre while others are still stuck redoing the 90s. Don’t get me wrong - I used to love these games back in the day but 2D worlds and antiquated combat systems of infinity style games just feel dated by now and D:OS 2 really improves upon these main shortcoming of the genre.  The main strength of the game lies within its fantastic combat system. Turn-based is the absolute best fit for party based combat that allows for incredible depth. For every encounter there are multiple approaches to consider and the way abilities interact between each other and the environment is just awesome.  Another great thing about the game is how much player freedom it allows. A lot of quests have many different ways to solve them with various outcomes. Not reaching an ideal outcome in a quest will not hinder your progress but the story will just play out differently.   The visual and sound design is truly top notch and does a great job of getting you immersed in the game world. The fully 3D world with rotatable camera is a treat to explore.  It is designed with gameplay first approach and I absolutely love it but that said the story and characters are still fairly interesting and open up a plethora of moral questions that do not always have a clear cut right or wrong answer.   The game’s lack of hand-holding and signposting mostly feels like a breath of fresh air but can get a bit frustrating at times. Of course that’s only because the tendency in recent games to overdo it has conditioned us to think less for ourselves so overall I find the direction here to be positive.  The amount of content this game offers is certainly impressive and well worth the cost.  Overall I’d say that while there certainly is room for improvements Larian has done a good job making this masterpiece that has found a place among my most beloved games of all time. Therefore I would rate this game with a nearly perfect score of 9.5/10.

nakimesis-,148,3,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,135.3,"Game that tops the oh so beloved by world Witcher 3, hands down. I've been planing on postponing writing this review to the moment when I complete the game whole, but after realizing I got a pretty strong grasp on it, I figured there's no point in waiting and the time has come to add my own brick to the game pras wall.  If you feel disappointed by RPG games praised by the reviewers and gaming community lately (namely The Witcher 3 or latest Fallout installment) you should give this game a go - with captivating story, interesting characters, dynamic and tactical combat, and character development that actually feels rewarding and meaningful it reaches out for the title of turn-based RPG game of the dacade.  I've bought the game on official release, not having played the early access before, only the predecessor. And I got immediately sank in the world of Rivellon - realizing that I pumped as much as 40 hours in marely 10 days.  Thanks to the compelling gameplay, you get sticked to the screen, not wanting to leave - promising yourself every half an hour, that you only gonna get that last quest completed, that last cave explored, that last bad guy butchered. There aren't any meaningless quotation marks on your maps, which give you mundane quests of the ""here's the key, use it to open that chest 10 meters from you, to get your dull loot"" likes (*cough* I'm lookin at you, witcher*cough*), every character feels purposeful or interesting at least, with witty, funny and FULLY VOICED dialogues of highest quality, every location hides its secrets, leading you towards surprising outcomes, interconnected areas and such - simply exploring the world with no handholding and silly marks never felt so rewarding and enjoyable, holy heck.  Combat system really adds to it, with its fresh approach to the encounters - not only will you need to pay attention to the health bars, but also to the environment, as most spells will interact not only with another spells, but also with the puddles on the ground, the mist in the air, the fire eating your enemies' bodies. The fights are so satisfactional! If you are seasoned player, or turn-based RPGs veteran I definitely suggest you start your first blind new game on tactical difficulty - it's actually dificult, but also greatly amusing.  The story and quests are really good, a noticable jump forward since the first game. Not only NPCs you meet on your road, but also so-called ""origins"" characters are interesting. Each with his own story and mission to fulfill in the world of Rivellon - you really start to like your companions and grow bonds with them.   But not only your mates are accompanying you - there's a great soundtrack in this game, which breaths a captial ""A"" into your Adventures. New composer did an excellent job with creating the OST. He didn't fill the boots after Kirill Pokrovsky - and oh, we should not want him to! - he made something with his own vision, and may he be praised for this, as he did an amazing job on it.  Last, but not least - the game offers you a multiplayer experience with up to 4 players - while not necessary to experience the storry whole, it really adds a pinch of spice to the game. With its diverse combat you will definitely have a great deal of fun with your friends - so if there's an option, I highly recommend going for it.  For a word of closing this review - big shoutout to Larian, for delivering one of a kind game, and satisfying not only kickstarter backers needs, but also these of people who didn't track the game development process at all - and concurrent players counter is a prime example of that. Kudos!"

I got it on the first day of Early access and i had faith, and on Sept 14th my faith was rewarded. So here is my review for Divinty original sin II. You see there are a lot of people who does not like turn based RPG, while playing OS1, I recommened it to almost all of my friends and hardly anyone was intrested but OS2 was a different case . Impovement over the first one is huge (NOT THAT OS1 WAS BAD OR SOME I GAVE IT MUST BUY) : 6 Origin stories, and all of them are top notch. : If you dont need origin story you can craft your own character. : While the game was in EA I spent almost 30 hours and that was just the first act of the game. : After release I am almost on 70 hours and the game is no where near it's end. : Ok HUGE game so what about the quality of the game you say, well this game is  good as the witcher3 may be better in some case ( Witcher 3 is also on top of my list)       : Gameplay is Improverd and you dont feel like that the game is stopping you to do something.          You can do what ever you want and ir will have an effect on your game world       : There is no hand holding (most part), So if you killed some NPC for some reason and if he or          she had some quests for you, well say good bye to that one.       : Combat is complex and fun and huge number of new skills and metas are present in game        : True openworld in topdown RPG. You can decide how to complete a quest or how to attack,           how to respond to all the dialouges.       : And did I say all the scripts in the game are voice acted ( So you dont have to read everyting           like in Pillars of eternity, Tyrrany etc) .        : This game is also beautiful, Character models are good, Lighting and vfx on casting spells or            elemental effects all feels top notch.       : Music and audio FX are so dood you can listen to them all time ( Hell i listen to them on my           phone)       : Single player, 4player co op, 2 player split screen( Respect) , PVP Arena so what do you           need more       : All these things in just 996 INR (15USD) and no micro transaction bullcrap.  So This game is a must buy, Do not missout on this one. GOTY 2017 (May be).                                 Peace"

I am a RPG freak, loved the games of old such as Baldur's gate 1 and 2, fallout 1 and 2, Planescape, and more recently Pillars of Eternity and of course The Witcher 3. This game is a statement. A huge ""in your face"" statement that the classic top down RPG genre is far from dead, but instead can evolve to new height.  So why will I stop playing it? I dont want to finish it. This is exactly what happened to The Witcher 3. I cannot bring myself to finish it because I know after that, there will be no more.  I know... Weird. "
GeoTrooper13,224,3,0,"October 8, 2017",Recommended,97.1," TLDR:  Put 100 hours into one playthrough.  A phenomenal RPG experience that is a breath of fresh air.  Even at full price this game is well worth it.  Some pros, neutrals and cons for some quick pointers.  My views and such will be included after but can be ignored if wished.   Pros: Only $45 which is a steal for the amount of content you get. Very lengthy game, 4 world areas with multiple quests in each of them. Servicable story, interesting but nothing mind blowing, same goes for the lore. Lots of side quests to do which can put you in some interesting situations. Very well written characters, this goes for followers and NPCs. Lots of dialogue and options for you to navigate conversations, and every line is voiced too! Very good, tactical, challenging combat.  Lots of ways to approach each encounter. Diversity in how to play characters.  No defined ""roles"" and its easy to completely change a character at any point after the first main area. The entire game is playable in co-op which can be drop in drop out.  Works with up to 4 players.  It even has split screen! Also comes with an Arena multiplayer mode for PvP and a Game Master mode to play D&D with friends.  Basically infinte replayability. Along with that as a bonus they included the Engine for Divinity as a free download.  You can make your own mods, maps, scripted dialogue, etc.  It even has native workshop support to easily upload to. Steam workshop support for easy access to mods.  Neutral: These neutral comments are going to be mostly preferencial for people.  Not a problem for me but I can see how it can be a problem for others. No handholding whatsoever.  Not really an issue for me and some may wonder why this here.  For some I can see an issue with some quests.  There were a few times where I wondered how the game thought I would have been able to figure out certain things.  If you get stuck just have the wiki open, I certainly used it a few times and it was very helpful. No handholding also extends to combat.  Combat can be really challenging at times, almost borderline unfair.  However once you learn all the mechanics of the game and learn how to be scummy it is really satisfying to beat a challenging fight. In my opinion there were a few quests that were poorly designed.  Kinda goes with the point of no handholding, a few of the ways to complete some quests were really convoluted.  Not that many of them which is why it's neutral and not a con.  Cons: Bugs, lots of them.  There are many quest bugs in this game which cause quests not to close out properly.  In my experience I would say there were around maybe 15 or so in total.  Kind of annoying when you fail a quest just because it gets bugged out.  Also the recorded dialogue cuts out randomly some times.  However Larian have been releasing patches so hopefully most of the bugs will all be ironed out eventually. Overall this game was phenomenal, loved almost all of my time with it.  At $45 which gave me about 100 hours on a single playthrough it was absolutely worth the money.  I was surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did since I don't really enjoy isometric RPGs with this kind of combat.  I tried Pillar's of Eternity and could never finish it.  Really it's the combat that prevents me from playing games like this.  However Divinity's combat is extremely well done and I enjoyed it when I learned the in's and out's.  This game is certainly not for everyone, for those that don't like challenging, slow, turn based combat this isn't for you.  If you don't like long winded, role-play driven, lore heavy dialogue and questing this game isn't for you.  If you don't like a lack of handholding in your quests this game isn't for you.  If you like all of the above or are looking for an amazing RPG that says ♥♥♥♥ all to modern tropes then I can say with certainty you'll enjoy Divinity: Original Sin 2.  Honestly at full price this game is worth it, on sale it's a must buy.  Hopefully more people will continue to buy this game and support Larian, they fully deserve it and I can't wait to see what they'll do next."

Stormfrenzy88,9,3,0,October 8,Recommended,113.6,This game is the ultimate cRPG. You can just feel the passion and dedication that has been put into this game. It’s the only one that actually innovates the genre while others are still stuck redoing the 90s. Don’t get me wrong - I used to love these games back in the day but 2D worlds and antiquated combat systems of infinity style games just feel dated by now and D:OS 2 really improves upon these main shortcoming of the genre.  The main strength of the game lies within its fantastic combat system. Turn-based is the absolute best fit for party based combat that allows for incredible depth. For every encounter there are multiple approaches to consider and the way abilities interact between each other and the environment is just awesome.  Another great thing about the game is how much player freedom it allows. A lot of quests have many different ways to solve them with various outcomes. Not reaching an ideal outcome in a quest will not hinder your progress but the story will just play out differently.   The visual and sound design is truly top notch and does a great job of getting you immersed in the game world. The fully 3D world with rotatable camera is a treat to explore.  It is designed with gameplay first approach and I absolutely love it but that said the story and characters are still fairly interesting and open up a plethora of moral questions that do not always have a clear cut right or wrong answer.   The game’s lack of hand-holding and signposting mostly feels like a breath of fresh air but can get a bit frustrating at times. Of course that’s only because the tendency in recent games to overdo it has conditioned us to think less for ourselves so overall I find the direction here to be positive.  The amount of content this game offers is certainly impressive and well worth the cost.  Overall I’d say that while there certainly is room for improvements Larian has done a good job making this masterpiece that has found a place among my most beloved games of all time. Therefore I would rate this game with a nearly perfect score of 9.5/10.

amelia,155,3,0,October 18,Recommended,154.3,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game. Unfortunately, this game has the same pros and cons as the first part.  I was hoping the second part would be less buggy (but it was really bad, I had brocken quests, and glitches, and a lot of achievements in the multiplayer didn't appear for the guest player before the definitive edition, and so on). I was hoping that they will make enough content for the game, especially for the latest part  (wroooong, tons of half-empty locations, tons of useless npc, some of them look like they might be part of the quests, but they don't). I hated the main quest in the first part, because it was lame love-triangle. In the second part we don't have that (thanx you very much!) but we have a plot twist from Baldur's gate  instead (it might be worse than that, but meh).   But the game mechanics is beautiful! But you can play as undead! But THE TELEPORTATION! This game has some wonderful features which you can use for the exploration, it has some interesting exploites, which you can find, if you know, where to look. For example you can win the fight with guards and npc lvl 8 when you are 4-5, if you are patient and think out of the box. I appreciate stuff like that very much. If you are into turn-based games and tactics, this game has some challenges for you.  So this one is still hard to me. On the one hand I had quite an adventure. On the other hand I finished the game before the Difinitive edition, and it was pain in the♥♥♥♥♥ Me and my friend played in coop and we saw it all: crashes, bugged quests, sometimes game couldn't run unless you run a certain file as admin, and so on.  I really don't want to give ""not recommended"". I honestly think that in general this game is enjoyable. But I hope the developers will figure out how to make games from the first attempt, without difinitives and enhansed editions. And I also hope that the next game by Larian Studio will have enough content in any game stage."

Milk,430,3,0,October 25,Recommended,203.7,"Where do i start with this game. of all the games i have played over the last few years not many come close to Divinity Original Sin 1/2. Back on the 29th of October 2016 i finally gave in and purchased Divinity Original sin Enhanced Edition with a friend. it was such an exciting journey and i enjoyed it a lot, my only regret is not hearing about the kickstarter for the second game because i would've been all over it. but nonetheless i purchased Divinty Original Sin 2 before release, i knew it was going to be just as good if not better. after playing roughly 18 hours in my first game and getting to the end of Act 1 another friend bough the game and we started again, but who could complain the game was AMAZING. we enjoyed that playthrough all the way up to Arx where one of our party lost interest in the game which brought our journy to an early end, with such a huge time investment into a game i couldnt bring myself to start again so the game was shelved for a long while. many single player attempts were made, some mods were tried but could never get off the ground. then finally this year after hearing the Definitive Edition was coming my friend and i decided we would do it, finally play through from start to finish and it was as good as ever i could hardly bring myself to put the game down. Playing as Loshe was one of the best experiences in this game and i'm glad i picked her, getting to the end of her story and finding a certain item i bagged it and thought nothing of it until i noticed it could be used. I was taken aback it just came out of nowhere, it really hit me and i realized this was the perfect song to end our game. just over 200 hours played, this game is one of the best i've ever played i just wish there was more.  10/10 highly recommend, can't praise it enough."

They found my den of corruption, the most evil spot on the internet. It's called ""Kickstarter"", a den of evil and villainy where devs pay you money to review your game. In my case it's gone horribly wrong though and I paid them $100 instead. Obviously must be a grave error since Kickstarter only deals in illigimate shady deals where devs buy positive reviews, as Steam so openly states if you watch key-based reviews' popup.  Cause obviously, paying twice what you (will) pay makes me all the happier if it's not up to snuff. Or something. Then again bundle-buyers are excluded too, just the perfect price point, Steam's price. How... convient.  Then again no-one will read this anyway, removed from score, hidden away in reviews, you wont read this. Say hi if you do, and think about the pointlessness of this entire review. But yeah, why actually review a game when no-one's going to read this anyway, might aswell add something for the few who do... say... Wibble wibble potato trampoline.  So far I'm not dissapointed, but I'm not really playing it as meant to be, doing my best to nitpick everything and notice every little thing that's slightly ""off"".

On Friday late night I decided to have a look on this game since it was finally fully released and came out of Early Access (which was a complete disaster for me, for some reason) and I was like ""Hm..meh, just another Divinity game, not my type of games, anyway, so I will just play it around for 40 minutes before I go to bed and that's it"" And then I was like: ""WHAAAAAAT?? 5 AM AT THE MORNING??

I must admit, they release projects like this very rarely, so don't hesitate and buy this game, ASAP.  So, in summary! You should buy this game if you like:  +RPG (lol, obviously) +Rich story +Turn Based games +Detailed World and Rich Characters +Decent Graphics +Tactical Elements +Variety of Classes  Give it a pass, if you don't like:  -Lot of dialogues  -Long battles (some of them could be really long, hard and stressful, especially if you are playing on a highest difficult, so you will be forced to load your saves once again and again and again and try different tactics and approcahes) -Management. Well, some of my friends believe that games like this are hard and annoying because you need to think of a good team, perfect balance of damage dealing classes combined with healers, tank and rdd. So, if you are affraid of this, this game is not for you. -Lot of classes. 14 different classes.

I am one of those that always uses the 4 man creation mod and was a bit disappointed to only be able to make one.   Other than great so far! I will update as I play more  (update)  After playing through once and starting a second coop game with a friend I am finding a number of things I missed in my first play through. There has not been much update-wise since I installed, but I have faith in Larian so I will try and be paitent :)   One thing that I am finding in the early game is melee mobility creates a huge imbalance. A caster has usually taken out one to two enemies before my melee has even managed to engage. I think this mostly has to do with the limited gear in the early game and the somewhat absurd amount of ground effects. Ice particularly, I only found one set of ""nails"" for spiking boots, but it wouldn't let me combine them? I think the damage you take moving through fire or poison needs a bit of balancing, two steps tends to do more actual damage than a fireball directly to the face. This is mitigated towards the end of the game when you start getting magical defense on some of the heavier armors.   Updating as I go :)"
hockeyhacker97,"1,145",4,0,"September 16, 2016",Recommended,26.7,"If you played and enjoyed Divinity Original Sin, then you will really enjoy DoS2. It's got all of what made the first game great but has improved on almost every part of that, though I must say my intial save didn't start off that great, my main character I manage to whack myself with my staff in combat hurting myself more then the enemies did, I then get a Lizardman and immediatly light a ""black cat"" that is following me around on fire and then my lizardman on fire, and then I forget how the trading system works and sell all my items to a vendor for nothing in return forgetting to drag the money into the trade window. Definitly a lot more enviornmental combos a lot earlier, like very first fight Rain of blood to spread blood around and cause the enemies to bleed, then corruptionto turn the blood into a poison cloud and poison the enemy, so right off the bat they are bleeding and poisoned and wet before they even get a chance to attack and then when you have lizard man you can then light that poison cloud on fire to cause it to explode to do more damage create smoke and break line of sight. Not a bad little combo for right off the bat.  Conversations have a lot more options with race and origin story adding in more dialog options. A tension meter for when there have been a lot of crimes like theift and murders in an area which effects NPC behaviour, so even if you don't get caught in the act of stealing it could make it harder in the future.  All in all it feels like a much better game (hard to say when the first game was already great) but definitly one where if you liked the first you will love the second, if you didn't like the first odds are there is nothing here that is going to magicly make you like the second unless it was a minor thing that you didn't like that caused you to not like the game (like say not enough dialog options for different characters).  Not much else to say other then the EA is like the first DOS EA, only play it if you don't mind only having access to act 1, if you want to enjoy the entire story all at once for the first time then hold off till the game is actually released."

A lovely improvement to the ""original Divinity: Original Sin"".  You liked the previous installment? Then this is a must-have for you! Beautiful graphics, immersive world, rich plot and characters.  The only thing I really don't like is that you can't easily sort your inventory at all (currently).

I like that you can choose whatever start class, and then switch in mid game and use some of the points just to get the one skill that you want to use.  The main downside of the game is the quest browser. It's quite difficult to keep track of all the quest (even more if you are playing with 3 other friends in your party) and you cannot even search for name of quests or npcs that gave you the quest, so either you remember everything, or you get lost among all the quest.  Still I would recommend it to everyone who likes rpgs, the transition between the normal game and the fights (that are turn based) is really good."
V4net,592,1,0,May 27,Recommended,89.0,It has delivered everything the creators defined any much more.

Sandusson,151,1,0,"October 8, 2017",Recommended,381.3,"My favorite game of all time, great RPG, combat is in-depth, story is so rich, so many interesting unique side-quests, and it's all co-op friendly in 2s and 4s. My guide for enjoying it:  Find a friend (or 3) who has as much availability as you and get ready to play it in long casual sessions 100h+  Playing one of the premade (origin) characters may seem more boring but their story is a LOT more interesting  There's a way to respec later  Exploration is rewarded  Don't overdo the research, just get into it, it's one of those where going in blind is so worth it. :) "

PyroReason,563,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,14.0,"Boys, girls. My time on this game was largely spent offline due to deployment which I was fortunate enough to be able to download this immaculate game on  release. A buddy and I grabbed two Xbox controllers and leaned in close to my 15in laptop display and got swallowed into the incredibly fleshed out world fast. I had anticipated this game ever sense its announcement and avoided the early access so that I could indulge in the full experience once it was finished. It was completely worth the wait. I thought that the first Original Sin was amazing, and found mass improvements that I didn't even know I wanted in this new iteration. Everything about this RPG is done so right that so many other games fail to do. If you love Pathfinder, or DnD you'll be right at home with this game. You're steadily guided along a linear world with open exploration aspects that is just enough to satisfy. A lot of RPGs as of late choose to opt for big massive open worlds with maps littered with locations and pointless side quests that are meant to make you feel like you're in control and fail. This is what Original Sin 2 does right. I say the game is linear because it is, but in a very healthy way for an RPG. You're taken to new areas with each progressive plot line quest you complete with the right amount of extra stuff on the side that ties into the main plot either immediately or eventually. Which I love. There were plenty of times where my buddy and I looked at each other and were amazed at either what we were doing, or what the story had come to so far. Fights were grueling and some were drawn out. But with each difficult encounter, a sense of accomplishment rushed over us. A lot of fights are more like puzzles more focused on how you approach the problem at hand rather than just smashing your way through though that's also a valid option. Strategy is key here, and presetting your characters can be the difference between success and death. Something I absolutely loved was the ability to experiment and restat my characters early on in the game and have the ability to do this as I please throughout. Allowing me to mix up my strategies for each new area and enemy I came across if I wanted to. A lot of the stats you improve and traits you take are clear and meaningful. Each class has an applicable role in everything you do inside and out of combat. Skill checks are made pretty frequently and arent the end all be all if you fail one. There are several ways you can approach impasses along your journey and often times are made pretty clear. Nothing was funnier to me than when I got my hands on the teleportation pyramids and could cheese my way through certain places to progress. Sometimes the game even rewards you for trying creative approaches. The visuals here are lush and gorgeous. Environments seamlessly blend together, although on the world map it may not look like it does. You'll go from smashing voidlings to being pummeled by dragons and everything in between. This absolutely my game of the year 2017. Worth every penny"

Smackaroni,221,1,0,September 28,Recommended,118.4,WOW! What a amazing game. I will not write a long winded detailed review because there are plenty here you can read. However I will say if there was only one game to buy in the last 5 years this is it. I know this gameplay style is not for everyone but if you are somewhat interested in this genre it hits on all the marks. I had not played the first and took a shot on this game in the dark and it exceeded my expectations. Give this studio your money so they can continue this grade A work.
MochiMochi,225,1,0,January 24,Recommended,331.1,This is by far my favourite RPG game ever and one of the best games i've played in a recent few years quickly clocking in 101 hours in just 8 days this game sucks the soul out of you and demands every ounce of attention from you and god damn that is amazing.  10/10 rip guys face off to wear!
Scar851,271,1,0,"November 16, 2017",Recommended,192.5,"Quite possibly one of my to favourite RPGs of all time.  To be honest I saw Divinity Original Sin 2 while browsing for a new game to play and thought it looked very well done and decided to pick it up. I never could have imagined how badly it would hook me in. I am now going through my second playthrough on Honour mode and another playthrough with my friends and am finding all sorts of quests and meaningful dialogue I passed by while playing solo. This definately has some game of the year material. Not only with an already amazing game but with very helpful updates that make the game even more enjoyable.  If you enjoy turn based, dnd-esque RPGs; this is the game for you.  Great with friends!"
The Geoff,91,1,0,"December 26, 2017",Recommended,131.5,"This game is rad as hell. There is so much attention to detail in every aspect of the game. It easily makes it into my ""Favorite Games of All Time"" list. I would do a long, in-depth review, but I feel like it would be better received if I did pro's and con's. However, know that I could gush about this game for hours.   PRO'S -Great Story -Incredible attention to detail and good flavor text -Great characters (The sassy lizard man and sassy skeleton are my favorites) -Combat is INSANELY fun, yet difficult -There are easily over 100 hours of gameplay in a single playthrough. I haven't even finished mine yet, and I'm at 94 hours while writing this. -Tons of quests -Different factions you can help, or ignore -You can have sex with a sassy skeleton -Cool environments and areas -Magic is actually fun and useful. (Something that I think is sometimes rare)  CON's -Pathfinding can sometimes make you facepalm -Character creation could be a little more in-depth -Some quests could use a liiiiittle more direction to the player because it can be hard to figure out where to go"

Mumen Rider,106,1,0,"December 29, 2017",Recommended,91.0,"When I started reading reviews calling this ""the greatest RPG ever made,"" and even ""the greatest GAME ever made,"" I had to  try it. The reviews reminded me a lot of The Witcher 3 and it was for the same reason that I bought and played that game way back when and it's now considered my favorite game of all time. So yeah, I got a little excited.  Then I played the game and I felt kind of disappointed. It seemed extremely difficult and I wasn't used to getting the cold shoulder from a game. By that I mean compared to most games this one does not hold your hand, you won't get arrows pointing you in the direction you need to go, everything you need to know is actually in the dialogue and/or read in notes and books (and sometimes a rare hint from the narrator). I kept feeling confused on where to go and who to talk to and the quest system seemed kind of clunky and hard to understand at first.  I'm ashamed to admit, I asked for a refund at about the hour and a half mark. Then I went a couple days thinking about the game and that I couldn't believe I couldn't get into it. And then I thought about it again and again and realized that something was nagging at me and I couldn't stop thinking about it.  So yeah... I bought the game again. I looked up tips this time around on which characters people like in their party and which skills really help early game (Lone Wolf changed everything for me). And most of all I had to learn to slow down, stop running through rooms like nothing matters. This game made me change the way I approach video games. I started to appreciate the detail and get into the story, and I have to say, the story is absolutely amazing. The characters are all interesting and the situations I found myself in during certain points in dialogue had me on the edge of my seat.  Now I'm 40 hours in and I can confirm, absolutely one of the greatest RPGs ever. And I haven't even had the pleasure to experience co-op with a friend. 10/10"
Whizbang,275,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,59.5,"Corrects the issues from the first Original Sin and adds so much more.

The music is fantastic, the lore of the world is rich and deep, and the writing and voice acting are among the best I've ever seen. The gameplay and combat itself is spectacular.

Ray G. Quit,281,1,0,"November 11, 2017",Recommended,210.4,"Pretty good RPG with a classic feeling to it. A lot of content and a lot of replayability. The fact that you can play it with a friend and give him control over characters (4 party members, so we played 2:2) is just awesome and led to many laughs. I would recommend it and I'll just highlight 3 aspects of the game that were memorable about it in the good, the bad and the ugly (okay, the neutral).   The good: I hate any tactician turn-based game. Often they're overcomplicated. But this one? This one was ... definitely complex but somehow I came around to like it. Everything made sense and learning how things works by setting EVERYTHING ON FIRE was a fun experience. Gameplay is just fun, making a builds and testing them out was great, there's a lot of possibilities to go around. Lots of things to find, lots of ways to resolve an issue, lots of surprises. If gameplay is what you're after then you won't be disappointed.  The bad: BUGS. Oh my god the bugs. Not many - true, but one extended turns in a certain boss fight to make it last forever for enemy to finish his turn. Another one made me lose about 15 hours of progress, because I couldn't access ""home-base"" waypoint and had to load older save. And yet another - by a chance we found out a bug that can make you immortal duplicating an Idol that ressurects you for no cost at all so you could gear up your whole team with immortality idols and pass the game in easy mode. What the hell. Larian fix your game, bugs in key moments are not acceptable, especially after the game came out of early access.  The neutral: Story and lore. Honestly only story for your companions was any good and made you care. Overall the game is about ego trip to become divine and often we were in a pretty good spot to not care about anyone else than our own quest to power. Factions and key characters even when they started as good, sooner or later they ended up not so rightous to a point I didn't mind killing most of them. Never felt there was any greater incentive to be ""the good guy"" or choosing ""the lesser evil"" in this game. The whole world felt not worth fighting for. Maybe that is the point? It's not bad, it definitely had some depth to it, but still felt ""meh""."

Hierophant Druid,24,1,0,"December 6, 2017",Recommended,147.4,"Long have I been looking for a big RPG game in the trend of Baldur's Gate/Planescape Torment and to a lesser extend NWN and NWN2. That wait is over.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 gave me that same feeling I got when I first played Baldur's Gate 2 so long ago. It has a giant sprawling world with so many things to do and so many mechanics to make it even more fun, I spend so much time plotting on how to rob merchants off their goods/money. The turn-based combat is very addicting, I am normally not a fan of turn based combat, but D:OS2 does it incredibly well, very much like X-Com.   For those of you who loved Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 and are a bit turned off by the turn based combat, please give this game a chance because it's the closest thing we have gotten to BG.  The story of this game is alright, there are plenty of mysteries and questions unanswered at the start and middle of the game to keep you engaged. But the main focus in this game is its story and game mechanics. The way the quests and maps compliment each other makes it very addicting to completionists. You want to complete every single quest in each area. This combined with amazing visuals and great sound, it is definitely worth all the money.  I finished the game in about 140+ hours on my first playthrough, and every hour was worth it, I cannot recall a single game (next to BG/BG2) that gave me this many hours of fun in a single playthrough.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 gets a solid 9 from me."

MikiM,125,1,0,August 21,Recommended,267.7,"A living legend you can play now and your kids will play in the future and think - this game defines the cRPG genre 20~H game play: Jumped in to the game expecting it would be like DOS1. After 20~h game play in normal mode I was stone dead and had a unusable character because of a wrong build. I thought to my self - Ok, this is not as DOS1 I have to have a better plan when building my character. The thrill increased and I felt that the game was real   30 - 260~H game play: Next character was better. Played through the game and finished. Right after I started a new character, it keept on going. Played through the game again - and again. On every new start I had a better character and I amped the difficult level.   There are so many option when building a character. With steam workshop the options are almost infinite. 260H game play I have just scratch the surface when it comes to character builds and I love it   The mail story and side quest is not short - but it´s not either super long. Something in between.  If and when a DLC comes I would buy it in a heart beat.  Beyond character builds What made this game even better is split/shared screen local co-op.

frontman12,374,1,0,"December 8, 2017",Recommended,63.4,"7.5/10  I played Divinity: Original Sin 2 with a group of friends as a Persuasive Lizard, focusing on Summoning and Geomancy. Though the boulders and oil that can be thrown with Geomancy are effective, I initially focused on it to serve as a healer for our Undead tank. Undead are healed by poison, so your party's usual healer can't help them out. However, Geomancy also gave me access to Fortify which I could use to restore physical armor, and Artillery Plant, which was my favorite thing in the game. Artillery plant is a summon that exists in the Geomancy tree, whose level is determined by your Summoning skill. In the game, your most powerful skills cost ""source"" to cast (sort of a special type of mana). By the end of the game, you will be able to possess three source points at a given time. Source is rare to come by during most of the game, and even towards the end it's not necessarily unlimited. Artillery plant costs a single source point to cast, but then it can cast an extremely powerful spell called ""Acid Spores"" every two turns, among other strong abilities. If your character were to cast ""Acid Spores,"" instead of the summon, it would cost you two source points every time!  The type of discussion you see above is what makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so exciting. How can you support the other characters in your party in combat, and what is the optimal way to use your source or action points? If a member of your party has the ""Loremaster"" ability, you can examine enemies to learn their abilities, talents, and resistances. If an enemy reduces and redirects damage dealt, you may want to attack his friends first. If he has the opportunist talent, you do not want to walk away from melee range as it grants him an attack. If he has a fire resistance of 150%, fire will heal him. You want to constantly take stock of enemy composition and the skills of your party.  If Divinity: Original Sin consisted of a more linear story with more combat encounters, and lasted about 2/3 of its current length, it would be a 10/10 game for me. However, as it stands, I have a few gripes.   Although I'm sure that many players appreciate the ability to complete quests in multiple ways, I just found it frustrating. Some of the solutions are obtuse, and require a lot of poring through documents. Some of the late game puzzles, like pulling levers in a certain order or playing the enormous ""pipe dream"" game, were just tedious. There are many many quests, and in a multiplayer party it just felt like I was always receiving experience from somewhere because someone in my party was progressing on one of the many many quests in my quest log. While I'm sure some might say that I should've played with a different group of people, there are so many quests with so many solutions that often we made quest progress by aimlessly walking around.   Another issue I had with the title is just how quickly my character advanced. Each character has a maximum of 40 in an attribute, a maximum of 10 in each skill or combat ability, and a maximum of 5 in each civil ability. Each character in our party maxed out at least one of these categories well before the end of the game. In addition, the highest tier of skills in the game become available at level 16, also well before the endgame. Though perhaps others are drawn primarily for the story, this severely hampered my enjoyment of the game. After learning all skills I was interested in, maxing my summoning and my persuasion, I just didn't have as much to look forward to.  I enjoyed most of my time with Divinity: Original Sin 2. The argument could be made that this type of game just isn't for me, but I enjoyed the combat so much that is was worth some of the other irritations."

I started playing on tactician, and yeah, some fights really suck but it makes it all the better when you win them and get sick♥♥♥♥♥loot. The armor system is interesting. It took some getting used to but it's a pretty decent system when you think about it. The combat is phenomenal and has only improved since DOS1. Origin characters have great story behind them and everybody has their own motives and goals. Whether you work together or not is decided by how you play. All in all, This game is badass and I'm only 1/4 of the way through. I have noticed bugs here and there but I haven't experienced anything game breaking. When these are patched this game is an easy 11/10.  TL;DR: This game is a gem of an RPG. It doesn't hold your hand and that's one of the main reasons it's damn good.

hornhollow,650,1,0,"October 1, 2017",Recommended,83.7,"I just finished my first playthrough last night. Let's get this out of the way: this game is something special. It improves on almost every gripe I had with the original (mainly just story and pacing) and just knocks it out of the park. This is a new gold standard for what a modern RPG should be.    What's Good The companions are memorable, well-written, and have realistic motivations that make negotiating their place in your party really engaging as you strive for the end-goal of the game. (I mean, it makes sense, you can play them as the main character if you wish!)  Combat rewards creativity, exploration, and experimentation without ever feeling like it's unfair towards the player--some fights are tough as nails, but they're just puzzles that you've been given an entire toolbox to solve. It's incredible just how many viable strategies you can employ to build a party and the myriad tactical decisions you can make in combat with those interactions.  Some of the quests and puzzles are pretty inspired--I'm a DM for tabletop group and I can appreciate how hard it is to make a puzzle that's challenging and feels organic to its context while delivering on fun. So hard to do, and 90% of the quests and puzzles in D:OS2 deliver. The quests often have multiple paths to resolution, which can be incredibly satisfying.    (Minor) Gripes I only encountered a few bugs over the course of my game and none of them were show-stopping. (A few dialogue options that didn't make sense because of my choices; quicksave reload breaking a script in combat and requiring rollback; a few quests not updating / reflecting change after I made major progress in them.) The lion's share of these happened in the last two major areas of the game--which I totally understand given the sheer scope of the game.   Long story short: there hasn't been an RPG this rich in a long time. It's worth every penny of the price tag."

Nothing has to be done in a certain why, at a certain time, its your story and you do it your way 3. Demanding, even in the easiest mode , the game requires effort, which i personally love , i grew tired of games that are too easy ! 4. Re-playable, now i have almost 40 hours by the time i do this review, iam currently at 15% completion, and i already know i will replay the game when iam done with it because there are so many things that i missed when i started ( which is normal for such a huge game) , now that means that the game offers 150++ hours of entartainment!!!! When other games such as Shadow of war are at 80 hours Max( and cost 15$ higher ) , what more could you be asking from a gaming company?  In summary: iF you enjoyed the witcher series as much as i did and , you love rpg games with items, puzzles, explorations, and dialogue--->or and you are a DND fan ,this game ... is a BUY IT!!

The game is amazing as is, but the mods really let you take it to the next level.  Already, there are mods for crafting, combat balancing, new spells/items, and a host of other really cool/enriching elements that can be added.  I love to browse the workshop to see how I can spice up my next play through.  I'm more of a single-player person and so I haven't tried playing this game online, but I imagine if you enjoyed multiplayer then there will be 100s of more hours of quality gaming to be found with D:OS 2.

yvesp,67,1,0,"December 26, 2017",Recommended,375.6,"Larian turned gold to lead, but this game is probably worth it, provided that you know what you do.  First off, choose wisely your play level. I chose tactician as a veteran of RPG. I was well served. Indeed, tactician it is! But it doesn't say that you should also scratch every single little advantage that you can (steal as much as possible, stack on potions etc.) in order to be well prepared for the last fight. It also doesn't say that you shouldn't expect your characters to be heroic! Indeed, in many situations at that level you will have to resort to cheesy tactics such as some characters fleeing the combat to recover skill timers, heal, then come back while the combat has been frozen because you left one character or invocation hold it... Or by reloading consistently because you were not prepared for a nasty surprise in a combat and had nothing left to deal with it; so you reload, come back with smart prepositionning and the combat will go smoothly. I remember a fight against some outrageous horror -helped by numerous cronies, all of them more powerful than my characters despite being one level above-, which I easily lost head to head, then won after reloading, placing my characters far enough, engaging with invocations and keeping my characters far enough -actually out of combat- that I could always cast a new invocation when one died. I finally won that fight without a scratch. Smart ? sure. Pleasurable ? Hardly.  So unless you like going very slowly, always moving like there is a fight at the next step (or reloading often), managing inventories to be sure each character has the absolute best equipment, has the necessary consumables,  and so on (i.e. total micromanagement), skip the tactician level. At normal level, the game is going to be challenging enough for most players. Especially the last combat, which I never finished -I have done quite well in the first part, but am hopelessly outnumbered in the second part. I probably know what is wrong, but I won't be going back batching the potions that I am missing, respecing my characters to more useful stats, traits and spells, changing runes for more useful ones etc. you get the picture for tactician level.- So, I won't know the end of the story line I chose, and I won't change my storyline just so the last combat is easier. That's a bit sad.  And NO: YOU CANNO'T CHANGE THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL DOWN! That's a real shame!  Also, there is no excuse for larian in turning an excellent character development/combat system into the mediocre thing that it has become. In that respect, Original Sin 1 was way better. The current system has clearly been designed in order to foil the player and outrageously favor the opponents. You cannot inflict secondary effects (blinding, stunned etc.) as long as the target has magical or physical armor (a new protection that comes above your hit points.) This means that the first rounds of combat are always going to be damage dealing: you won't have any crowd control coming until you've done some attrition first. Worse: the system favors teams which choose a damage type and stick to it. I made the mistake of wanting a balanced party: the result is that I am too weak for the last fight. Actually in some fights, I had characters standing aside, watching the combat go because they did not deal the right kind of damage...  After all this has been said, I still recommend this game because the story looks good, the world is well developped and generally speakig as RPG go, it stands on the top if you don't fall into the trap where I fell.  EDIT: I finally found the courage to do what I said I wouldn't do, and of course finish the game. As expected, I had to respec my characters, and decided to go for lone wolf. The advantage in lone wolf lies not in the power of the characters (they indeed are stronger, but you have overall less firepower), but in the fact that you don't have to bother about the survival or such and such character, as well as reducing the drain on your consumables (you use two instead of four for a similar effect.) The fight was easy [SPOILERS (light) AHEAD] mostly for use of the special tea sold by Mrs Kremm, combined with at least +50% full elemental protection potions and five star dinner -i.e. all elemental damage did heal me, which both let me remove most healing spells as well as use my own offensive spells for healing-, the pawn and duck duck goose (for good movement, not mentioning spells.) Other talents which I thought would help did not (guerilla) [END SPOILERS] ; I changed my main character from pure mage to hybrid melee (fighter) / mage, helped by an archer/assassin ; as explained above, this was a choice to favor physical damage over magical damage, choice made necessary by the difficulty of that fight. I of course had to spend considerable time to prepare the characters and the consumables, buy or craft the required potions and books as well as redistribute equipment. The trouble is that in that fight I did not recognize the character(s) I played consistently from the beginning (no respec before the end), which is annying (to say the least) for a RPG! The other trouble is of course that I could not have to feeling that the hero was well above the other contenders to deserve my victory. Indeed, the stats of all other human opponents were consistently above those of the hero. Understand who can!"

The goodThere are some good changes to the first game: - you can choose your companion's class when you recruit them - you can respec your character and your companions at almost any time! - if you respec, you don't lose your learned spells/skills - you now have a skill bar with many slots at the bottom of the screen - summoning, hands-down one of the best class in the game; summons can really turn the tides of battles, especially since they can be infused with different elements - full voice acting (I know EE also has that, but the original D:OS didn't)  The so-soThere are also some changes, let's call them neutral; some I've learned to like, while others not so much: - physical and magic armor: you first have to tear through your opponent's armor before you can apply any CC to them; this bothered me a lot at first, when I didn't have the means to get rid of their armors easily, but, as you gain more skills and spells, it becomes less of a problem; there are still some weird things about this system, like you fight an attack dog and it has physical armor for no reason (I mean, I understand when a human enemy has physical armor because he has a breastplate, but a naked dog?) - you have to spend skill points on Memory, which increases your skill slots; I didn't like this at first, because I'd want to spend my points on other attributes; however, it isn't as bad, as you receive free Memory slots when leveling up at certain levels - Source Points; I still don't like this mechanic as some of the best abilities are now locked behind the need of source; these good abilities already had the disadvantage of using more than 1 Memory Slot, but you also need Source to cast them; of course, you can steal source from enemies or corpses, but enemies can also steal you source - a bit of spoiler ahead: the companions that are not in your party at the end of the first area will die, so you cannot see their storyline for the remainder of that playthrough; in my opinion, this is horrible game design, but I guess it helps with replayability - your party members can leave you permanently late in the game, depending on dialog choices, even though you had a good relationship with them (high attitude) until then; I was shocked when this happened, because I don't understand what the point of companion attitude is - new game modes: PvP and Game Master; I haven't tried these yet, so I don't know if they're good, but they're there - it also comes with a free Map Editor  The badThe game also has some bad parts, of course: - I didn't play it when it launched because I was sure there were going to be bugs. I've waited for a week or two and a few patches and played it without major technical issues (though I did have a 100% crash in an area that had a lot of lava around, but lowering the graphical settings resolved that). - on the gameplay side, as many have pointed out, the last part (Arx) isn't as good as the rest of the game, but it's not really that bad. There are some weird fights with respawning enemies in a certain embassy, but those can be avoided by sneaking. P.S.: When writing this review, I'm just before the last fight, so I'm not sure what that's like.  The uglyRed Prince and the lizard kin. They're ugly AF.  VerdictThis is a must buy for any gamer who likes party-based RPGs."

₭r⊙п6∆cᚻ,293,1,0,"November 25, 2017",Recommended,86.6,"This is an absolute gem. It is absolutely incredible. The graphics, the story, the gameplay, the comedy, you name it. I typically find top down cRPGs rather boring but this is definitely one of the top 10 games I have ever played. Time will tell where it lands but it is incredibly good.  There are plenty of full reviews out there so read those if you want a general review. Here is what I specifically like about it: Larian loves its players and it shows.  They really do. In DOS2, you can customize this game to make it the game you want to play. For example, I am not a hardcore CRPG guy. I like a more casual experience and I also want to play this with my partner, preferably without having to cash out for a second copy. While that might be difficult for most games in the genre, DOS2 lets us set the difficult to Explorer (which feels perfectly balanced for us) and play coop in split screen. It also allowed us to redo our builds after the first act so that any mistakes made could be adjusted without having to start over again. It also autosaves plenty, so we could easily recover from any mistake.  I could easily see how I could play DOS2 by myself and love that too. Or to play it with 3 friends who really love hardcore games. In fact, this is the closest any videogame has ever come to being a tabletop pen and paper roleplaying game IMHO.  Can't wait for DOS3."

It is because of this reason why it took me so long to buy the first Divinity: Original Sin. However, the combat in this game is fantastic. Unlike most turn based games where you continue select your strongest attack over and over again, the combat in this game is very strategic. Most encounters are completely unique and you must learn what works against your current enemies and how to use your environment to your advantage. If you're on the fence about this game because you're someone like me, who normally stays away from turn based games, just get it! Even if it's not on sale, it's worth every penny. I can not recommend this game enough.  Side note: If you're a more casual player, the easiest setting requires little to no strategy in combat."

There are quite a few bugs though, repeating dialogue boxes, I effectively blocked off the police station using a barrel and a chair, oh, and if you use the coin purse for it's intended purpose (yknow, putting your gold coins in it), it allows you to buy items and not lose gold, as well as just drag and drop the merchants gold to your inventory and it gives you that amount.

The game is also remarkably adaptive to various approaches, and I applaud Larian Studios for the amount of combinations of character choices, dialog, and voice over work in the game.  TL:DR: There's nothing quite as satisfying as turning a really tough enemy into a chicken, setting it on fire, and then teleporting it over a pool of oil all the way across the battlefield and watching it explode."

Second time went on to become a divine emperor of holy red dragons, vanquisher of demons, friend of dogs and chickens, the hero of Rivelon.  Third time on tactician, carefully micromanaging every single character, third time is the (or)deal!  And fourth time, going lone wolf, is the creme de la creme. Because every single minute of the game, while realising your own mortality and all the mistakes you've made, you also realize how much you missed during previous playthroughs. And how much you are going to.  And don't get me started on the couch coop factor here... Because this was just the beginning.  Long story short: This is the game you have been waiting for since Baldur's Gate 2. So much to do, so much to see, so much to cheese... together with friends! . . . . . . So many memories..  Like that time when you save a dog from a beggar who exploits him.  Like that time when you play hide and seek with a little kid to take his mind off the horrible fate awaiting him.  Or like that time when you go on a drug bust and you have to kill the addicts first, if you wanna sell their stash."
Gwynbleidd,86,1,0,January 19,Recommended,109.1,"What a brilliant game.  I am not a great fan of turn-based RPGs (or at least wasn't till now) but D:OS2 really changed that. The combat system is simply epic, both in terms of visuals and dynamics. It is so much fun to fight with strategies and due to the well-balanced difficulties, most of the fights are very exciting.  Exploring is also incredibly fun. The game has maps of decent sizes but more importantly, each act is generously full of well-scripted contents. You never know what you will find but you always know you will find something that makes your exploration valuable!  The story is quite compelling. Side stories, however, are often even more compelling. Additionally, all characters you meet have a personality that speaks to you on a human level. The attention to details for creating such a lively world should really be appreciated. Even animals have individually established personalities that make meeting them much more fun. Similarly, the dialogues are of the same quality. Very good voice acting and very well written lines.  The open-world aspect is, again, very good. The number of options you have through the gameplay is vast and unlike most other open-world games, your choices actually matter. Abundance of options applies not only to your choices of progressing through the storyline but to each part of the game. Almost everything expects some decision from you.    Graphics are very stylish and they look really good. Just by looking at the screenshots you can tell that this is a game with a fantastic world that will immerse you 100%.   The price is completely worth is without a doubt. You can easily expect 100-110 hours of gameplay from D:OS2.  In my opinion, if you like the genre of RPG at all, don't even hesitate to buy this game. This is a RPG masterpiece. "

Natebody,10,1,0,"September 4, 2017",Recommended,165.3,"Early Access Review:   Original Sin 2 is what exactly what every RPG gamer has been looking for - there's a potency to its' immersion that every EA title should aim to hit. This is the caliber of gaming you (EA devs) should truly attempt to employ!!!! It's an absolute masterpiece of Early Access gaming. A true game of D&D mixed with chess.......Larian said they posted this game on steam with a laugh, and I know why!! Ok I'll stop with the hype and explain.   (Graphics, optimization, controls, gameplay, sound.)   Graphics/Animations: 10/10  Right from the jump you notice how polished the world and characters look. From beautiful landscapes to fluid animations, I love it!!!! Nothing left to say here! Excellent job!   Optimization: 10/10  No loading screens.. LIKE EVER during your gaming experience! Excellent work!   Controls: 9/10  No complaints other than the restriction of your camera angles. Part of the experience is viewing a gorgeous and artistic world... You can never look at the sky....and view your character from better angles.. sad. Although, you can rebind your keys, you can rotate and zoom in - You feel like you're in control. Great job!   Gameplay: 9.5/10  This is where the bulk of the game lies. From story to combat - the immersion starts with the world appearance and story narrative, then ends with a blast with its' combat delivery. The combat is spaced out making you feel like you're not always in a chat box, and you'll be satisfied in casting, buffing or even simple melee attacks.  You can be whatever you want to be. Unless you want to be an orc...you can't be an orc - BUT what you can do from what they have to offer makes you feel like you're totally in control of your character's person.   Yes, customization is quite limited. I like my rpgs to let me customize my character to the ""T"" ... and this does limit you in that aspect to a certain extent...better than most games but coming from MMOs you may be disappointed. Given a more customizable character and maybe even adding a few other races .. you'll never play the same character again. Character creation is key in this type of genre - still ... Excellent work!   Music/Sound: 9.5/10  The sound and music is fantastic! ... I'd still love to hear a larger variety of music during gameplay...This will probably end up being a 10 simply because they will add voice acting and more music throughout the future acts. Excellent job!   Overall: 10/10  The story, the adventure, the combat, the scenery, the ..... oh you get it already!!!! What a phenomonal game. RPG lovers, MMO lovers...hack'n'slash lovers... VIDEO GAME LOVERS! You'll love this. I wouldn't post my first review on steam if I didn't believe this to be a game for everyone on steam. Do enjoy! Thanks Larian!"

xace,56,1,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,65.8,"One of the best games I have ever played.  Several bugs and lack of features make it fall just short of that #1 however.  My main concerns are in multiplayer. You have to play as the hosts party characters and not your own. That means playing an archer with a level 2 bow, all stats in wits and other useless talents. There is also an endless amount of bugs with multiplayer. For example, if I am host and start a multiplayer and someone joins me as say The Red Prince and I save, restart whatever, that character then becomes bugged. Instead of reverting back to The Red Prince after that player leaves, he bears that persons name and is unable to be reset, or even dismissed. You normally can talk to npc's in your party and say you want to go your seperate ways and recruit another party member, nope. bugged.  Another example is I use one of my npc's for dialect options since they have persuasion stats and my main is undead. Someone joined the game and took control of MY character and when I leveled up he butchered his stats and skills and those remained on my character after I kicked him and / or restarted the game.  These things make multiplayer extremely frustrating and have forced me to start brand new games probably about 6 times now. I haven't even been able to get through act 1. I am very wary to play in multiplayer due to all these reasons and despite preferring multiplayer in it's theory am forced to play single player to avoid game breaking bugs like those i mentioned. I wish I could provide some feedback or get some kind of bug fix on this bug I don't see an option for that. Thankfully the developer is very involved in the game and will probably fix this at some point. I am now hoping that a user created mod will fix many of these issues in the future (thank god this game has mods)  Despite all my frustrations this game is absolutely incredible in every other aspect. Everything is voiced, every npc which is amazing. Graphics are good (not great) especially for this type of game. Quests are actually fun and not all fetch they actually have lore. There is an absolute freedom: you can kill every npc and still proceed with the game. The gameplay is some of the best ever. This genre has been ruined in the past decade with games like the Final Fantasy series dropping the traditional turn-based combat for an active combat. Yeah, thats nice in some circumstances but it is extremely boring hacking and slashing repetitively just like every other game. The combat in D:OS2 is calculated, and detailed. Everything is listed and heavily focused on strategy and statuses. The game encourages using environments such as high ground and environmentals like barrels and puddles in order to gain favor in battle.   The best part of the game is the fact it's challenging. The default difficulty will probably be too hard for average gamers and those not familiar with the genre or the first game. There are two higher difficulties on top of that which are extremely challenging (I normally play on the highest difficulty in every other game) The next best thing would be that the developers aren't EA, Ubisoft, Activision, etc and force paywalls on an incomplete game and don't support the game after launch. This dev actually cares and I have personally downloaded atleast one patch per day and they have already stated that they are going to implement being able to use your own character in multiplayer which is something I look forward to. Can't wait to see what's next for this game."

Although difficult at times, you can usually figure out a method of beating fights. Despite what some people are saying, the game isn't too hard. There are so many builds/skills you can choose from and many many sidequests to get gear and level up; better preparing you for the difficult fights. You also don't need to go online and look for ""Cookie cutter"" builds. So don't let people put you off!  Although, get used to ""Savescumming"" whilst you learn encounters.  I'm not well versed with CRPG's so I was hesitant to pick this game up initially.  However, I'd now recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs.

Gilmez,113,1,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,217.3,"THE STORY: This is by far the most densely rich lore I’ve played through from any game I’ve played, where almost everyone and everything is connected in one way or another. Creating a living and breathing world, where one’s actions and decisions will affect their adventures through Rivellon. The part where this game shines the most, is how it gives the player choices on how they want to advance the story in any way the player chooses to play. Choose to be good, evil, just or whatever mood you choose, this game adapts to it and guides you to the end that your choices led to. While I’ve only completed Fane’s Story (in the moment of writing this), the endings it gives you will satisfy however you played. While you can choose how your adventure ends, the game lets you know how those actions will affect Rivellon in the future. The reason why I love this story is how grim and real this story plays out, no one is truly good or evil, it’s all a grey area, but it’s your choice on how you want to navigate in it.  THE COMBAT: There was never a dull moment every time I went into battle, or stumble on to one. While combat is turn-based, pre-battle is when things become interesting. Some approaches I found to be more fun is laying out traps and pre-emptive attacks on unknowing enemies. I can go into combat with my enemies clinging on 5% health and wipe them out with one attack. This is true liberty that this game gives to players, it gives you the tools and it’s up to you on how to use them. And this is just combat, skills can give a creative twist to combat. You can chain attacks to deliver devastating blows to your enemies or toy around with them by unleashing various Statues Effects and skills that can either immobilize them or transform them into chickens. All this creates a simple yet complex toy box you can play with. Finding out what seems fun and effective will make you want to seek out the next battle and unleash your battle plan.  THE MUSIC: I do not, in any way, have any complaints or criticisms about the music. The only thing I can say is that it is Divine. The music makes Rivellon and in turn makes you believe that it is a real place and these characters who live in it are part of a giant play. The 4 instruments that you can pick (while you build your character) creates the mood in how you want to play and you can change it any time you want.  This is the best RPG for this generation. While there are quite a few bugs the developer needs to fix, this doesn’t affect how much I love this game. "

Octus,85,1,0,January 2,Recommended,68.4,"Alright, this game is possibly one of the best RPG's I have ever touched in my entire life, and that's saying a lot because I've played a ton of them. I've never done a long review for a game like this but I love this game so much that I want more people to buy it and support the developers so we can get a thrid one if possible. To start it off this game is full content and story. The story is good, the characters are good, even the ♥♥♥♥ing environment is good. Scratch that, everything feels done amazingly! I've never felt so immersed in a game like this. There are times were im ♥♥♥♥ing energetic as ♥♥♥♥ to know more about the story and progress through the game. I've never felt a feeling like that in a long time and it wakes me the ♥♥♥♥ up like drinking a hot glass of coffee and a blow job at the same time. On the first 2 days, I had already 24 hours clocked into it, I was highly addicted and I still am.   There so much replayability, you can be the option of a sharpshooter Marksmen or a one-shot force of nature that can blow bosses back to the void and hell itself. Or, say ♥♥♥♥ it! And just change it whenever you want. The game allows you to be flexible and the flexibility feels great especially if your a person who loves testing and trying out different styles. The characters in this game feel alive and immersive, they actually put effort into the voice acting its ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, the story is wonderful im not gonna spoil it but you get really attached to people in the game. The gameplay is also fun if you've played xCOM this game is gonna be highly recognizable and incredibly addicting. And do you wanna hear the best part? There is 0 Grinding. That's right, not a single point in the game was I forced to grind off of enemies and it felt ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Every battle has a purpose and every purpose has a reason, and I love it so much.   But there is no such thing as a perfect game. There are sometimes bugs and freezes but its probably my fault for playing too long and overheating my computer. There's also that occasional what the ♥♥♥♥ and where do I go type of vibe rarely every once and a while but I think its good and bad thing because the game doesn't hold your hand but it also makes you somethings look up tutorials and walkthroughs on how to get things done if you're completly confused.  There are also those weird bugs but I don't expect any game to be bugless and as of right now the bugs are quite harmless and not game breaking luckily. Overall I give this game a solid  8/10.  Its fun, addicting, and you'll get hooked in the first couple hours of playing it. I recommend you buy it for the sake of supporting the wonderful devs and for you, the person reading this so you can play this yourself and enjoy it."

Shadow,157,1,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,11.6,"So my early impressions:  Pro's  Good Graphics Good Sound Amazing character creation (I recommend Origin Character)  Con's  ~The questing can be difficult as the game does not exactly tell you where to go or what to do. There are some quest markers on the map but not for all quests. Basically if you enjoy a ton of exploring this game is for you. Personally I like my quests to be more laid out, it's just a choice thing. ~I also find the game fights to be very challenging, but also overly reliant on the game wanting you to use elemental combos. Trying to beat down an oppenent that is not weak to a certain element or combo just will not work. But using rain then hail, or oil then fire, or rain then electric = easy fight.  If I rated this I would give it a 7/10. If the questing was a tad easier/laid out more clearly it would be a 10/10 for me. Again that is just a personal choice with RPG type games. For sure a buy.  **Edit** Need to patch a few bugs I have found. The main one being the quest journal not updating."

civb,279,1,0,February 23,Recommended,398.7,"A wonderful game with a great (if flawed) combat system, fun characters, an interesting world with deep lore and most importantly it has a full co-op story experience. You'll want to replay this game with new character ideas or to test your knowledge of the game in tactican or honour mode. But if I thought DOS1 was brilliant and needed changes, then I must admit I feel the same way about DOS2. My main issue being that the combat system filters you to certain ways of playing which DOS1 did too but DOS2 does in different ways. Party of 4? Stick to either physical or magical damage focus for all, as mixing stats makes both weak or one side essentially useless (but doable on explorer mode). Party of 1 or 2? Hit that Lone Wolf talent on character creation and you'll have the most fun the game can give. To an extent you can mix damage skills quite well and not have a bad character.   With that said, you'll have many hours of fun making characters that work and even those that don't (which you can thankfully fix after act 1)."

Nightsrow,68,1,0,February 6,Recommended,165.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 reawakened sensations I haven't felt in many years. This is definetly one of the better games I have played in a long time. If I am being fairly honest, I did find the combinations of genres a tad bit peculiar, I do however enjoy the core genres a lot seperatly (RPG, Turn-Based Strategy, Story Rich, Character Customization), so I decided to give it a shot anyways. I was a bit reluctant to pay +45$ for it, but holy♥♥♥♥♥♥am I glad I did. I do have a few Issues with the game, but they are heavily outweighed by the positive aspects (+ for positives, - for negatives).   + Fantastic setting  Now I have no prior experiences with the early/earlier title(s), but the game did a splendid job of introducing me to all the different kinds of political strife, discrimination predujice, as well as the fanatical religious zealots. I quickly became aware of the kind of world my character was living in, so I could more easily integrate the character I wanted to play.   + Beautiful landscapes  The maps are by no means short of details, with the next accessible area being even more astonishing than the first. I can't even fathom how many hours went into designing these places.   + Intriguing story	 I will make this one brief & completely spoiler free. The story is absoloutely captivating in almost every aspect.   + Loveable cast of characters  All of your potential followers (with the exception of Mercenaries), all have their own unique storylines, and backgrounds, with your game experience changing depending on who you choose to bring with you along for the ride. Personally I was especially intrigued by characters such as Lohse & Sebille, but should you decide to try out the game for yourself, you might yourself intrigued by other characters.   + Side activities, rewards & exploration   The game does a great job of keeping you busy, there is never a lack of stuff to do. Honestly 50% of the time you will probably have +10 unfinished quests in your journal. The game also does an even better job of making sure you are properly rewarded, and that also accounts for exploration. Matter or fact the game almost encourages you to explore & do side quests, because the game gets exceedingly hard if you don't make sure to gain a few levels.   + Regretting class choice? No problem homie.  Did you initially choose a stealthy assassin, but you'd actually rather play as a blazing pyromancer? Not a problem the game has got your back. After the 1st Act you are able to change reallocate your stat points, afterwards just get some new suitable equipment and you are good to go.  Now I could go on and on, about what I love about this game, but I also want to get into some of the few issues I have with the game.   - Normal difficulty is too hard at first (for newcommers).  Now I am by no means a hardcore gamer, like I previously was (I am more of a casual these days), but I personally found the earliest stages of the game too tedious to play through on the normal difficulty, and I ended up getting a bit stuck at one point, so I had to lower the difficulty until I could establish a solid foothold. However once I did get a foothold, I went back to the normal difficulty, to find it to be perfectly suitable, but an interresting challenge.   Tag values.  (For the unintiated ""tags"" are basically character descriptions. E.g. you choose wether your character was an established educated noble, or a battleready savage) Now no playthrough should ever be the same, which is why I can accept some missions only being accessible with certain followers. What I cannot accept is some character tags granting access to certain quests, while others are pretty useless apart from a few entertaining dialouges. For instance, during Act 2, you will be barred from certain quests if you don't have the scholar tag, whereas (from my own experience at least), the Barbarian tag only allows for some savage remarks. It does slightly ruin the RPG element of the game. And I honestly don't want to be forced to pick the scholar tag to get the most enjoyable experience with the game. I don't know about you, but I don't want my bearded-battlescarred-battleaxe wielding-viking warrior to be a bloody bookworm.   What to do next?   This is likely my biggest issue with the game.. I have 1 sentence to describe this in better words..  Thank ♥♥♥♥ for online guides!..	 I would really be at a terrible loss without them. The game does a mediocre (at best) job of telling you where to go next. For instance I often found myself struggling to get through opponents 2 levels higher than me (mostly in act 2), because the game did not inform me of the best area to go to in order to level up. I initially did learn to save often so if I found myself in an unwinable battle I could always retreat, explore elsewhere (hopefully the right places), get some levels and return later. Although it was very frustrating at first. Another point I want to make is that the player journal feels incredibly clumsy to look at, so I did often find myself unsure of the next approach to take on certain quests in order to proceed, so I had to look up guides so I could figure out what to do, (the game can feel like a bit of a puzzle once in a while).   = Multiplayer experience	 Can't really comment since none of my homies, play this game (And I have no real interrest in playing it with strangers), but I have only heard great things about it.   Rating	 Despite the issues I have with the game, none of them are actually gamebreaking, and are pretty much easily fixable, and their are - as I said earlier - heavily outweighed by the positive aspects of the game. All in all it is definetly worth your hard-earned money. I will rate this game a staggering = 9/10  (Also I do apoligise for any grammatical errors)."
ifm2181,18,1,0,February 6,Recommended,83.1,"With so many ways to play and succeed, DOS2 rekindles that old feeling of D&D the way many have wanted for a long time. If you're used to a game that holds your hand, you might find yourself confused or lost, as there's minimal help in the game. But if you want adventure, strategy and tactical gameplay, you may have found your time-killer. Well worth the money.  THE GOOD - The story is well-fleshed out and full of characters you'll see (or not see, if they die) again at some point. - Combat is tactical, complex, and sometimes downright difficult, even on the easiest setting. Sometimes it felt like sitting at a table of miniatures and contemplating the next move like a game of chess.  The AI is quite good, and the enemy may stay just out of range and teleport your characters into lava. - Characters are almost completely customizable at a certain point, so if you don't like something, feel free to swap it out when you want. - Audio is rather engaging. - The game easily remembers things you've done and never turns out the same way twice. - Carry weight feels limitless, so you won't have to worry about over-encumbrance bothering your honest gameplay. - Vendors have good gear almost all the time, refreshing frequently, though almost anyone can be traded with.  THE BAD - Inability to go back to previous zones for exploration or completion of side quests with no relation to the main story. This can lead to forgetting a map you just got used to, and having to learn a whole new one. - For some players, explorer mode may in fact be too difficult at some points, and you may feel boxed in, unable to explore or retreat. - Occasionally, controls regarding moving characters or unchaining them momentarily feels hamfisted. Taking extra steps to just make one character go somewhere is awkward. - There's almost never a time when you're not standing on a corrupt surface in combat, which requires extra effort to clean, extra effort you likely can't put in on time to change it. This means a large portion of your combat time will be spent dealing with endless DOTs and also an inability to heal your characters. - Pet Pal is an almost essential talent to have for one character, wasting some more valuable talent space for the ability to talk to rats.  THE UGLY - Crafting feels like an incomplete feature. Recipes are learned via experimentation or finding it in a book somewhere, but there are many times when you simply would have no clue how to craft things, and don't need to because vendors have what you need. Would you have thought you could make lockpicks by combining a hammer and nails? Never did discover how to make trap disarming kits.  SUMMARY Definitely a great game. Buy it and enjoy it, over and over again."

Abominable Wombat,"1,341",1,0,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,223.6,"This game is incredible. My personal Game of the Year 2017. I have started and restarted this game countless times already to play through it with many different friends and I still haven't gotten tired of it. Each playthough offers something new even when I think I've seen everything there is to see in the opening act.  Pros: ++ Incredible cooperative experience + Highly replayable (from nature of the game, GM mode, and mod support) + Interesting story + Cool ""origin"" characters + Fun tactical turn-based combat + Pretty good soundtrack + High-quality narration  Cons: - Could use some quality of life changes (items auto-adding to hotbars is annoying, having a designated barterer/looter because of the way skills work hurts the gameplay soewhat, etc. Just nit-picky stuff though)  Overall, this game far exceeded the expectatins I had when I purchased it. I get super excited about this game and whenever I start a session with a friend we end up playing for something like 7 hours even though it feels like it's only been a couple.

Astroflap,78,1,0,August 31,Recommended,125.9,"TL;DR Buy this game! Best RPG game I've ever played and in my top 3 games of all time without a doubt. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay here. The gameplay is quality unlike games like Skyrim which pretty much relies on mods to be fun for extended play sessions, which this game also offers. Dialog and story is also some of the best you'll find in recent games with  every piece of dialog being voiced which is just a great thing for an Indie game to do.  Seriously 9.9/10 game.  This is honestly the best RPG I have ever played and one of the best games I've played in general. This is one of the few single-player games that I just can't stop playing.   Before I played this game me and my friends played a lot of D&D, but we couldn't find enough time to play as much as we'd like since we were in our final year of school. So for ages I looked for a game that could emulate that same expirence. Being able to do what I want, having funny moments as well as epic. When one of my friends showed me this I was hooked.   The mechanics are almost the exact same as old school table top games, so iif you're into that turn based combat you'll love this, but even someone like me that normally hates those kind of combat mechanics in games I just loved these just because of how polished they were. The combat suprisingly has a lot of depth to it. There's so many different spells and equipment and many of them interact with eachother in their own ways.  The story and dialog is also one of the best I've ever seen in a game. Most of the dialog has so much character and is of such high quality, only of the voices feel as they were acted poorly, but 10000x better than you'll see in any Bethesda game. The fact that all of the dialog in the game is voice acted is also just an amaznig thing. It makes it feel as you're living in a real world and it also helps with the consistancy where some lines would be voiced and some wouldn't. This wouldn't mean anything iff the story wasn't good, which thankfully it isn't. The story is so good. It pulls you emotionally in so many different directions and you have to make so many decisions that make or break relationships and have an effect on what happens for the rest of the game.  Character creation is also pretty good, different races and classes having different traits and abilities as per usual. This part is the only part that I find to be pretty hard on new characters since some races and classes are harder to play than others, which can make it difficult and punishing. This can become a non-issue early in the game since you have the choice to pretty much change everything about you if you're not happy about it.  The one thing that I wish could be different about the game is its modding cababilities. Sadly as of now there aren't any mods anywhere near as big as mods that you find in Bethesda games, but thankfully this isn't a Bethesda game so you don't need mods to make it interesting lmao. This game does have the ability to act as your own Dungeon Master and make a whole game for you, your friends and your fellow steam gamers. and you also have the ability to download other peoples campains which just extends the hundreds of hours in the base game.  This game is almost a perfect example of what a game should be. For the gamer by not constantly trying to ram microtransactions down every hole in your body, have hundreds of high quality content from launch. Constant interaction with the community, THESE GUYS MAKE VLOGS MAN!!! and last but not least they don't do what every triple-a developer is doing now and making all their content and just releasing it as expansions. These guys are just about to release a FREE expansion that adds hundreds of more hours of gameplay which I would be more than happy to pay for since it is actually worth it and it's made to add value to the game instead of be a stupid cash grab.     SO IN SUMMARY. Buy this game, its amazing how an indie studio made on of the best games of recent times from a kickstarter with a reasonably small studio compared to multi-billion dollar companies that make subpar games at best. These people really care about what they create and it shows in their final product. I recommend this game to everyone and I feel like a better person everytime I do so."

Nxmzy,180,1,1,September 15,Recommended,72.6,"AHHHHHHHHH where to start. You are thrust into a world of magic without knowing what to do, but you use something called the HUMAN BRAIN to explore and inspect the world around you talking to every detailed and voice acted character, listening to the smooth Chocolaty voice of the narrator. This is your world, this is your land to trade and kill on or that's what I would say if it was an MMO but THIS GAME GOOOD is what I'm trying to hint at.  The Gist - You start out as a prisoner the lowest of the low (kinda, Prisoner might not be the best word for this) and are shipped off to an island for reasons you need to find out by playing the game. You try to escape and meet whatever your goal is. One thing to note is this game does not hold your hand you have to find out what you want to do or what you want to be.  Combat - The game consists of a turned based D&D styled combat where you have your move and initiative whoever has the highest initiative goes first lowest last etc... There are Spells scrolls abilities and more you can also just attack (melee) It can be very action packed at times where you're at your last heath and the enemy misses giving you one last chance ONLY TO MISS AS WELL there are also huge monsters that can kill you almost instantly in not prepared. [combat 9/10] There are just times when it doesn't work as well though  AI - Brain dead at times but it works, and can also be funny. [ AI 7/10 ]  Story - The story is kinda Celica BUT it works how everything molds together and even better for each main quest there are usually about 10 different ways you can do it or you could just skip it all together (this might only be for the first section the skipping part IDK that yet)  Map(s) - There's about 4 of them and they are each with there own story and problems you can choose to fix or simply just kill them all the people (BTW I tested this and yes you can kill every one IKR AMAZING I LOVE KILLING!!!!!) no people no problem. Every map is diverse and different from the last with different looks and settings which only helps the game to feel EVEN MORE ALIVE. (Maps 10/10) They are all ♥♥♥♥ING fantastic love em.  Quest system and shizz - For you to start a quest you must speak to someone who has one right? YAH YEET pick up a sword BOOM you just started a quest pick up a phoenix egg BOOOM you just started.... well I guess ended a quest but hey that's for you to find out. The quest system is pretty regular compared to most quest systems BUT GUESS WHAT there is no back and forth quest EX: Hey you send this letter to queen stupid face so she can send me back and equally useless letter so I can send her back another and another etc... This game Has NON of the thankfully also you can get a quest from animals these Devs were on like weed or something when making this game because some of the quests are AMAZING there was one where I had to kill a chicken. [Quest System and shizz 10/10] amazing overall.  Conclusion - This game is a must buy for D&D players strategy players and also starters it is well optimized and loading is like zipping fast but in some areas, they do throw a lot at you so be wary of that, and if the game is on sale it's even MORE worth it. So it's a Buy. [This Game is a 9/10 With a Badass seal of approval]  Quick shizz:  Cons - Kinda repetitive at times/story can lead you astray in the last part /  Pros - Good combat / Replayable / Great sound design / Awesome music / Good effects or graphics / Gorry / Charm / Fun even if you don't have friends :D (like me ;-; )."
Ragefighter,278,1,1,August 18,Recommended,437.1,"I accidently murdered at least half of the people in Fort Joy And I dropped a ""Painting of Alexander"" on one of my ""off-duty"" characters by mistake... I am off to a great start!  I really wish I could revive that party member :'( I think I got a little greedy when I decided to muel up one of my guys with all the valubles from the interior of the fort then used quick travel and some telekinesis to get stuff over to the blacksmith.  Poor blacksmith decided to start walking as I moved a chest closer in and instantly died :(  So I loaded up here belongings into said chest and headed to the Kitchen and this time VERY carefully moved it close enough to sell everything not needed to those NPC's.    All in all, I made quite a *killing* over in that zone.  But at what cost?!   I also learned that dropping stuff on people kills them... I believe it only works with very heavey stuff like a chest full of junk or those HUGE paintings.  And I honestly did not want to kill all those people via Wizard of Oz style house falling on them.  It does give the tele skill a little more utility ;)"

It has very beautful moments and the details are really awesome. I plan to play more and with friends so that is amazing that you can do that and have fun with out needing DLC, But if there is a DLC i will get it because this game is worth supporting.

It took me a while to get into the game, and the pacing regarding levelling is a little off at times (if you wander into an area where an enemy is one level higher than you it can be ridiculously tough) but after battling with it for a while it got its teeth into me. 100% Recommend buying this, its one of those games you look at the clock and wonder how 6 hours have passed."

Zero Summ,684,1,0,"November 6, 2017",Recommended,140.6,"Pros:One of the best co-op experiences I've ever played. Assuming you're playing with a patient, like-minded group. Amazing story. Well crafted characters. Decisions feel like they actually have weight. The story and characters have just the right amount of silly. It is both serious and fun at the same time. Revamped combat. I love the new physical/magic armor system. Status effects aren't as overpowered as they were in the first game (They're still insanely good.) AI. It's brutally efficient. Most of the time. Beautiful graphics engine, with all the expected graphical options. I believe all the dialog has a voice over, and the acting is excellent. The animals with human voices are especially hilarious. (Using the Pet Pal talent.) Reasonably priced at $45. No Loot Boxes/Season Passes/Micro-Transactions. If they put out and old-school style expansion pack I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Origin characters are a great addition over the first game. It adds a ton of replayability. GM Mode is amazing. You could run a full D&D campaign over the internet with your friends using this tool. Dev team is still very active in fixing bugs. An instant classic, right up there with Baldur's Gate. Steam Workshop supports adds a ton of content to the game. Neutral:Running the game two player with the Lone Wolf talent is super unbalanced. I'm kind of enjoying it though. Above level 5 or 6 Lone Wolf makes tactician mode feel like normal mode. That being said the very beginning of the game on tactician is really rough with only two people. The game is still kind of linear, but nowhere near as bad as the first game. Cons:If you're playing this game as a four person group, progressing through the storyline can sometimes feel like herding cats. Scholar tag seems overly important. Make sure you have at least one character in your party with it. There are several quests that require you to have it in order to finish. Armor scaling gets out of hand past the early teen levels. Picked up items being automatically added to your hotbars. Polymorph skills that add additional skills automatically added to hotbars. Can't fix this without using a mod, and I don't want to disable my achievements.

Even if you don’t like point and click games I urge you to try this game, I’m sure you'll change your mind. The level of immersion and character development is just unbelievable. The 6 origin characters bring out the absolute best in this game. The way each character reacts to the environment and your decisions along the journey will get you hooked.   And the combat... My god if it isn’t the most fun and addicting thing about this game. The number of classes and skills will guarantee that multiple playthroughs will not be similar.  Now onto the graphics... I don’t know if can give this game enough praise for their visuals and sound... it will immerse you into this chaotic and brutal world, the shift in music when you journey around will give you goosebumps. Each town and camp feel as if its accompanied with new ambient music.  Even though the price might be high for some, trust me it’s worth every penny! 70+ hours into the game and I still haven’t progressed much into the story. If you can try to get at least one friend to join you, I can ensure you that the enjoyment just multiplies.  10/10 A MUST TRY FOR RPG FANS! "

It has been years since I've experienced such an engrossing game that has snagged my attention so tightly, that I'm already contemplating my next playthough before I've even finished (thinking 2-Hander, Death Knight style). That too: you can effectively combine the numerous capabilities possible in the game to create archetypical styles, or something completely unique!

johnny.killstring,513,1,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,112.7,"Kickstarter backer, played about an hour or three of early access.  A couple hours into this game and I findi it to be an improvement in pretty much every regard. Most specifically, in the writing and the tone. Original Sin's writing was well-executed, but the game felt like a slapstick cartoon far too often for my tastes. A comedy game that I didn't find that funny wasn't what I was really looking for, and so I wound up losing interest in the first.  But this. Ye gods, this. Much improved.  Sure, talking to animals is still funny, but the game spends a hell of a lot less time laughing at people, and a lot more time being compelling. I'm invested in these characters, this world. I actually care what happens in Rivellon. The pregen/companion characters are lovely, the dialog keyword system is a blast, the (surprise) voice acting is *really good*, and the combat and gameplay seems to have evolved in some interesting ways.   I'll update this if relevant as I continue to play, but as of now? I'm estatic with this game.  Planning to try some co-op; I'll let you know how that goes if I do."

Ziles,210,1,0,"December 13, 2017",Recommended,68.3,"Never played the first, but I've been loving everything about this so far. I've always enjoyed the style of game that feels pseudo pen-and-paper D&D (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, etc.). But with those, and even D&D itself, I have a similar gripe with special moves and spells, which tend to work on a very limited, ""x uses per day"" system. Divinity 2 has a similar feel to those kinds of games, but most abilities and spells have a turn cooldown.  Also, where the default in those other games mentioned was real-time with options to pause on triggers, or to manually pause and unpause, combat in this is solely turn-based. Battles tend to feel a lot more strategic as a result. Also a bit chaotic, as elemental effects get thrown across the field all the time. The important thing to note is that all of your characters are likely to get set on fire or be poisoned in most battles. It's inevitable.  I haven't played multiplayer, but it's been great playing single player because of the character stories. A full party of 4, and I'm really wanting to know more about all the pre-made characters. While you can make a fully custom character, I recommend playing the first time with one of the characters that has a backstory. It's really adding to the lore to have a character with a much more fleshed out backstory than I'm used to seeing in these kinds of games, and it's been adding another layer of fun to not just roleplay, but try to roleplay my character (in dialog, you'll get prompts for why a certain option is choosable, and you'll sometimes have your character's name next to an option to show it's choosable because of their backstory, which I don't think you'd get if you made a fully custom character).  If you've enjoyed other cRPGs then all I can say is two thumbs up -- would recommend."

HadesWTF,99,1,0,"December 22, 2017",Recommended,111.0,"It's a long game, but a good game. II just finished my first playthrough at 110 hours. I didn't complete EVERY quest but I did come to some sort of resolution for most of them. Divinity Original Sin 2 is a rich and beautiful world to explore with an explosive and exciting turn based combat system. The game has a very intersting story that is 99% voiced which goes a long way in immersing you into this world. I never knew that I needed games like this to be voiced and to have a narrator. Take note Pillars of Eternity 2. It gives you this sense of going on a real Dungeons and Dragons style adventure. It conjures up feelings of Baulder's Gate 2 while being very modern and engaging. This is the divinitive CRPG experience in gaming today. I firmly believe it will be a classic like the CRPGs of old.   The game isn't without it's flaws though. Firstly the last two acts slog a bit. There are still tons of interesting things that happen and a few jaw-dropping moments, but some parts I struggled to boot my PC up and play the game. This comes right into the second flaw, the game is a little too long. You definitely get your money's worth. This game would give you good value per dollar even if it cost $100, and it only cost $45 US. It's a freaking steal. However, when it takes 100+ hours to beat a game while seeing most of it's content sometimes you just burn out a bit. Finally there are some flaws with the actual gameplay a few times. Some of the puzzles are unecessarily difficult, sometimes it feels like the enemy gets 10 turns for every 1 turn you get, and it has performance issues in a few spots.   However, overall this game is the best game of 2017. It's an absolute steal at $45 and the game tells you a story you won't soon forget. Easy reccomendation to anyone even slightly interested in CRPGs."

EX: I am trying to play through using 2 characters using lone wolf until the ship then switch to 4.  I clicked on an area for my characters to go to and instead of taking the quickest and easiest route that my main character was going,  my companion decides to go a random long route.  And of course aggro'd a group of guards. normally I would not care but.... the guards did not attack my companion they ran right past him and killed another potential companion that I was planning on using later."

Fuzzinstuff,26,1,0,September 26,Recommended,779.8,"One of my favourite games (replayed 3 times now). So many good things going for it. Character creation and development is deep and enriching. Storyline is complex and multi dimensional. Battle is difficult but, due to the turn based format, tactical choices matter. You can get totally stuck trying to beat a battle scenario, but then with one ah-ha moment it becomes clear and rewarding. Oh so rewarding!  Really no criticisms ... maybe it could be easier to manage books/letters/keys and some of the other things you put in your inventory. But that's so minor.  Can't wait to see what Larian do next!"

Kodlaken,178,1,0,"October 14, 2017",Recommended,36.3,"First I want to talk about the character creation, I found it a bit annoying to navigate and felt it would have been much better if everything was on one screen instead of multiple screens, Fallout 2 did this well, you can increase your main attributes and pick and choose skills/traits, all on one screen. The creation itself is pretty standard, pick your preset ""class"" although you can choose which abilities you want to start with, your preset will determine the pool of abilities you get, if you choose a rogue you get rogue abilities, if you choose a summoner, you get summoner abilities. The talents in this game are absolutely terrible, there are 1-2 amazing ones, 3-4 decent ones and the rest are pretty crappy and not worth picking up. Stuff like hothead, which gives you 10% accuracy and 10% critical chance, this is pretty insignificant but you know whatever its decent I guess but oh wait it is only at full health, and if you don't know, this game's combat is pretty much all about having poison and fire and all kinds of stuff happening on the battlefield, your characters will almost definitely be on fire or poisoned, it is pretty much impossible to avoid it from happening, and while your healer(s) will probably be able to keep you topped up, it just seems not worth the effort for such a small buff.  I now want to start talking about how fun the combat is, I started as a rogue and it was pretty boring to start with but as I progressed and my party progressed I was able to cast tons of different abilities and spells to change the battlefield to something that is advantageous to me. For example, I started as an undead, and being a rogue I just blinked on-top of the enemy and dropped poison at my feet, this allowed me to gain a small amount of healing and also damage the enemy, but that is just a very small advantage. You can mix elements to totally screw with your enemies, you can drop some rain down (this makes them wet) and then just use an aoe chill spell and this will freeze everybody and they will be helpless for a turn, allowing you to bash their heads in. And later on you gain the ability to change these elements even more, but that is somewhat spoilerific so I will refrain from going into details on that. Not only is it really fun strategizing how you are going to fight in battles, but every spell looks amazing and the game in general looks spectacular.  The quests in this game are excellent, there are no generic ""kill 20 goblins and bring me their toenails"" quests which makes you look forward to the next quest you will run into, everything is voiced, which you wouldn't really expect from a game that has so many different outcomes in dialogue in and out of quests. The voice acting is very good I would say, besides the NPC dialogue you will regularly hear the narrator talk, and he has a very good voice, they did a good job of making you feel like you were in the moment experiencing everything, the great descriptive writing allows you to close your eyes and picture whatever the narrator is talking about. Something I quite like is how your character creation changes NPC dialgoue, most NPC's will reward you in some way for simply being their race, some characters are seemingly racist and despise elves or dwarves (these characters are usually not involved in quests so you don't miss out on anything). There are also some NPC's that reward you in some way for having certain Character Tags, a soldier will relate to another soldier which increases relation with them, this gives a discount when trading with them which helps a bit. The game really feels as though you would have had a completely different outcome in a quest for simply having changed 1 or 2 things in character creation. It makes you eager to finish the game and restart as a totally different character and hear all of the dialogue you totally missed the first time around.  That mostly concludes my thoughts on the game, just gonna put some arbitrary numbers here.  -Gameplay 4/5 The combat is extremely fun and challenging too albeit a tad annoying when you take on too many enemies and wonder why you are incapable of winning.  -Story/Quests 4/5 All of the quests I have done I enjoyed and I look forward to seeing how the story of my character progresses once I leave the Island.  -Graphics 4/5 Not absolutely mindblowing but definitely looks good.  Overall I would say the game is very good, one of the best RPG's I have played in my life and I haven't even beaten it yet. I look forward to the rest of the game, I put 30 hours into just the first zone of the game, so I hope the rest of the game has the same amount of content and I will easily see 200 hours worth of content in this game depending on how thoroughly you play through each quest and explore everything."
Dru,96,1,0,"December 15, 2017",Recommended,154.9,"Amazing and very promising game. As it prequel, Divinity Original Sin 1, it is an awesome, interesting and funny game.   I really liked that they had different options for player who prefers the story over the combat or vice versa. I personally prefer the rol part over the combat, so this was a welcomed surprise for me. The combat system, turn based, is in my opinion a smart choice they made. A refreshing touch after all the more 'action' based RPGS, like Skyrim. You can really plan a strategy and take your time to give orders to your characters. Or you can ignore combat and focus on the story. I loved the graphics the locations are beautiful, and I really enjoyed that they were not the typical ‘European medieval forest’ type but rather deserts or tropical islands. I loved that this time we were able to play as different species (I played as the Red Prince) and specially that you could chose a premade character or a new one (with any option for species/sex/race etc). I really liked that the ‘non chosen characters’ end up being your companions. It is something that I always wanted from the first Dragon Age. Every character had a very specific personality and very interesting backstories, the same as a very funny banter.  I would only complain about the lack of lore connecting this game with the others in the Divinity Series. I found it a little bit confusing, specially regarding the first Divine divinity. I would only complain about many parts of the game still being bug (like many quests and some characters like Fane). This was disappointing but I hope that will improve with further patches.  In my opinion it is one of the most addictive and fun games that I played lately."
Pat Real,97,1,0,February 25,Recommended,255.0,"Everything that made the first game amazing, with the fat cut and a ton of new stuff. I loved the story, the detailed graphics, the wonderful voice acting, the music that has only improved from the incredible soudtracks of the other Divinity games, the new gameplay mechanics and skills, and just about everything. The annoying ""skill tier"" system of the last game has been greatly downplayed by the memory stat, meaning the only limit to what skills you can use are slots to equip them in. The combat has been improved by enemies who teleport themselves and you, inflict status effects, and generally act a lot smarter than the last game. I found the tactic of ""start a big fire and teleport anyone who tries to escape back into the fire"" that made short work of most enemies in the last game uneffective here, and that made combat more dynamic. Everyone now has physical and magical defense which guard against not only health loss but status effects, so it may become necessary to recover someones magic armor if you know the enemy might charm you. There are dozen of examples like this. There are plenty of standard skills like fire, warrior, necromancy etc but the one that really stood out to me was polymorph. Spread wings and fly around the battlefield or turn enemies into helpless chickens or grow bull horns and charge enemies from great distance. There are so many great skill combos and plenty of tricky enemies to use them on. I honestly believe this game will go down as one of the greatest RPGs of all time along greats like Deus Ex and Baldur's Gate. It offers the same level of freedom in quest design, combat, and story that all the greats do. I have heard a lot of games like Mario Kart referred to as ""friendship ruiners"" and this game is the exact opposite. Its fun solo sure but if you have a nerdy friend or spouse or whoever, this game will be a great bonding excercise. It supports controllers in a smooth satisfying way for such a complex game. I look forward to another chapter of this fantastic series and an eventual console port so I can buy and enjoy this masterpiece all over again"
Really Tight Ear Muffs,63,1,0,"December 15, 2017",Recommended,177.5,"I highly recommend this game! I have almost 100 hours into this game and they've been a GOOD 100 hours. The most surprising part of this game is that the story is good. You have to make serious decisions that can have lasting ramifications on the game. The story is great, but the game play is also great. Mind you, it's pretty hard. Just when you feel like you're doing really well, the enemies ramp up and get harder. So this is a pretty challenging game, but it's also very satisfying.  I really enjoy the different builds and the ability to reset your character. That means that if you get bored with a play style or run into a really difficult section, you can respec. As soon as I beat it, I will likely play through it again as a lone wolf.   There were a few bugs that I ran into, but reloading and doing something else first would fix it. For example, if interacting with a certain object causes the game to crash, travel to another area, do some trading, then come back. Or use a different character.   I have only two major complaints. The first is inventory management. Moving things around is tedious. I like having the Wares system, which is where you can move an item into this category called ""Wares"", then sell all your wares at once to a vendor. Saves time with the vendor, but not placing them into wares. I also had my strength hero be the pack mule. So I'd have to move the item to the Red Prince, then right click and move to wares. Tedious, but manageable.   The second complaint is the persuasion system. It seemed like I failed literally every persuasion attempt for the first half of the game. I gave up on making it work. See, I would see an Intelligence-based persuasion attempt and would say, ""Ok, I'll use my dude who has maxed intelligence."" FAIL. What the heck?! Turns out that not only do you need high intelligence, you need high persuasion, which is a stat you can level up. Later, when I had more points to spare, I maxed out persuasion on two characters, one finesse based, one int based. That way, I always have someone who can win that persuasion. It was minor and I was able to live with failing literally every persuasion attempt.   Anyway, I give this game a 9/10. The only reason I don't give it a 10/10 is because my summoner can't have more than one summon out at a time! I want to summon my spirit wolf, summon my incarnate, and summon a bone widow from my summoner main! But alas, you can only have one summon out at a time.   BUY THIS GAME"
Faas,161,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,97.8,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a masterpiece cRPG. It's got an awesome balance between fun, roleplaying, exploration, tactical combat and nice stories.

The Source Is The Source,189,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,150.6,"This game can only be decscribed as a labor of love, and Larian Studios should be praised for what they have accomplished. In many ways this game is the gold standard for what a sequel should look like. The combat is exceptional, it lets you approach a combat situation from multiple angles, environmental interaction is wide and vary, and percise usage of skills is critical to controlling the battlefield. The story is entertaining, and every side mission you happend upon is either hilarious or contributes to the lore of the world  with great voice acting for every major/minor NPC (even the animals are voiced and some will even give you questlines). Finally the environment of the game itself is gorgeous, ad the amount of detail that the developers have put into this game only gives it a more immersive feel as you explore the game. It is a must have, and is a golden example of what we should expect from game developers from any genre/franchise."
WinterScout,194,1,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,683.4,"Divinity Original Sin 2 was the first game of the Divine games that I had tried / pickup and really enjoyed myself when getting through the game and making progress with my original party. From my personal experience, DOS 2 offers unique ways to solve different quests while also being punishing if you screw it up and not letting you get a retry button (unless you reload a save). From the character selection to the origin characters, divinity has a very vast variety of options to choose for your characters skills, do you want to be a tanky mage? or how about being an rogue who can polymorph enemies into chickens. When you get into the game after making a custom character or choosing one of the six origin characters, you are able to pick up to three other origin characters to recruit into your party and journey along together till you reach your end goal. What sets this game differently from an RPG like skyrim or fallout is that you actually get to do side quest for your companions and are able to learn more about him or her through dialog, not having bland reused dialog changing with the envoirment and how they see you as an ally or an enemy depending on if you're being rude to them. On top of all of that another part that I enjoy is that all most all dialog (except some that have been added recently to put players in the right direction and some that are just bugged) are 100% voice acted, from the Red Prince to a dog in Fort Joy each entity has its own character and appeal to them. One thing that makes divinity shine from most RPGs is that you can physically kill any NPC you want, from entire towns to some of Fort Joys residence (But killing origin characters will cause problems with the main story line so avoid doing so) allowing you to kill a trading that you might have a grudge over if you want some of their loot from their store. Finally the loot system is extravagant allowing you to have different loot while looting dungeons in different play throughs based on Lucky Charm and loot tables that were generated in the game, while also not completely dropping the NPC's inventory if killed making it more useful to pickpocket them for their better wears before killing. Overall I love DOS 2 as a game, it personally has to be one of my favorite games released this year, should you pay $45? Yes this game is worth every cent the COOP is amazing and the story and side quest will have your save be longer than 40 hours or more depending on if you go into the nitty gritty."
FunkyBuddha,167,1,0,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,63.7,"The game starts a little rough/boring when you're on the ship (I did not like it at all), but after that short area the game slowly opens up and before you know it you have been absorbed into it. The attention to detail (all animals are voiced but you only talk to them if you spend a point on the required ability), the flexibility that your abilities come with opens up many options for battles and exploration that is mostly limited by your imagination, and the little hand holding when it comes to exploration (you must talk and explore around instead of waiting for ! marks and waypoints) allows for a greater immersion. I got this game not expecting much outside of a regular RPG, but what I got was an old school DnD-esque game with a lot of depth and ♥♥♥♥ me if that's not something that we haven't seen in ages. If you liked games like Baldurs Gate and the more recent Pillars of Eternity then this game will grab a hold of you and never let you go."

A couple hours into this game and I findi it to be an improvement in pretty much every regard. Most specifically, in the writing and the tone. Original Sin's writing was well-executed, but the game felt like a slapstick cartoon far too often for my tastes. A comedy game that I didn't find that funny wasn't what I was really looking for, and so I wound up losing interest in the first.  But this. Ye gods, this. Much improved.  Sure, talking to animals is still funny, but the game spends a hell of a lot less time laughing at people, and a lot more time being compelling. I'm invested in these characters, this world. I actually care what happens in Rivellon. The pregen/companion characters are lovely, the dialog keyword system is a blast, the (surprise) voice acting is *really good*, and the combat and gameplay seems to have evolved in some interesting ways.

This game is so good and your intelligence is actually important for once in a video game. This game makes you think and genuinely has a difficulty setting that challenges the player. Too many games nowadays make their games for casuals, which don't this game still has an option for, but the combat feels so good especially when you're playing on tactician and actually have to think.  The visuals are amazing in this game, the combat is so in depth. The mechanics and animations are very fluid and make you able to become much more immersed in the game.  I love exploring every corner of the map and finding the smallest and most interesting. Easily the best game of the year, and I genuinely mean that. Even if you're not into turn based games, this game is worth your time. The face that every character is voice acted, and every box you open is there for a reason, it makes you feel like the developers actually put effort into their game and cared about creating a real and genuine game for you to play.

Gnork,281,1,0,October 11,Recommended,153.0,I can fully recommend this to any CRPG fans. It is the closest to a modern Baldur's Gate or Icewind Dale.   Looking very much forward to the next one in the series or an expansion :)

Tritotamar,79,1,0,April 18,Recommended,93.8,"I'm just going to copy-paste my review of 1 here and amend the parts that have changed, overall this is basically the exact same game as the first with a different story.    This game varies wildly between really great and confusingly terrible.  Good:  -The combat is amazing and the ways you interact with the world are interesting and sometimes novel. -There are some pretty fun / interesting / unique puzzles. -The voice acting is pretty good. (except anything involving goblins, they obnoxiously hiss all their s's) There are few enough of them now that it isn't a problem.  Bad  -Inventory management is a nightmare. I'm pretty sure it was made to be as obtuse as possible, which is a problem when you're contantly getting buried under garbage you need to sift through. This has been improved, but it's still tedious.  -The puzzles that aren't good (most of them) are really awful. They are either ridiculously tedious or obtuse, or both. The devs apparently thought that searching rooms pixel by pixel to find tiny camouflaged buttons is fun gameplay. It is not fun gameplay. It happens all the goddamn time.  This is absolutely still the case, some of the puzzles are goddamn idiotic and will absolutely destroy your immersion and enjoyment. Pixel hunts are much less common at least.   -The difficulty curve is strange.  The first main zone (levels 3 through ~9) is far harder than the rest of the game, and is capped off by a boss that is frankly complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.   Difficulty curve is still real frontloaded, but the bigger problem is accidentally wandering into encounters that are 2 to 3 levels higher than the one you're supposed to go to because they were closer, and the game wasn't clear about the order you're expected to do things in.   - Every once in a while the game will just instantly kill you in a way you couldn't reasonably have expected. This isn't a huge problem since quicksaves are fast and easy but it's still frustrating.   This doesn't happen anymore as far as I can tell.   -So much running. So much of your time in this game will just be spent running through places you've already been.    The game has great combat but everything that isn't the combat tends to be tedious garbage or trying to figure out what the ♥♥♥♥ the game wants you to do because it never bothered to tell you.  Pretty mediocre on average but it does enough different and there are enough fun and unique moments that it's worth trying out. (It's long as hell though so set aside some time. One playthrough took me 55 hours.)"

ventzz,24,1,0,June 13,Recommended,126.8,"Absolutely fantastic. An immersive experience, filled with different possibilities, choices and paths, it's amazing how many ways there are so you can achieve a particular goal. At first glance, I expected something Diablo-like, but what I got was even better. You can play the lone wolf, sure, but if you do opt for a party, the characters are not to disappoint you in any aspect, as their backstories and goals are most captivating and make you actually care for what happens with them. Combine that with the great effort put into the voice acting(the accents make it even better) and interacting with other characters becomes a joy. The soundtrack itself is also surprisingly good and when Impish Pocket Realm(or Quirky Bones) first played, I fell in love. tl;dr; This game came out as a HUGE surprise to me, for I discovered it by accident and wasn't expecting it to be nearly as entertaining. If you do like RPGs, do yourself a favour and be sure to check this one out, it's absolutely worth it."

Storyline is complex and multi dimensional. Battle is difficult but, due to the turn based format, tactical choices matter. You can get totally stuck trying to beat a battle scenario, but then with one ah-ha moment it becomes clear and rewarding. Oh so rewarding!  Really no criticisms ... maybe it could be easier to manage books/letters/keys and some of the other things you put in your inventory. But that's so minor.  Can't wait to see what Larian do next!"

I clicked on an area for my characters to go to and instead of taking the quickest and easiest route that my main character was going,  my companion decides to go a random long route.  And of course aggro'd a group of guards. normally I would not care but.... the guards did not attack my companion they ran right past him and killed another potential companion that I was planning on using later."

Moustachio'ED,40,1,0,February 25,Recommended,52.1,"The game itself is great and a true continuation and development of all that was loved and praised about the first Original Sin; however, and it's a big however, the engine is buggy as hell.  There's an odd core usage issue which means that multi core cpus are not utilized and the game dumps everything onto a single core - notice the strange frame skip stutter when panning?  That's a core usage issue and nothing else.  It seems the devs either don't care to fix the issue or can't fix the issue, which means one has to set the processor affinity to a single core and then back to all cores in task manager every single time one plays the game.  Not cool.  So if they sort that out, it's a highly recommended game; if not, it's still recommended but be prepared to tune your system every playthrough.  Oh yes, also there are issues with overclocked CPUs and GPUs.  Come on Larian, get your technical issues as sorted out as you've gotten the combat in this game."

❀ Nes ❀,142,1,0,August 25,Recommended,155.4,"Let me start off by saying that I don't normally write reviews for games unless they are exceptional. This game lies in one of the few exceptions where I have to.  I bought this game when it first released but I didn't have a good computer to actually fully enjoy it. Fast forward to recently when I did buy one and I fully spent the time to play this game. At first, it seemed difficult for me as I never played the first Divinity and tried to learn my way around the game. Not that long after, I got familiar with the story and the lore. From someone who doesn't enjoy care about the plot of most RPG's or MMORPG's, this game somehow brought the story forward for me to be interested in. I personally built an attatchment to my character and my companions as we continued on this adventure through Divinity. It was an amazing experience and that was when I knew what a gem this game was.  Some of the elements that I found compelling about this game was:   The voice acting - The many actors who portrayed the characters in this game did not disappoint. At times, I was just shocked at the amount of emotion and passion placed into each line of dialogue. My personal favorite was the voice actor for Lohse, whom I felt went above and beyond what some would just skim past. Also a big round of applause to those actors who put themselves out there to voice each animal or dungeon rat that was available throughout the game.   The combat - The understanding of many tactical aspects of each combat situation made it harrowing for me, in a fun sort of way. It was fun to experiment different strategies to clear a particular room of enemies or be faced with decisions that could affect whether or not my party makes it out of combat alive. The high-ground/low-ground system made it particularly mindful to pay attention to your surroundings while the natural elemental occurences (such as oil, poison, fire, etc,) keep you on your toes.   The storytelling - As stated in the above paragraph, the story is phenomenal. I found myself always wondering what would happen next and how my actions would affect the world down the line. It was truly one of the times where I found myself relating to my character, as if I were them rather than me controlling them. I truly loved the way the world was set up and how mostly everything had some role to play either in the narrative of the story or just to contribute to the feel of the world.   The world - Speaking of the feel of the world, everything was how it should be to establish a world that felt dynamic and alive. NPC's truly made their experiences feel real with some having problems that seemed normal and how they were portrayed. I sometimes imagined the theoretical lives of these NPC's and treated them as if they were real people with their own past experiences. When a game can make you engrossed into their world, you know it is good.   Music - The music was excellent at many areas and shifts according to the environment that you were placed in. Dungeons or naturally spooky areas had a feeling of dread but the suspensful and harrowing music helped contribute to the feel of this.  The music that played during the ending fight actually had me tearing up as even though it was something that I heard so many times, knowing that this was final area made it truly special and evoked a lot of memories and emotions of the overall adventure   Overall, I had just finished my first campaign and am planning on finishing more as to learn more about the companions that I did not choose at first and to see all the possible routes that I can go through before I eventually clear up the game. The game's amazing and a big thanks for Larian Studios for putting out such a masterpiece. I can't wait for the Definitive Edition to come out but until then, there are many mods and more to keep you continuously entertained. 10/10"
ven,120,1,0,"December 5, 2017",Recommended,174.5,"God, I love this game so much, it might be my new favorite. I haven't had my tactical itch scratched since Wakfu went down in flames.   My main interest in a game is figuring out crazy combos that no one else has thought of that are actually really strong and/or broken. This game absolutely allows for that.  This game is visualized D&D. I'm in love."

angryhamster,17,1,0,August 27,Recommended,138.9,"I don't ever do reviews normally because I always think, why the heck would anyone be interested in what you've got to say?! lol! But this is how strongly I feel about this game!   A bit about me ('cos hey this is what you came to read right?! Nah, I just thought if you're like me you might enjoy this game too) I'm a 37 yr old female gamer and I love games ranging from GTA:V, Mass Effect, Battlefield, CoD, The Elder Scrolls Online, Skyrim, Dishonoured, God of War, The Witcher 3, Final Fantasy to Stardew Valley, Command and Conquer, Tropico etc, as well as all the retro Nintendo classics on NES, SNES, N64 and Gamecube etc.  So I've got a pretty eclectic mix of games I like, and I'm definitely not a gaming pro, more a casual gamer who just happens to get absolutely addicted to great games!  I stumbled on this one day browsing my queue and I'm beyond happy I did.  I actually think the storyline's ten times better than Skyrim (and boy do I loooooove Skyrim!).  The graphics are stunning and the music is so on point it's unreal. I've sank over 130 hrs into DOS:2 and if I didn't work full-time for a living I'd have probably sank in triple that amount, this is how engaging I've found it so far!   From having played games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights back in the day, DOS:2 immediately caught my eye as I fancied a nostalgia trip.... but damn it was SO much more than that! The narration is brilliantly engaging, witty and fantastically acted, and the love that Larian have put into building their characters backstories is blindingly obvious and unparalleled.  There's so much depth in there and it's so well padded out that I honestly can't fault it in the slightest.  Larian just became one of my favourite studios and I wish I'd known about DOS:2 when they were securing funding over on Kickstarter, because hell yeah I would have backed them!  The only thing I struggled with to begin with was the difficulty, in that modern games tend to spoon feed us tidbits and tips on what we should be doing in a game, they're full of map-markers and quest highlights on the map etc. specifically guiding us to the people and places we need to see, the tasks we need to do.  DOS:2 on the other hand demands that you think on your feet and outside the box! Sure it has a journal function with your quests loosely written in (actually in a journal format though), but it's absolutely down to you to work out how to accomplish that quest and there's zero hand holding.  But to be honest with you, it's actually something I've come to love about this game, for once it's a game that actually really requires to start using your brain, otherwise you're going to miss key elements of a fantastic story.  Enough waffling from me, just do yourself a favour and if you love RPGs of any kind, buy this! - I'm over 130 hrs in and I'm on Act 4 already looking forward to my next play through!"

The Fleshining,114,1,0,July 3,Recommended,69.7,"Have you ever asked yourself what would happen if they could make D&D into an actual videogame? Well look no further! I've been on the fence about buying this game for a while, I finally picked up this game on sale and I'm so far 17 hours into playing this game. All I can say is this may be the greatest RPG I have ever played. Does it have the greatest graphics? No. It is mouse click controls as opposed to WASD. This game more than makes up for all of that with the richness of it's story and lore. In additition the character customization as well as the sheer amount of decisions you can make to complete a quest are vast and astounding. For a game that is not that graphics intense it is still 26 GB and you can see where all that memory goes. You can talk to every single NPC and animal (if you have that skill) in this world and they all have a voice you can actually listen to. You can kill any NPC you want but keep in mind that everything has a consequence in this game. Combat is interesting and again, depending on what skills you have, can be approached in multiple ways depending on the challenge. You can be a ranger with wings, fly up to the high ground and have a tactical advantage. Have a battlemage, shock the most powerful foe, stun lock him while the rest of your party kills all the others. Be a rogue and give every enemy the suprise buttsecks.... everything is a possibility in this game. If you have looked at the game description and been intrigued but maybe not convinced to buy this game, don't even think about it just buy it. You will get your money's worth. This is a game I see myself replaying multiple times in the future."

Starting from Betrayal at Krondor, Baldur's gate, Neverwinternights, Icewind Dale, Dragon Age-this game trumps it all. I'm still just 90 hrs into the game and this game blows me away.

My guide for enjoying it:  Find a friend (or 3) who has as much availability as you and get ready to play it in long casual sessions 100h+  Playing one of the premade (origin) characters may seem more boring but their story is a LOT more interesting  There's a way to respec later  Exploration is rewarded  Don't overdo the research, just get into it, it's one of those where going in blind is so worth it. :) "
SilverGhost,0,1,0,"October 18, 2017",Recommended,104.9,"I blinked, and 100+ hours later i'm playing my 2nd run through of the game as Lone Wolf. There's so much to discover, and redo that you can only do this game justice by playing it twice and that's not including the re-rolls when you first start.  There's not much to be said that hasn't been said already - I will say that this game plays smoothly and beautiful on my older gaming rig (7 years old), GTX 750 TI.   I recently tried playing Warhammer II and it was so sluggish - i know it's apples and oranges, but i didn't want to spend $2k upgrading my machine.  Point is, there are amazing games like DOS2 that are far more accessible, and far deeper than a lot of the fancy games out there."

Gulthor,136,1,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,208.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is an isometric computer RPG in the tradition of old-school pen & paper RPGs (such as Dungeons & Dragons) brought to the digital age.  In DOS2, you'll take on the role of one of six characters (or create one of your own) to explore, interact with friends and foes through interesting dialogue options, and engage in tactical turn-based combat encounters.  Whether you build your own character or play through the story of one of the six Origin characters, you'll be able to fully customize your character by choosing skills, assigning attributes, and picking talents that all synergize to make interesting and unique builds that change your options for interacting with the environment, with NPCs, and in combat.  As you play, you'll recruit the aid of up to three other characters (chosen either from the remaining available Origin characters or hired from a mercenary captain), but be warned; while choosing to travel with fellow Origin characters will open up new and interesting storylines to explore, your goals will sometimes be at odds. Like your main character, you'll also be able to customize your companions, creating a party that can stand up to the challenges that await you.   Alternatively, play with up to three additional players, and explore Rivellon together in jolly cooperation.  Although DOS2 is not procedurally-generated, and encounters are placed and not random, the choices you make and actions you take have long-term consequences that can dramatically alter your play experience, but in a way that feels surprisingly natural - even intended!  DOS2 is complex, and what seems intimidating to start quickly becomes a deep and engaging experience that both challenges you mechanically and drives you on to experience more and more of the story it has to offer."
masterfrown,29,1,0,"December 4, 2017",Recommended,147.4,"Really great game. True freedom of choice is provided to the player, allowing for a wide array of possibilities which prove to propel an already interesting game ever higher. Add in the wonderful art and attention to detail, and you have a very enjoyable experience."
モモタロス,197,1,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,90.7,This is the best RPG to come out in 2017 due to the huge customization options available and the narative that's written. A must buy for fans of the RPG genre.
Vejita,282,1,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,93.4,"Another great entry in the CRPG genre. I would argue that if you've never tried the genre, this should be your first stop."
Katz,193,1,0,"December 13, 2017",Recommended,179.1,"One of the best RPGs I have ever played, Divinity: Original Sin 2 truly is a work of art. From character creation to waking up in the prologue, the player will experience a familiar and welcoming feeling similar to creating a character for a tabletop RPG. This is pen-and-paper put into video game form in the truest sense.   Character creation is simple, and handled rather well. Though there is a slight lack in customization where one must choose face x through y and skin color x through y. Although the amount of races to choose is actually impressive. Alternatively, rather than playing a custom character, the player can experience the story from the perspective of one of the six, well-written, story characters. The races are vast and different in their own right with Human, Lizard, Dwarf, Elf, and Undead to choose from. They each face their own difficulties but all have unique boons or bonuses. Each class is just a combination of skills, a preset of gear and skills to start the player off with as customization and 'build-your-own' is heavily emphasized soon after the prologue. The player even has a choice to select a pseudo-background for their customized character of anything between a noble, mystic or barbarian with plenty more to be earned through the Roleplay elements.  Combat is very in-depth and ties in well with character customization. Skill trees and the skills, themselves, interract with the world differently in, sometimes, unexpected ways. The way combat feels is amazing, satisfying as it is turn-based combat done well. Abilities and spells, positioning, and the wide range of items make it one of the best features in this game, though one that is difficult to master. Spells can set the ground ablaze, clouds of poison can be created, and a combination of thing A and thing B can create explosions, electrified hallways, and giant spiders made of bone. Feedback, something important for combat, feels good. Powerful spells feel powerful and two-handed weapons feel weighty and hit hard. An overall enjoyable experience.  For those less combat-savvy, there is always the option to talk yourself out of a situation. The Rp elements are some of the finest done that I have seen in recent years. Skyrim has nothing on this. Each conversation and attempt at persuasion can change the experience of playing through the game. Accidentally anger a skeleton? Talk her to death- Yes, that was a thing that happened. Got caught stealing? Convince them otherwise! Need help solving a theft? Talk to a rat! The conversations and interractions with NPCs around the world are some of the best I've ever seen. From sad tales of a family lost to the hilarity of a cow attempting to tell your future. Or, simply murder them all if you can. There is freedom here that is just waiting to be explored.  On top of all of this, however, is the fact that this game has a co-operative feature of up to four players. Each player can choose to create a customized character or take the role of one of the story characters. While it is set up for an enjoyable single-player game, the ability to enjoy the full game with friends or family is also very welcome. The party is able to split up completely and roam the world if desired. There are also ways to troll your friends by Dying poison red, and giving it to them as a gift. Or, of course, you can all become Heroes.  The storytelling in this game is deep and rich as is player choice and freedom. The combat system is well thought out and satisfying. Even the character creation, simple as it is, gives the player more freedom than in most games to change almost everything stat-wise. It is easy to see that this game is made with love, and the developers have shown it clearly enough through this game that I regret not being able to support it on kickstarter. I cannot recommend this game enough. It is a gem and a must-have, even if you are not a fan of turn-based strategy games. This is, first and foremost, an RPG. If you have ever played D&D, Pathfinder, or any other table-top game then Divinity: Original Sin 2 is for you."

noot,610,1,1,"December 29, 2017",Recommended,95.0,"tl;dr:  Divinity OS2 is one of the best RPG's and one of the best Co-Op games out right now, and quite possibly the best game I have played in years.  A friend of mine got me this game as a Christmas gift, and I have not been able to put it down since. I enjoyed Divinity OS1 before, but this game manages to outdo it in most aspects still.   The story is amazing. It truly makes you feel like every small decision you make matters, and changes both the course of the game, the way your characters personality forms and how they interact with party members and the world in general(and obviously how they react to you as well).   Most if not all dialogue is fully voiced by great voice actors(including the narrator), the sound track is atmospheric and immerses you straight into the fantasy world, and the graphics and world design are gorgeous.   When I played the OS1 for the first time the slow-paced combat kind of turned me off at first (I thought it was quite hard to survive, and kind of confusing), but once I got more into it I grew to like it, and with Divinity OS2 all my doubts about the turn based combat have vanished. It is a lot of fun to plan out your next moves with your friend. The game wants you to be creative and tactical in combat, so you better not try to run head first into every fight, or else you will probably end up dying many times.Rather you will often use the environment to your advantage( which reacts to pretty much anything you do ) applying status effects, luring enemies away to overwhelm them in numbers and combining elements with your party members to cause havoc.   The companions have rich stories, are fully voiced and quite interesting (I had a hard time picking a follower because they're all quite cool).   That's pretty much all there is to say: if you like (Old-School) RPG's and don't mind the slower paced more tactical combat system, this is probably the best game out there right now."
Vito,197,1,0,"November 28, 2017",Recommended,122.3,"Divinity 2 Original Sin is hands down the best RPG I've played this year. Possibly the best videogame... Loved the Baldur's Saga, loved the Incewind Dale, loved the original Torment... This is, in a nutshell, a unique masterpiece. Play it or live in complete ignorance without knowing what an amazing game you're missing."
Rabid Rabbit,50,1,0,September 26,Recommended,345.0,"This is honestly one of my favourite games of all time. The story, the charcter design, customisation options, the in-depth class building and mixing, the co-op opportunities; I could go on forever saying what this game does brilliantly and how amazing of an adventure you would find yourself on if you bought this game, but i doubt that steam would allow such a long review. simply put, this is one of the best (if not the best) RPGs out there. And like many RPGs, this game is very supportive of mods, which is something i would definitely recommend looking at if you wish to spice up the game [Note: Be aware that this will disable achievements]. The modding community is one of the best modding communities out there, opening up opportunities for new, crazy classes to choose from, increased enemy difficulty, more customisation options, different buffs and de-buffs for you, your allies and your enemies and so much more. what's more, every character has a voice, even your custom character! no more suffering from silent protangonist syndrome, your character all the freedom in the world to speak their opinions.   10/10 would recommend to anyone who like RPGs and is invested in a good story. Good job Larian Studios, keep up the amazing work."

retronym,133,1,0,"December 27, 2017",Recommended,140.6,best isometric rpg ever. vast improvements on DOS1.  some argue the game falls apart in third act but you'll have gotten its value and more by halfway through the second.
Hotshot,99,1,0,June 29,Recommended,177.3,"Narrative: DOS 2 has a true fantasy story. It is one steeped in mystery and pushes the boundaries of creativity.  Each character has a unique subplot completely entangled with the main story. The side quests tie in with the games central themes and main narrative very well. Accordingly, they dont seem out of place or tacked on but are very believeable in the world crafted by larian studios. Music: The music works. It sets the tone quite nicely for the various parts of the world. It goes from epic to playful to somber to tragic in parallel with the envirement or scenario. Gameplay: The gameplay is very strategic with nuanced application. You must defeat intelligent and powerful Antagonists. Your set of abilities can be used envirementaly and you must keep your wits about you for the entirety of the game for both battle and exploration.  Characters: the ensemble cast of main characters each have their own ambitions, dreams, and philosophy. They are not just along for the ride. If you dont want to play as one of them you can create a character whose complexity and depth extends as far as yourself. Most if not all of the NPCs have believable ambitions and reasons for either deterring you or assisting you. there are many factions of npcs and 2/3 of them will seek your destruction depending on your choice so replayability is permitted. I have finished this game once and this is a reflection of that experience.  Since this is truly a great game, I wish everyone to play through and experience its wonders, for that is why I recommend the exploration mode for anyone that is turned off by the difficulty, so they can focus on exploration. I say that because the world and its characters are a spectacle to behold. This is the purest Role Playing Game i have played and I look forward to the future of its developer, Larian Studios."

Thalriel,160,1,0,"November 25, 2017",Recommended,493.8,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is beautiful, turn based rpg game which so delicately crafted it's not like anything I have ever played before. Character voices and narrator is so immersive you will care about and/or at least have feelings for each character you meet. You can create your own character or choose to play characters with origin story, you can customize them, well, with enough details. Characters with origin stories, however, have more questing content. Each zone is different from one another, has outstanding main and side storylines. I recommend you to complete the game with doing most of the quests and not just main story. In terms of combat, D:OS2 offers many ability schools with wide array of spells to choose from (and you can mix some spells!). Dangerous and helpful surfaces, buffs and status effects have so much effect on combat that you will need to plan your every turn with care. Also it's not the easiest game so prepare for a challenge if you choose Tactician Mode, To conclude, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the best games that came out this year and deserves your attention. Singleplayer or Multiplayer(more fun with the friends of course!), I guarantee that you will have fun."

You also need to pay attention to what's going on, as with the original there is almost no hand holding in classic mode. I my case this lead to me falling back into old habbits and killing everyone that looked at me funny. Due to what appears to be an increased aggro range this has lead to most of the camp now being used to grit the path when it gets icey (i'm guessing this will come back to bite me, but it's fun anyways).

Maridian,67,1,0,October 20,Recommended,77.9,"Highly Recommended 5/5  Myself as a fan of D&D, coming from games like Baldur's Gate I & II: Shadows of Amn, Throne of Bhaal and Enhanced Edtion, IsewindDale, Pillars of Eternity, Neverwinter and many other titles this game was exceptionally good and a breath of fresh air, it is both Dynamic and Immersive, the story is deep, thrilling and intriguing, the characters are full of life and awe, even the side quests are interesting, funny, scary and powerful, the artwork and graphics are beautiful, the music is immersive, dramatic and very appropriate. The game also has a powerful way of making you think and leaves you baffled with the simplest of tasks sometimes and it's amazing how well it works as a whole.  The combat & environments are amazing and take the best of all my past D&D experiences to new levels and excels in ways other games fall short, having the ability to try any skill tree, wear any armour, use any weapon and off hand is amazing and other games i suppose just do not see the power of the possibilities it all offers, giving players the option to be and play exactly how they want to, also giving groups far more  utility and a much better role-play experience. The combat and AI combinations are amazing and synergize so well it can lead to very intense immersive battles that require good communication and well planned tactical combinations between groups to succeed.  To make things better they have incorporated the D&D experience through Game Master Mode allowing players to create their own story and encounters and battles with their own take on the D&D game similar to Tabletop Simulator but of course with a much better gameplay experience, taking things further a full workshop allowing the community to develop their own content including classes, weapons, spells, maps and much more, anything they want to create, they can.  All that together makes this game, in my opinion, the best D&D Coop/Multiplayer style Fantasy RPG of the past 10 years, I cannot find a single fault for this game I have enjoyed it immensely and its only gotten better since playing with groups and developing content for it.  BUY IT! TODAY!!"

All in all this is a fantastic game."
vestul,357,1,0,"December 23, 2016",Recommended,233.7,"Post-Release Review (Updated):  A great sequel to the first. Tactician mode seems quite a bit easier than the original, but there are enough new updates and  additions from the original to make it unique, but still feel just as smooth.  As with the first, the camera is fairly close, and it would be nice to zoom out further but it is what it is. This is pretty much the only criticism I can make. It won't hold your hand; in fact, it does the opposite. You have near-complete freedom to progress as you want and complete tons of side quests, or none at all. Tons of choice and variations in skills/classes/approaches to each situation. Make your own adventure. But buy the game.  10/10 - Game of the Year"
jimelsner,67,1,0,"February 15, 2017",Recommended,180.8,"I liked the early release a lot and have made it most of the way through the first Act in the ""easier"" explorer mode. There is one thing. Even though I have leveled up to 5, along the way, some battles are over the top...unfair. The enemies go first and frequently kill most of your team before you can even start. A good example is the one with the witch Radeka...she has many acolites that retore her and are above you and after 5 tries of no luck, I have given up on the game for now. Maybe the developers will modify these kinds of things. It is no fun to not be able to move along on a game and I have been doing this for 20 years."

ObsceneNameHere,268,1,0,August 10,Recommended,43.0,"I really like this game, the gameplay is awesome Turn Based but doesn't feel slowed down because of that.   Graphics are cool and style reminds me much of that like Champions of Norrath but up-to-date.  Customization is nothing to special when it comes to avatar creation and multiplayer is fun; similar to a D&D feel.  I really wish this had a solid server browser so people can host games and make friends as this would really take off!  Bottom Line: Awesome turn-based game and can be really fun with friends the price tag is at the ceiling for what this is ($45USD)"

jonirenicus,93,1,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,104.2,"Frst reveiw ever on Steam, great work Larian!! Combat system is complex & fun as first D: OS game and even more tactical with new elements such as high grounds. The story & wirting is much much better, pre-made characters & companions are no longer filler dummies but REAL living characters who player will remember. Exploration is vast & full of rich contents & very enjoyable, area design is also much better than the first game which have some serious unblancing issues contentwise(huge 1st act but gets smaller & smaller). D: OS 2 really reminds me much of the old Baldur's Gate series and Dragon Age Origins. Who said that CRPG is a dead genre?  Lastly Larian should really consider making a Chinese Localization. So many Chinese players aren't that good at reading English is yarning for this game."
Gusandoria,183,1,0,"October 22, 2017",Recommended,134.7,This game is the one of the best RPG's I've ever played 10/10. I'm 65 hours in and still going stong.
Rendo,75,1,0,"November 12, 2017",Recommended,289.5,"This review is somewhat limited as I have yet to fully complete the story, nor tried the dnd mode, yet I have a good idea of everything the game has to offer.   I think Larian have done a fantastic job in creating a grounded, well-rounded, and enthralling RPG. The narrative is imagnitive and captivating. Characters and npcs are unique and interesting, with good voice acting they really feel like individuals who each have their own personalilty, some could respond well to charm, others might threaten to kill you. Combat is challenging, fluid, and forces you to stay alert, using your head to figure out the best action to take. The visuals are gorgeous for the type of game it is and help to preserve the verisimiltude of the world.   One thing I would note is that the game is designed to be challenging by nature and is sometimes very slow and frustating, so if you lack patience and prefer only action, it might not be the game for you. For those of us who grew up playing Final Fantasy or other turn-based games, it is a very refreshing reminder of how fun these games can be if done right, especially with the unique twists this title adds. I would fully recommend the game, to the stage I am even using it for a college project where my task is to create an informative video, similar to ones seen by Mark Brown."
Frankie the Frog,133,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,122.6,"This game is easily better than the first. The graphics are impeccable and the voice acting and story continue to amaze me.

TigerAce2712,455,1,2,January 12,Recommended,97.0,"I could literally sit here for hours and talk about how good this game is, but instead I'll just sum it up briefly.  Hands down one of the best games out there. Very good and in depth story. Excellent voice acting and narration. Combat feels fair, and very satisfying. VERY good value for money, this game is very long , so long that I'm still no where near completing it. Dungeon Master mode adds pretty much infinite replayability, though I will say even the regular campaign will do that. Beautiful graphics and amazing soundtrack. Game runs very well, absolutely no performance issues.   Overall, if you like turn based RPG's, or even just RPG's in general, you need to play this. Trust me.  Just be warned that many hours of your life will be absorbed by it.  Score: 9.5/10"

sharang2,101,1,0,"November 10, 2017",Recommended,137.6,"I literally just beat the game as of this afternoon; and spent a couple hours saved just before the ending so I could watch five different ones.  After winning, I'm emotionally exhausted - over the last few weeks and 100 hours playtime, I have developed an unhealthy emotional attachment to my companions.  I dreaded this day; the day I beat the game and would not see my companions again.  Au revoir to the arrogant but stalwart Red Prince, inquisitive Fane, and oh-so fragile Lohse.  In spite of the game's immense replayability thanks to the super catchy character customization and combat options, I will not be loading this up again because I just don't want to go through this emotional roller coaster again.  10/10 would recommend."
Sam,372,1,0,"December 5, 2017",Recommended,71.3,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is by far the best RPG game that I've played this year.  The story is fantastic and changes based on the choices you make, the combat is interesting, and the game is fairly challenging. While in character creation, you are prompted to pick a pre-made origin character or to create your own. I highly recommend using an origin character as all of their dialog is voiced and they have their own unique twist to the overall story. As for the combat, there are almost always ways to interact with your surroundings during a fight whether it be terrain to climb, barrels of oil to burn, or even puddles of water that can be frozen. The combat also gets much harder as you increase the difficulty and really forces you to use your surroundings to your advantage. The only downside to this is that if you're running a cheesy build ranger and rogue each with the lone wolf trait, you can make quick work of almost any enemy from the early-mid-game and on. My biggest gripe about Divinity Original Sin 2 is that things are added automatically to your hot bar as you pick them up or learn a skill. I personally spent 71 hours on my first play through and did quite a few of the side-quests. If you actually read the items that you pick up and do more of the side quests, you could easily get 100+ hours out of one play through. I highly recommend this game to anyone who's into RPG games, especially those with turn-based combat."

Add to that an addictive and satisfying tactical combat system and you ahve one of my favorite games of all time.    Buy it for yourself and for a friend - the multiplayer isn't half bad either.

Gotrek,137,1,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,169.0,"At the cusp of completion.   I think this game has some major drawbacks. One being the difficulty spikes. I am referring always to classic mode for I have not tried any higher. You are doing well, almost a little too easy but nothing rediculous, and then BAM. You are fighting a group that kicks your♥♥♥♥♥so hard your teeth hurt. You reload and adapt and thats fun. But sometimes there is a fight that is just plain unfair.(Not much of a spoiler) There is a boss called Eternal Aetera. This is without a doubt the most rediculously hardest fight in the game so far and I bet the harder than the final. She basicly swamps your team by suprise with a sudden group of phantom wolves. She starts the fight and summons 2 more right on top of you and they attack first. In two or three hits they kill someone or leave them critical. Then she will do several attacks in one turn one of them being a group killer: Hail strike. She has a huge amount of armor and magic armor, and she can keep summoning wolves once killed. I have tried every damn strategy there is. I tried rushing, kiting, charming, status effects. I even tried breaking the dialogue to cheese behind the fight with the pyramids. I must be missing something. I had to lower the difficulty just to beat her. A few fights are this way so I think thats a draw back. I love difficulty and challange but unfairness I cant handle.  Another draw back is the source points. I dont think the magic spells should use up these source points. I think the source skills should because regaining your source is kind of rare. You spend a lot of cash getting these awesome spells you level  and put points in for but you need the damn source to use it.   Another thing I dont like is the limited of AP points. It just feels like it limits the strategy and you do the same battle over and over. Turn 1 you teleport or travel to them. Turn 2 you use your strongest attacks. But with that said it still is very very good and fun. You still get a good dose of strategy too.  One thing I really hate about this game is the cryptic quests. Nothing holds your hand and thats a good thing. But the problem isnt doing the quest, its the completion. The problem I am finding is that so many quests seem to intermingle with eachother that actually turning them in is a god damn mystery. First playthrough on the first chapter: I have done about all the quests I could, but, I didnt know how the hell to turn them in so they left me unrewarded when completing the chapter. I dont know maybe I was just too impatient or not reading carefully. But there are so many cryptic steps to these quests that its overwhelming and annoying.  It's too precise, you must kind of be linear, but there are many ways to go about it. Thats the fun part. But trying to actually turn them in and deciphering which quest is actually what for each pertaining method is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  Oh and there's bugs (current state)  I love the game and highly recomend it. I dont think it's better than the first one. Theres a ton of dialogue with a good portion of it worthless. It's pretty slow. But the game is very long and it's got good graphics, good music, good story, good level up system and good combat system. UI could be better. Cluttery inventory is unavoidable in this game.  If you like the first game you will like this one. The modding community looks really good. But I think the first game is better. Well worth the price."

Except my friends. If you didn't want to die, you should have given me the ring! IT GAVE 2 WIT POINTS! YOU DIDN'T NEED IT! +You can customize your character to a decent degree for an alpha that only sports around 30% of the game's content. +You can turn your tank into the game's scariest kamikaze by lining up oil barrels, wearing a cursed ring and soul shackling yourself to the boss for some hilarious burst damage that leaves crippled enemies floundering around in necrofire. -There isn't enough game to keep me satisfied yet. It has about 2-3 hours of content on Explorer. Ignore this mode ENTIRELY. It makes the game too easy and you end up oneshotting most units. Classic is the right difficulty for beginners in my humble opinion. Even with a party of just 2-3 characters, Classic is entirely doable.  (Advice)  Quickly stat Thievery and aquire Cloak and Dagger for your Thief/Assassin. A good thief can steal tomes from vendors that would otherwise cost over 250 gold for free. Cloak and Dagger is simply the most game-changing move Thieves/Assassins can get. This move is beyond invaluable for a mere 1 AP cost. Self Teleport on a short cooldown that clears away nearby ground effects on use, potentially saving allies nearby you when you teleport away, AND allows you to get to unreachable areas, teleport to those pesky backliners and quickly put you in the position to stun and wreak havoc on the enemy backline. Combined with Teleportation, this gives your Thief/Assassin a crazy amount of control over the battlefield.  Mages should aquire Fossil Strike and some form of AoE fire spell as soon as they can. Having a built in oil barrel makes blocking areas off and burning difficult enemies down quickly so much easier. It also gives you an immense amount of control over the battlefiel with a targetable slow field.  First Aid. This cannot be stressed enough how amazing this Huntsman heal is. It removes every debuff in the game but Cursed and Frozen AND heals a set 30% of hp, making it scale without any of your stat points being tosssed into water magic. It also applies rested.  Necromancers. You want one. Especially if they choose Geomancy as a secondary magical build. The amount of debuffs, self healing and battlefield control they bring is crazy. Blood Rain into Contamination makes the entire battlefield into a poison bog. Add some fire and watch the NPCs panic. Pick Zombie and you will be insanely hard to kill outside of a burst.  (Feedback) I would love to be able to change the instruments in-game AND for each member of the party AND enemies. Being able to do this would be awesome. Enemies could be a more somber or erratic instrument, while my controlled characters would be more vibrant to let me know when it was my turn more clearly. Just a thought~"

Newberg,257,1,0,"October 25, 2017",Recommended,162.1,"Fantastic strategy RPG that doubles as a platform for online D&D.  Pros: -80 to 100 hour campaign -Massive replay value -Fun and creative turn-based strategy combat -Completely free-form leveling system -After the beginning area you can respec all your characters for free forever -Every line of dialogue is voice-acted, complete with an amazing narrator -Comes bundled with a complete creation kit you can use to make mods, maps, and campaigns -Easy to use co-op, plus a GM mode. -You can kill anyone you want. -No forced morality system. -Quests are very creative and usually have different and interesting outcomes.  Cons: -Tactician mode (hard difficulty) requires you to cheese most fights -Usable items you pick up will automatically be placed on your hotbar, cluttering it unless you manually disable that option -Some quests can be bugged if you accidentally do things before the game expected you to. It's never game breaking, but it can be annoying having unfinished quests cluttering your log. -Ambient voice acting gets very annoying, especially if you are at a vendor sorting out your items to sell and you have to hear the same line from nearby NPC's over and over. -Sometimes it's hard to select specific targets if there's a lot of things near eachother, and the slightest movement of your mouse can accidently change your target just as you cast your ability.   All in all, one of the best RPG's to come out in a long time and I highly recommend it."

Bürgermeister,140,1,0,"October 11, 2017",Recommended,129.1,"At first I was hesitant at getting this. It looks great, and like a lot of fun, but maybe not worth the price. I thought maybe I'd pick up the game on a sale or something.  But I'm very glad I got it.  The story is very rich and there's so many ways to play. I'm excited for my second and third play throughs.   You can steal from anybody, kill anyone, befriend NPCs, talk to your followers if you choose to have them, and each story is different from character creation. Each race is treated differently, you have different dialogue options if you're an Outlaw, or Scholar, or even if you play a smart Wizard, you can persuade people with your smarts, or intimidate people with your strength.   The combat is very fun, and comboing spells and attacks is awesome.  Classes aren't really set in stone either. If you're a Fighter but decide you want to shock people, or grow some wings, you can very much do so.   And the GM mode is amazing.   As a Game Master for D&D games, I've always wanted a game to play it in, to immerse the players, and let them explore with out having to explain every small detail. And this game does it very well. You can create custom items, NPCs (even down to what hat they wear), allies, and customize the pre set maps the game gives you. I would honestly buy a DLC that includes more maps. But there are plently right now, I'm just afraid that through multiple play throughs we'll all think ""Oh, this map again.""  This game is a masterpiece, but it's not perfect.  The combat is very hard, even on the easiest difficulty it sometimes feels like I need to kill a couple NPCs who don't deserve it so I can level up and continue the story. And sometimes this makes the game feel linear. I don't know if I'm missing something, or I chose bad classes for my party, but either way that's a big down side for me.  That being said, at the time of posting this review I'm 71 hours in, and I havent even completed my first play through, which is a good thing. I'm taking my time, exploring the world, talking to every NPC and living the world.  UPDATE (very minor spoilers):  I finished the game, and I have to say while the ending was good, it was very buggy. I was unable to use res scrolls, enemies would teleport everywhere, and some other minor things.  Arx also felt very bland for what it could have been. Driftwood and all of Reaper's Coast felt huge, and there was so much story there, but Arx... You were there for one thing, and that was to beat the game. I tried to find more to do there, I tried to find side quests, just anything, but there was nothing. Maybe I missed stuff, maybe I didn't. Either way I feel the game no longer deserves my original score of 8.5/10.  8/10"

The possibilities of problemsolving to almost everything are huge. And of course its played best with some friends who each have their own main character and own questlines.

Gamrage,86,1,0,May 8,Recommended,384.2,"I'm surprised that I haven't written a review of this game since I first started playing it. This game from my own perspective offers quite a bit.   Story: Every single quest has multiple ways of being approached and there is no system of good or evil. You could be doing good thing for terrible people or bad things for noble causes. You could just be pure evil for the sake of being a jerk, and you could make every kindhearted decision out there. There is no wrong choice and anytime you block a certain path due to a choice you made, there is always another option to be explored.  For the amount of choices that this game gives you in terms of social and story progression, it's worth a full price buy in that alone.  Gameplay: Honestly, there is no such thing as a game without bugs. For all the bugs that this game has, it has a devoted team of developers to constantly patch and repair whatever the community reports to them. For every feature the community asks of the devs, they take everything into careful consideration. The combat mechanics are simple and complex at the same time. Every attack has it's own property, physical or magic. Physical damage has no sub categories while magic damage splits into, fire, water, earth, poison and wind. What makes the magical damage so complex is how the elements interact with each other and the environment to make the gameplay more immersive.   Unfortunately, if you want to play the game for pure optimization and not immersion, most people go into pure physical damage builds to ignore the majority of elemental immunities that certain enemies might have in the game.  To sum it up, the game is great and worth more than it sells for."

The last game was great, but they removed the ability to destroy the game easily and made it much more difficult, especially in the beginning, and it requires character specialization.

Brave the world in any way you want, be it killing everyone and everything you see moving, sneaking and pickpocketing around or tricking NPCS with your persuasion skills. Combat is very dynamic, with a single spell able to completely transform the battlefield. For example, if I use Rain and then cast a fireball on a water puddle between my party and my enemies, the steam cloud will obscure their vision, forcing hand-to-hand combat. The story is well developed and Origin characters integrate seamlessly with the world and its characters. D:OS2 has my Seal of Approval!"

So I keep playing without refund.  It's when I get to the first map 'Fort Joy' that I start to understand why this game so highly praised.  1. 99% Npc in this game is not useless, it not just stand there repreat the same boring dialogue. There is so many event/secret that can happen by talking to them.  2. 'Every Npc have voice acting!' even those damn rats! This is crazy.  3. Story is not linear. So many way to play this game.  4. Graphics is amazing for old computer. I was worry that my old computer wouldn't able to run graphics as beautiful as they show in screenshot, but my game look like their screenshot with Medium setting.    AMD HD Radeon 6770 AMD Phenom II X4 970 8 GB  5. You don't have to worry about other Hero's level that didn't join your party, because eveyone will always have the same level. This is a really good system, it give you a freedom to choose any Heroes you want to join party without have to worry that their level will get too low and you have to stuck with this companions that you get bored of them.  6. After finished Chapter.1 you'll able to 'Modify your Hero's Status' This is really good, because we'll always ♥♥♥♥ed up our character because we're still new to this game.

FireFox Bancroft,360,1,0,January 24,Recommended,15.8,"This game does not hold your hand. Remiscent of older AD&D CRPG's. You control a small 4-player party Baldur's Gate-style around a big world map. Each character in your party has unique skills and abilities. Learn them, train them, master them. You can only have four (4) characters in your party so choose wisely.  Expect brutally and sometimes unfair dice-roll turn-based combat. As for questing, again, don't expect any hand-holding, you either figure things out on your own or you look up a walkthrough. Your quest journal is light on hints as well. They DO give hints but they only give you a nudge in the right direction. NPC conversations contain more detailed hints so you have to really pay attention to what they're saying. Oh and important NPC's CAN die and mess up your progress and you will either have to find another way to complete a quest or reload a previous save. Or just live with the death of that NPC and move on. And speaking of saving, this is a game where you either save-scum or you live with the consequences of your choices.  I can recommend this to hardcore CRPG players who are looking for fun and a challenge. I can't recommend it for RPG-lite players who are used to thinbgs like Oblivion or Skyrim.  My overall assesment of this game is: ""Brutally challenging and interesting without being difficult for difficluty's sake like Dark Souls"""

I started playing on tactician, and yeah, some fights really suck but it makes it all the better when you win them and get sick♥♥♥♥♥loot. The armor system is interesting. It took some getting used to but it's a pretty decent system when you think about it. The combat is phenomenal and has only improved since DOS1. Origin characters have great story behind them and everybody has their own motives and goals. Whether you work together or not is decided by how you play. All in all, This game is badass and I'm only 1/4 of the way through. I have noticed bugs here and there but I haven't experienced anything game breaking. When these are patched this game is an easy 11/10.  TL;DR: This game is a gem of an RPG. It doesn't hold your hand and that's one of the main reasons it's damn good.

hornhollow,650,1,0,"October 1, 2017",Recommended,83.7,"I just finished my first playthrough last night. Let's get this out of the way: this game is something special. It improves on almost every gripe I had with the original (mainly just story and pacing) and just knocks it out of the park. This is a new gold standard for what a modern RPG should be.    What's Good The companions are memorable, well-written, and have realistic motivations that make negotiating their place in your party really engaging as you strive for the end-goal of the game. (I mean, it makes sense, you can play them as the main character if you wish!)  Combat rewards creativity, exploration, and experimentation without ever feeling like it's unfair towards the player--some fights are tough as nails, but they're just puzzles that you've been given an entire toolbox to solve. It's incredible just how many viable strategies you can employ to build a party and the myriad tactical decisions you can make in combat with those interactions.  Some of the quests and puzzles are pretty inspired--I'm a DM for tabletop group and I can appreciate how hard it is to make a puzzle that's challenging and feels organic to its context while delivering on fun. So hard to do, and 90% of the quests and puzzles in D:OS2 deliver. The quests often have multiple paths to resolution, which can be incredibly satisfying.    (Minor) Gripes I only encountered a few bugs over the course of my game and none of them were show-stopping. (A few dialogue options that didn't make sense because of my choices; quicksave reload breaking a script in combat and requiring rollback; a few quests not updating / reflecting change after I made major progress in them.) The lion's share of these happened in the last two major areas of the game--which I totally understand given the sheer scope of the game.   Long story short: there hasn't been an RPG this rich in a long time. It's worth every penny of the price tag."
Jio,19,1,0,"October 22, 2017",Recommended,85.0,"My Lord , what a game.... i have to admit i was cautious when i bought it, i wasnt entirely sure i would be pleased. Oh boy, the game is 1. Endless, an aspect that we have forgotten in rpg games aside from witcher series~ 2. Non repetitive , full of flavor . Nothing has to be done in a certain why, at a certain time, its your story and you do it your way 3. Demanding, even in the easiest mode , the game requires effort, which i personally love , i grew tired of games that are too easy ! 4. Re-playable, now i have almost 40 hours by the time i do this review, iam currently at 15% completion, and i already know i will replay the game when iam done with it because there are so many things that i missed when i started ( which is normal for such a huge game) , now that means that the game offers 150++ hours of entartainment!!!! When other games such as Shadow of war are at 80 hours Max( and cost 15$ higher ) , what more could you be asking from a gaming company?  In summary: iF you enjoyed the witcher series as much as i did and , you love rpg games with items, puzzles, explorations, and dialogue--->or and you are a DND fan ,this game ... is a BUY IT!! The only type of group that i wouldnt suggest this , are for people that do not enjoy a slow heart warming building expierience, the ones that prefer a 60 hour come in come out kind of game."

Without the superb, AAA voice acting I would have found myself less invested in the game. The narration and storytelling is absolutely inticing. The sheer amount of detail in this game is... almost shocking. Everywhere you walk there is something new to loot or a new story to tell. This is NOT a half-a**ed game, truely a masterpiece. If you are even a hair interested in RPG/Strategy games, you have to try D:OS2. Goes to show you that you don't need a $60 pricetag for a GOTY worthy adventure!  Only in D:OS2 you will find yourself asking a sickly NPC in an outhouse if they're okay.  I just spent my /entire day/ clawing tooth and nail trying to escape a single dungeon.

❀ Nes ❀,142,1,0,August 25,Recommended,155.4,"Let me start off by saying that I don't normally write reviews for games unless they are exceptional. This game lies in one of the few exceptions where I have to.  I bought this game when it first released but I didn't have a good computer to actually fully enjoy it. Fast forward to recently when I did buy one and I fully spent the time to play this game. At first, it seemed difficult for me as I never played the first Divinity and tried to learn my way around the game. Not that long after, I got familiar with the story and the lore. From someone who doesn't enjoy care about the plot of most RPG's or MMORPG's, this game somehow brought the story forward for me to be interested in. I personally built an attatchment to my character and my companions as we continued on this adventure through Divinity. It was an amazing experience and that was when I knew what a gem this game was.  Some of the elements that I found compelling about this game was:   The voice acting - The many actors who portrayed the characters in this game did not disappoint. At times, I was just shocked at the amount of emotion and passion placed into each line of dialogue. My personal favorite was the voice actor for Lohse, whom I felt went above and beyond what some would just skim past. Also a big round of applause to those actors who put themselves out there to voice each animal or dungeon rat that was available throughout the game.   The combat - The understanding of many tactical aspects of each combat situation made it harrowing for me, in a fun sort of way. It was fun to experiment different strategies to clear a particular room of enemies or be faced with decisions that could affect whether or not my party makes it out of combat alive. The high-ground/low-ground system made it particularly mindful to pay attention to your surroundings while the natural elemental occurences (such as oil, poison, fire, etc,) keep you on your toes.   The storytelling - As stated in the above paragraph, the story is phenomenal. I found myself always wondering what would happen next and how my actions would affect the world down the line. It was truly one of the times where I found myself relating to my character, as if I were them rather than me controlling them. I truly loved the way the world was set up and how mostly everything had some role to play either in the narrative of the story or just to contribute to the feel of the world.   The world - Speaking of the feel of the world, everything was how it should be to establish a world that felt dynamic and alive. NPC's truly made their experiences feel real with some having problems that seemed normal and how they were portrayed. I sometimes imagined the theoretical lives of these NPC's and treated them as if they were real people with their own past experiences. When a game can make you engrossed into their world, you know it is good.   Music - The music was excellent at many areas and shifts according to the environment that you were placed in. Dungeons or naturally spooky areas had a feeling of dread but the suspensful and harrowing music helped contribute to the feel of this.  The music that played during the ending fight actually had me tearing up as even though it was something that I heard so many times, knowing that this was final area made it truly special and evoked a lot of memories and emotions of the overall adventure   Overall, I had just finished my first campaign and am planning on finishing more as to learn more about the companions that I did not choose at first and to see all the possible routes that I can go through before I eventually clear up the game. The game's amazing and a big thanks for Larian Studios for putting out such a masterpiece. I can't wait for the Definitive Edition to come out but until then, there are many mods and more to keep you continuously entertained. 10/10"
Zmay,45,1,0,April 27,Recommended,62.0,"Amazing game, all around, amazing gameplay, story, music, grafics, decision making, difficulty. In my eyes it's a solid 9/10 the only negativ thing I can think of is, that on higher difficultys you need to play specific comps to beat the game and the end falls a bit flat."
Crixxz,107,1,0,January 23,Recommended,272.0,"Sunk 270+ hours into this, and there is probably more coming in.  Storyline is top-notch, OST is absolutely exhilirating, voice acting is professional quality... Gameplay & combat will speak for itself in no time after you sink a few hours into it.  I can't really find much negatives; other than a few buggy quest entries & achievements still hanging around. The game never once crashed on me, and that's saying a lot given how much time I had it running. The whole thing is a gigantic success; which I suspect owes this highly to the good community input during the early access.  If you are the type to save/load a lot (hmmm pickpockets...), I'd highly recommend running this on SSD to avoid longer wait times.  If you like a good RPG, the price-per-hour value of this game is immense. Go buy it."

matt.w.collins,18,1,0,"August 24, 2017",Recommended,255.9,"(This is the first time I have reviewed a game for Steam)  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is, in my opinion, an instant classic.  It is similar to other games such as Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale.  I have played through much of the first part of the Fort and I am having a great time.  The graphics are amazing.  The soundtrack is enchanting.  The overall mechanics of the game are seamless.  I would recommend this game to all lovers of the fantasy genre and to those who enjoy turn-based combat games.  Many of the fights you encounter will seem hopeless, but with some strategy and patience, you will prevail."
MrStealYourMemes69,150,1,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,71.5,"A vast improvement compared to the first (DOS:EE) installment of the modern series.  Pros: - In-depth turn based combat system - Beautiful visuals, both in and out of combat - Deep lore in relation to the world that you explore and the characters that inhabit it - Multiple ways to go about accomplishing a central objective - Origin characters with a rich backstory exist along custom player-made characters - Replayability is present for 2 or 3 playthroughs in total as long as you don't get bored of the main story - Infinite respeccing options allowing you to completely change each of your characters on the fly with no penalty     whatsoever - Magnificent soundtrack and audio work  Cons: - Although an improvement compared to DOS:EE, the game at times is still fairly unintuitive (looking at you, Arx) - Some minor bugs pose an equally minor annoyance (some characters keep infinitely looping dialogue, audio bugs) - Very lackluster ending - Unable to go back to previous areas after having moved on to the next act / area - Unable to free roam and tie off any loose ends after completeing the game    Conclusion:DOS:2 is a very fun game that I find was worth the money that I've invested into it. I bought it the moment it came out of early access and have sunk a total of 64 hours into it. You can definitely sink more time into this (around 75 or 80 hours total maybe) if you go around and finish every side quest and origin character questline. As I've already mentioned it's a shame that we can't go back and freeroam all of the areas once we finish the game. This was an issue in DOS:EE as well and it's sad to see that the same problem persists here. Either way I must give credit to Larian for a near flawless second installment. If you're on the fence about buying this game I would advise you to wait for the winter sale and see if it drops in price, and if it doesn't, then buy it anyway. The price will not change from $45."

vkylemon,32,1,0,March 22,Recommended,187.2,"This is overall a really good game, I have played lots of RPG's and this is one of those that stays in your memory.   PROS:  - Excellent artwork - Amazing soundtrack and voice acting - Lots of details - Well written dialogues - Companions are useful and interesting  CONS:  - Last act looks a bit too rushed - Minor bugs, probably fixed by now - Crafting feels unfinished in some recipes but it is pretty extense  FULL REVIEW:  It has amazing artwork and an outstanding amount of details that you just can't overlook.   The dialogue is another thing that is really well written, it contains easter eggs, fun jokes and serious or sensitive  lines that will hit you, that goes hand in hand with the voice acting and sound track.  The story stays consistent and it is well made, no matter your choices you won't see a decrease in quality  (I had several saves).  As a bad point I can say the last act looks and feels a bit rushed. Also I have encountered several tiny bugs, but they didn't really trouble me while playing.  The crafting part to me looks lacking, I had several things that couldn't find on any wiki, reddit or similar how to use them or they were kind of useless.  I was not really fond of the armor design (some looked too huge, or they had outstanding stats and looked like plain clothes), or the fact that you have dyes but cannot change the armour color in any way, but maybe that's planned (?).   So my final review is really positive over all of the cons I found, I think It's still worth playing 100%. "
Mr Chicken,149,1,0,January 8,Recommended,48.3,"Pros: Fully voice acted Flexible character design system which allows you to mix and match your classes. Great music Great graphics Long campaign with different ways to complete objectives GM mode  Cons: No fog of war - I can see everything around the map despite being 10km away For a co-op game it seems to force/favour PvP.  The crossbows use a different mechanic to the 1st game. Now they are identical to bows and have no differences. In the 1st game they were stronger but used more AP, why'd they make them the same as bows? Some things in-game are quite immersion breaking. Why do guards in the 1st act not act/realise that I have removed my collar? How does Dallis' new ship sneak up and board The Lady Vengence? Some of these annoyances are rather miniscule however."

Shyrahja,146,1,0,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,95.2,"I am unsure where to begin with Divinity 2 at this point. This game has been and still is an amazing journey you can take on alone or with your friends.  I am hardly convinced with most of the games I play but Divinity has me on a collar. I cannot look away or stop playing it. I already am at 50H and haven't even experienced the whole singleplayer campaign.   The fact that you can talk with every single NPC, including animals (if you got the ""Pet Pal"" Talent early on), that you can explore every corner, find new clues and ways to secret caves or find treasure chests. All those aspects are a big yes for me to recommend Divinity2.   But was that all? Hell no. I haven't even covered 20 percent of what this game is capable of yet! I really enjoy freedom. I want to choose what to do, how to do it and, that should I take the wrong path in a conversation, have to deal with the backfire. Each race reacts differently towards NPC's (as do they. A lot of racism going on in this game) while adding more tags to your character such as ""Barbarian""""Scholar""""Outlaw""""Mystic""""Soldier""""Jester"" and ""Noble"" gives you the options to get more information out of them or successfully persuing them after they saw you stealing. (I have to add this since it caused me great pain. Do NOT click on a trader while they are walking by. I accidentally stole a bottle of wine instead of talking to the trader and hell on earth broke out. Never steal wine guys. NEVER.)   Each races armor looks different depending on what armor you give them. The same helmet looks differently for each race which means just getting out all the armor sets probably took ages and I am glad they put so much detail and work in this game. You can see the development teams heart in it. A great game that is meant to be so much more.  It is sometimes hard to keep the playerbase or even raise those numbers shouldn't there be options to replay the game after ""finishing"". Divinity did everything right. I am putting the word ""finish"" like this simply because of the fact that you will be having a hard time completing this game 100% if not impossible. So many options depending on what you chose while creating your character, while talking, whom you talk too and how. So many options to go, so much to explore, so many ways you can complete a single quest will make it hard for you to not get lost in this wonderful world <3  And I haven't even started to talk about the Game Master aspect. So far I have't been able to look at them simply because of the fact that the moment I have freetime I play the campaign.... I might be addicted at this point.  The option to create your own campaign, invite your friends or upload your work on Divnity's Steam Workshop will give you a never ending adventure.  My friendgroup started to use Divinity as DnD platform. Our GM creates the world and through Divinity you don't need to only imagine it, you can actually see and play your personal adventure.  Since the game is turn based you have everything a little RP heart needs to be happy.   In short: If you enjoy exploring, a never ending adventure and have a great time with your friends while playing Divnity's campaign, a downloaded one from the workshop or your own this is the game for you to play.  A long awaited tripple A game that has been worth all the wait. Hands up for an amazing adventure I will be enjoying for a long time!"

I've only played for about 16 hours so far and already I can see how vast the game is, how my choices have affected me thus far, and how I even wish I could start over knowing what I know now.

New additions are the choice of making your own character or choosing a pre-set one with variations on back story. There are significantly more spells and skills than before and you also have physical and magical armour. Being able to gain an advantage on the battlefield using height is a welcome addition. However, where I feel it is inferior to the first is the humour, there seems less in the sequel and I didn't care much for the playable characters.

A couple weird things happen and there many ways to exploit some systems but I think they will be patched out soon. Very good game for those rainy fall days..
Gotrek,137,1,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,169.0,"At the cusp of completion.   I think this game has some major drawbacks. One being the difficulty spikes. I am referring always to classic mode for I have not tried any higher. You are doing well, almost a little too easy but nothing rediculous, and then BAM. You are fighting a group that kicks your♥♥♥♥♥so hard your teeth hurt. You reload and adapt and thats fun. But sometimes there is a fight that is just plain unfair.(Not much of a spoiler) There is a boss called Eternal Aetera. This is without a doubt the most rediculously hardest fight in the game so far and I bet the harder than the final. She basicly swamps your team by suprise with a sudden group of phantom wolves. She starts the fight and summons 2 more right on top of you and they attack first. In two or three hits they kill someone or leave them critical. Then she will do several attacks in one turn one of them being a group killer: Hail strike. She has a huge amount of armor and magic armor, and she can keep summoning wolves once killed. I have tried every damn strategy there is. I tried rushing, kiting, charming, status effects. I even tried breaking the dialogue to cheese behind the fight with the pyramids. I must be missing something. I had to lower the difficulty just to beat her. A few fights are this way so I think thats a draw back. I love difficulty and challange but unfairness I cant handle.  Another draw back is the source points. I dont think the magic spells should use up these source points. I think the source skills should because regaining your source is kind of rare. You spend a lot of cash getting these awesome spells you level  and put points in for but you need the damn source to use it.   Another thing I dont like is the limited of AP points. It just feels like it limits the strategy and you do the same battle over and over. Turn 1 you teleport or travel to them. Turn 2 you use your strongest attacks. But with that said it still is very very good and fun. You still get a good dose of strategy too.  One thing I really hate about this game is the cryptic quests. Nothing holds your hand and thats a good thing. But the problem isnt doing the quest, its the completion. The problem I am finding is that so many quests seem to intermingle with eachother that actually turning them in is a god damn mystery. First playthrough on the first chapter: I have done about all the quests I could, but, I didnt know how the hell to turn them in so they left me unrewarded when completing the chapter. I dont know maybe I was just too impatient or not reading carefully. But there are so many cryptic steps to these quests that its overwhelming and annoying.  It's too precise, you must kind of be linear, but there are many ways to go about it. Thats the fun part. But trying to actually turn them in and deciphering which quest is actually what for each pertaining method is a huge pain in the♥♥♥♥♥  Oh and there's bugs (current state)  I love the game and highly recomend it. I dont think it's better than the first one. Theres a ton of dialogue with a good portion of it worthless. It's pretty slow. But the game is very long and it's got good graphics, good music, good story, good level up system and good combat system. UI could be better. Cluttery inventory is unavoidable in this game.  If you like the first game you will like this one. The modding community looks really good. But I think the first game is better. Well worth the price."

If you want to destroy the whole town you're in, you can.  If you want to teleport past an entire area you can.  Oh you feel like you're cheating the game by being where you are?  Jokes on you, Larian thought of this and put loot over here for you, or an entire fight or quest line.  The concept of ""play the game how you want"" is so strong here it's almost overwhelming.  On top of that, the quality of the game is amazing as well.  Every line is voice acted, the writing is great, puzzles are well thought out, combat is satisfying, abilties are rewarding.  Everything just shouts passion when you play it.  Definately a recommendation, even at full price."

That said, there are still minor bugs involved like portrait problems after using mirror(don't google this, spoiler) and invisible enemies upon loading mid-battle. Though far from game-breaking, it does well to bother. But such a great triple A game for the current price? GET IT. It definitely stands side by side with the recent -- recent being two years back -- top titles that you still have a clear memory of.

FunkyBuddha,167,1,0,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,63.7,"The game starts a little rough/boring when you're on the ship (I did not like it at all), but after that short area the game slowly opens up and before you know it you have been absorbed into it. The attention to detail (all animals are voiced but you only talk to them if you spend a point on the required ability), the flexibility that your abilities come with opens up many options for battles and exploration that is mostly limited by your imagination, and the little hand holding when it comes to exploration (you must talk and explore around instead of waiting for ! marks and waypoints) allows for a greater immersion. I got this game not expecting much outside of a regular RPG, but what I got was an old school DnD-esque game with a lot of depth and ♥♥♥♥ me if that's not something that we haven't seen in ages. If you liked games like Baldurs Gate and the more recent Pillars of Eternity then this game will grab a hold of you and never let you go."

Add to that an addictive and satisfying tactical combat system and you ahve one of my favorite games of all time.    Buy it for yourself and for a friend - the multiplayer isn't half bad either.  That might be underselling it a bit too; the multiplayer allows two or more people to explore the story without stepping all over each other and without one player feeling left out or uninvolved.

JOHN BUTTMADDEN,261,1,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,201.0,"Do you like strategic roleplaying games like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Arcanum, Fallout 1 & 2, Dragon Age (the first one), or XCOM 2?  Well, you're going to love this.  This game combines the roleplaying depth of Dungeons & Dragons with a strategic feeling similar to XCom 2. Practically speaking, what this means is that outside of combat, you can do damn well near anything you can think of. In combat, you can do the same. If you want to break into that house, kill that lady, steal that gold, and escape into the night, you can. If you want to be the daring hero, and save shackled stowaways on a sinking ship, you can. This game gives you the freedom to truly explore the ""RP"" factor of Roleplaying games. Very few games these days can hold a candle to the amount of roleplaying this game encourages.   I think a number of groups of Dungeons and Dragons players will likely abandon tradtional and even virtual play, and just move their games over to Divinity: Original Sin 2. It's easy to learn, hard to master - not unlike D&D - and it's also aesthetically gorgeous in both music and graphics. Can't recommend this game enough. Buy it."

Ahriman,237,1,0,July 28,Recommended,57.9,"I found the story as well as the voice acting in certain parts cheesy. I didn't play any previous games, so I might not be fit to judge the story but that's the impression I got. It didn't really bother me though, maybe they were going for the old school cliché RPG story.   The funnest part of the game is the countless ways you can tackle quests or objectives. I'm not a big fan of turn-based combat but the one in DOS2 really did it for me. It's challenging and the way you and enemies can interact with the environment (for example wet ground) is really awesome and leads to alot of funny moments co-op.   Every side quest felt unique and it didn't feel like I was doing anything pointless.   The RPG elements are implemented amazingly well. I was impressed by how much your civil abilities, attributes, race as well as the backgrounds you chose at the start (Scholar, Jester, Noble..) of the game affect your dialogue options and ways you can do quests. The game doesn't tie you down when it comes to character builds and there are lots of interesting skills you can combine and play around with. The one thing I didn't like so much was the lack of armor variation for races other than humans, they all look kind of the same to me.  I played through the whole game in co-op which made the experience much more enjoyable. If you can find a friend who's willing to play with you from beginning to end it's tons of fun. I also have a save where I started a playthrough with an NPC companion (Fane). I was pleasantly surprised by how much depth NPC companions have. They have their very own storyline that which you completely miss out on if you don't make them join your party.  I recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a decent RPG, even people who prefer action RPGs."

The Fleshining,114,1,0,July 3,Recommended,69.7,"Have you ever asked yourself what would happen if they could make D&D into an actual videogame? Well look no further! I've been on the fence about buying this game for a while, I finally picked up this game on sale and I'm so far 17 hours into playing this game. All I can say is this may be the greatest RPG I have ever played. Does it have the greatest graphics? No. It is mouse click controls as opposed to WASD. This game more than makes up for all of that with the richness of it's story and lore. In additition the character customization as well as the sheer amount of decisions you can make to complete a quest are vast and astounding. For a game that is not that graphics intense it is still 26 GB and you can see where all that memory goes. You can talk to every single NPC and animal (if you have that skill) in this world and they all have a voice you can actually listen to. You can kill any NPC you want but keep in mind that everything has a consequence in this game. Combat is interesting and again, depending on what skills you have, can be approached in multiple ways depending on the challenge. You can be a ranger with wings, fly up to the high ground and have a tactical advantage. Have a battlemage, shock the most powerful foe, stun lock him while the rest of your party kills all the others. Be a rogue and give every enemy the suprise buttsecks.... everything is a possibility in this game. If you have looked at the game description and been intrigued but maybe not convinced to buy this game, don't even think about it just buy it. You will get your money's worth. This is a game I see myself replaying multiple times in the future."
Delu,705,1,0,August 4,Recommended,70.1,"The game is simply amazing and that is pre upcoming Definitive Edition extensive Update.   One thing I would like to see changed/ revised is that often when you get into cinematic style close up conversations, the NPC you talk to is visually cut off in odd places, usually the head. So you happen to talk to a lot of headless NPC's and a large portion of the screen is filled with Text, so instead of listening and enjoying the view often there is an accidental forced focus on that text and only little visible parts of NPC's at odd angles. If it actually works right on the other hand you see the usually bland facial expression of NPC's but still a large portion of the screen is covered with text. It feels like this could be done better in both cases as it disctracts a lot.  Otherwise an amazing game I highly recommend playing."

[TT] Valentinus570,175,1,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,121.1,"It's a great game !  I got the feeling that I played a good old paper RPG like D&D: no proper ""classes"" (you mix your own), lots of characters, speeches, way to fight, ...  BUT it's definetly not for everyone. It's like you have a sadistic GM: it's tactical, it's hard, it's unforgiving. Prepare for looots of quicksaves, or you'll live with the consequence of your acts Wrong move ? Dead. Wrong answer to a pnj ? Dead. No characters with this ability ? Quest almost impossible to do  Exemple: (very very light spoiler ahead)  I could talk to a Scarecrow: i start the discussion, and then there was NO way, at least for my character as i build it, to avoid the fight with 10 scarecrow 2 level above of me -> F8 to last quicksave	  For those who know/liked the 1st opus: run for it ! Same base, but everything is enhanced, with a lot of quality of live changes, etc ...  I highly recommend for anyone who like hardcore tactical RPG. Btw, the 1st opus is absolutly not needed, for lore-lover, a quick wikipedia summary is enough.  -----------------------------------------  C'est un super jeu !  J'ai vraiment eu l'impression de jouer à un RPG papier oldschool genre D&D: pas réellement de classes (on construit celle qu'on veut), beaucoup de personnages, de dialogues, d'actions possibles ...  MAIS, c'est pas un jeu accessible/plaisant pour tous. Comme dit plus haut, c'est comme avoir un MJ sadique: c'est très stratégique, très dur et impardonnable. Préparez-vous à souvent faire des quicksaves, ou alors vous vivrez avec les conséquences irrémédiables de vos actes. Faux mouvement ? Mort. Mauvais réponse ? Mort. Aucun personnage avec telles compétences ? Quète quasi-impossible.  Exemple: (très très léger spoiler)  Je pouvais parler avec un épouvantail, je lance donc le dialogue, à partir de là, il n'y avait AUCUN moyen, pour mon personnage tel que je l'avais construit, d'éviter le combat avec 10 épouvantails 2 niveaux au dessus de moi -> F8 vers la dernière sauvegarde rapide	  Pour ceux qui connaissent/ont aimé le 1er opus: prenez sans hésiter ! C'est la même base, mais tout est amélioré, avec beaucoup de modification ""quality of live"" , etc ...  Je recommande vraiment pour tous les fans de RPG ou tactical game un peu hardcore. Au fait, le 1er opus n'est absolument pas nécéssaire, pour les puristes, un rapide résumé wikipédia est suffisant."

Willvasco,183,1,0,July 9,Recommended,74.1,"I am not someone who enjoys isometric RPGs. I love the likes of the later Fallouts, Elder Scrolls, and other first-person action RPGs, but never things like Pillars of Eternity or older isometrics. I am also not a fan of turn based combat, I find it slow and often boring and difficult to pull off well, the only game where this is not the case for me is XCOM. So when my friends kept telling me I needed to play Divinity: Original Sin 2, that it is everything I've ever wanted, I found it hard to believe. It seemed to be the antithesis of what I enjoyed, and on top of that it was more expensive than any game I've purchased in the past three years and I didn't want to take a gamble on it.  That lasted for a couple of months until the summer sale where the game was on sale for $35 and I was looking to spend money so I said what the hell. If I didn't like it, I could always refund it within two hours of game time.  Don't get this game on sale. Get it at the most expensive possible price to give the developers as much money as you can because god damn do they deserve it.  The combat system that I thought I would hate is exactly what I expected, but is nearly perfect along the lines of how XCOM's systems are near perfect. The creativity allowed for in planning encounters around environmental hazards and playing the terrain and elements to you benefit is infinitely entertaining and allows for some truly memorable moments to arrise from seemingly meaningless fights. The isometric view and movement took some getting used to and still is annoying from time to time when it comes to interior environments, but after a couple hours it becomes second nature like any other game.   The absolute, main golden goose of this game is its storytelling. There has not been a game with better storytelling since the Witcher 3 and Divinity even knocks that out of the water. Not in its main overarching story, mind. That in and of itself is wonderous and expansive beyond imagining, nor in its world building that somehow manages to make tolkein-esque fantasy feel fresh and unique without feeling gimicky. But where Divinity really shines is in its moment-to-moment encounters. Almost every single character in the world is given a name and backstory, and all of them are suprisingly deep. Even the animals are given names, stories, personalities and quests, some of which are hilarious and some of which are absolutely heartbreaking, all locked behind one trait you might not even pick.   This is the great beauty of DOS2, the absolutely stunning density of its storytelling and the unbelievable nature of its originality. With something like this it is very easy for quests and stories to become repetitive and boring, but somehow DOS2 manages to keep them all fresh and inventive with characters that you truly, achingly care for even though you've only just met them.   You will get sucked into the world of DOS2, and you'll stay there until you finish it even while you aren't playing. I thought I wouldn't like this game, and even though I am barely halfway done with it it is already one of my favorite games of all time. If you're on the fence, get off that fence and play it. If you aren't interested, rethink your priorities. This game is a modern masterpiece and it will be remembered for years to come."

Zaareish,94,1,0,"December 27, 2017",Recommended,147.1,"A delightfully fresh game (Fresh meat's back on the menu boys!)  This game is one of the best CRPGs you'll ever play, however there are some design issues that are objectively awful.  Random loot, sure it sounds like a stock-standard idea. Randomized loot. but it gets irritating swapping out old stuff with the new every level on all four characters. Trying to remember who needs a new piece of equipment and checking every time is a whole lot of 'belgh.'  Instead of having so much focus on the differnce that levels and equipment makes, why not put it on making unique armors and weapons? There are already exsisting unique items, but they're useless because you're always getting something better. A focus on tactical gameplay rather than numbers, because it's only ever tactical when the enemy is a level above you or there's a load of them kicking thy butt.   That's my biggest gripe.   Spells are fun and the interactivity is novel and satisfying at first, but by act three the player should understand the rather simple mechanics.   Combat, now I liked the combat at first. Then the fights started getting longer, and watching characters cast the same spell and seeing same damn animation everytime really begins to grind on one's nerves. Why not speed up the animations? Or have an option to do that? Why do I have to sit here and watch ten enemies stroll around and take five seconds (the approx time spent casting a single spell) to cast each of their spells.   Crafting blows harder than stormy daniels. I'm not going to carry all that stuff in any of my inventories. Organizing is a chore, so I just get rid of everything except my potions and lotions.   Quests are neat, and the devs know that players will, can, and may do whatever they want to win fights. Break the game. The game is self-aware. It parodies itself and the genre. Sneak mode (haha), and numerous other things I can't remember."

Vinny Vally,205,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,65.5,"Awesome!  So me and 3 of my mates are playing the campaign together - Each of us for the first time so it's all fresh and fun!  Last night we were attacking a group on a balcony which drew aggro from 3 below - There were 2 stairways up to us, one directly and one that went ALL the way around the balcony.  Within a turn or two, two of the guys at the bottom start running up to us. On the close stairway I cast rain and lightning it, stunning the two. After the lightning effect wears off, I oiled a portion of the area and slowed them down. During this time, we finish of most of the enemies up high. The third guy however walked in circles at the bottom seemingly ignoring us...  After a turn or two more, the 2 guys on the stairs reached myself so I teleported one of them back to the bottom to give us some extra time. When I did this, the third guy STILL at the bottom decided to ATTACK his own TEAMMATE to heal himself!! He was on full health!! He just attacked poor Timothy for no reason hahaha!!  Sooooo, a few turns later, the second guy had run back up the stairs and we'd dealt with him and all the others. Just the third guy remaining... He, who obviously wanted no part in this fight, had decided to, for whatever reason, to go up the other stairs and ALLLLLLLL the way around...  So, we decided to set a plan of ambush - Because at this point we were all laughing and just mocking this particular guy anyway - So we all gathered on the balcony that the path led to just around a corner, except for our support guy who stood right at the back of the path.. I set a layer of ice, and some oil, and then we just skipped turns for him to run to us.  Finally, one turn away, JUST around this corner we could see him. I froze the poor guy, and someone else warmed him up just to toy with him. We were all laughing given how long it took for him to get there... HIS TURN!! FINALLY!! We figured we'd let him hit just one of us just because.. But no!! What's this?? He's run past me... And my friend... And another... And then past 2 minions... Where's he going?!?! hahahaha. He ran directly at the support guy but ran out of AP and just stood next to him thinking for a while, then passed his go! Hahahaha!! He'd just about made it around the entire balcony when we finally killed him..  God damn that was funny!! Cannot wait till we're all online tonight :D    Basically the same game as the first but with improvements in skills, choices, graphics, etc. Highly recommended!"

xace,56,1,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,65.8,"One of the best games I have ever played.  Several bugs and lack of features make it fall just short of that #1 however.  My main concerns are in multiplayer. You have to play as the hosts party characters and not your own. That means playing an archer with a level 2 bow, all stats in wits and other useless talents. There is also an endless amount of bugs with multiplayer. For example, if I am host and start a multiplayer and someone joins me as say The Red Prince and I save, restart whatever, that character then becomes bugged. Instead of reverting back to The Red Prince after that player leaves, he bears that persons name and is unable to be reset, or even dismissed. You normally can talk to npc's in your party and say you want to go your seperate ways and recruit another party member, nope. bugged.  Another example is I use one of my npc's for dialect options since they have persuasion stats and my main is undead. Someone joined the game and took control of MY character and when I leveled up he butchered his stats and skills and those remained on my character after I kicked him and / or restarted the game.  These things make multiplayer extremely frustrating and have forced me to start brand new games probably about 6 times now. I haven't even been able to get through act 1. I am very wary to play in multiplayer due to all these reasons and despite preferring multiplayer in it's theory am forced to play single player to avoid game breaking bugs like those i mentioned. I wish I could provide some feedback or get some kind of bug fix on this bug I don't see an option for that. Thankfully the developer is very involved in the game and will probably fix this at some point. I am now hoping that a user created mod will fix many of these issues in the future (thank god this game has mods)  Despite all my frustrations this game is absolutely incredible in every other aspect. Everything is voiced, every npc which is amazing. Graphics are good (not great) especially for this type of game. Quests are actually fun and not all fetch they actually have lore. There is an absolute freedom: you can kill every npc and still proceed with the game. The gameplay is some of the best ever. This genre has been ruined in the past decade with games like the Final Fantasy series dropping the traditional turn-based combat for an active combat. Yeah, thats nice in some circumstances but it is extremely boring hacking and slashing repetitively just like every other game. The combat in D:OS2 is calculated, and detailed. Everything is listed and heavily focused on strategy and statuses. The game encourages using environments such as high ground and environmentals like barrels and puddles in order to gain favor in battle.   The best part of the game is the fact it's challenging. The default difficulty will probably be too hard for average gamers and those not familiar with the genre or the first game. There are two higher difficulties on top of that which are extremely challenging (I normally play on the highest difficulty in every other game) The next best thing would be that the developers aren't EA, Ubisoft, Activision, etc and force paywalls on an incomplete game and don't support the game after launch. This dev actually cares and I have personally downloaded atleast one patch per day and they have already stated that they are going to implement being able to use your own character in multiplayer which is something I look forward to. Can't wait to see what's next for this game."

UKLonar,209,1,0,"November 9, 2017",Recommended,83.5,"I'd absolutely recommend picking this game up. It's a masterpiece of the modern age, with a classic-styled twist.  Although difficult at times, you can usually figure out a method of beating fights. Despite what some people are saying, the game isn't too hard. There are so many builds/skills you can choose from and many many sidequests to get gear and level up; better preparing you for the difficult fights. You also don't need to go online and look for ""Cookie cutter"" builds. So don't let people put you off!  Although, get used to ""Savescumming"" whilst you learn encounters.  I'm not well versed with CRPG's so I was hesitant to pick this game up initially.  However, I'd now recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs.  I'll be running through my second-playthrough soon, as I know I've missed a fair bit!  Give it a chance, you won't regret it! "

Ray G. Quit,281,1,0,"November 11, 2017",Recommended,210.4,"Pretty good RPG with a classic feeling to it. A lot of content and a lot of replayability. The fact that you can play it with a friend and give him control over characters (4 party members, so we played 2:2) is just awesome and led to many laughs. I would recommend it and I'll just highlight 3 aspects of the game that were memorable about it in the good, the bad and the ugly (okay, the neutral).   The good: I hate any tactician turn-based game. Often they're overcomplicated. But this one? This one was ... definitely complex but somehow I came around to like it. Everything made sense and learning how things works by setting EVERYTHING ON FIRE was a fun experience. Gameplay is just fun, making a builds and testing them out was great, there's a lot of possibilities to go around. Lots of things to find, lots of ways to resolve an issue, lots of surprises. If gameplay is what you're after then you won't be disappointed.  The bad: BUGS. Oh my god the bugs. Not many - true, but one extended turns in a certain boss fight to make it last forever for enemy to finish his turn. Another one made me lose about 15 hours of progress, because I couldn't access ""home-base"" waypoint and had to load older save. And yet another - by a chance we found out a bug that can make you immortal duplicating an Idol that ressurects you for no cost at all so you could gear up your whole team with immortality idols and pass the game in easy mode. What the hell. Larian fix your game, bugs in key moments are not acceptable, especially after the game came out of early access.  The neutral: Story and lore. Honestly only story for your companions was any good and made you care. Overall the game is about ego trip to become divine and often we were in a pretty good spot to not care about anyone else than our own quest to power. Factions and key characters even when they started as good, sooner or later they ended up not so rightous to a point I didn't mind killing most of them. Never felt there was any greater incentive to be ""the good guy"" or choosing ""the lesser evil"" in this game. The whole world felt not worth fighting for. Maybe that is the point? It's not bad, it definitely had some depth to it, but still felt ""meh""."

Hierophant Druid,24,1,0,"December 6, 2017",Recommended,147.4,"Long have I been looking for a big RPG game in the trend of Baldur's Gate/Planescape Torment and to a lesser extend NWN and NWN2. That wait is over.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 gave me that same feeling I got when I first played Baldur's Gate 2 so long ago. It has a giant sprawling world with so many things to do and so many mechanics to make it even more fun, I spend so much time plotting on how to rob merchants off their goods/money. The turn-based combat is very addicting, I am normally not a fan of turn based combat, but D:OS2 does it incredibly well, very much like X-Com.   For those of you who loved Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 and are a bit turned off by the turn based combat, please give this game a chance because it's the closest thing we have gotten to BG.  The story of this game is alright, there are plenty of mysteries and questions unanswered at the start and middle of the game to keep you engaged. But the main focus in this game is its story and game mechanics. The way the quests and maps compliment each other makes it very addicting to completionists. You want to complete every single quest in each area. This combined with amazing visuals and great sound, it is definitely worth all the money.  I finished the game in about 140+ hours on my first playthrough, and every hour was worth it, I cannot recall a single game (next to BG/BG2) that gave me this many hours of fun in a single playthrough.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 gets a solid 9 from me."

Potatus Tomatus Greenbeanius IV,175,1,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,224.2,"A great game. But it seems they ran out of resources at some point mid-development.  Nice story, nice graphics, a lot of quests, none of the quests is repetitive, all the voice actings, and all that. The game itself is fantastic and exceedingly immersive as I've spent around 200 hours to finish just the first playthrough.  However, it is apparent that they rushed on finishing the game from somewhere like 2/3 of the way. The most noticeable evidence, which a lot of people on the discussion forum complain about, is that somewhat rather many quests will not properly be completed. For instance, even if you've done everything and the quest log also says so, the quest remains uncompleted and say something like you abandoned the quest, when you move to the next area. The next problem, from my experience, is that I've noticed some slopinesses here and there throughout the game. For example, some dialogue options are just null, which means the game (or npcs) doesn't recognise the dialogue options and just quit the conversation. For another example, there is a quest in an earlier chapter involving an npc which implies there is more to be found in later chapters about the npc, but nothing ever mentions anything about the npc as if she never even existed, even if the npc has been on the same boat (literally) to the very end of the game. They are not like game breaking bugs, but still, annoying and feel like that their care for polishing the game has been started decreasing at some point.  Overall, I'm not saying like the game is bad or anything like that, it's just that I've noticed these small things (maybe big?) throughout the game and they were annoying. Consider it as a small complain. But still, it's a great game and worth every penny, and that's why I'm giving it a yes to 'Do you recommend this game?'. It's been a great experience and well spent over-200 hours. I highly recommend the game. If they do some patch-works, I think it would be safe to call it a masterpiece. :D"

You can spent hours just listening to characters, speaking with NPCs and enjoy the environment. Not that you have to, but you can. where you have to follow dialogs for quests they are to the point but entertaining and really drag one into the game.  PLayed the storyline in Coop with a friend (2-2) and also the coop gameplay is double+. turn based combat along with the deep strategy and knowledge of your skills make fights extremly challengeing and rewarding at once.

Cool Barry,149,1,0,August 9,Recommended,205.2,"My all time favourite RPG. Major plus is that it is getting a very large update (""Definitive Edition"") that's free for current owners, which adds graphical and interface updates and over 30 hours of content.  Pros: Up to 4-player fun Different ways to progress and clear encounters Different builds allow you to make unique characters Playable pre-made characters have interesting storylines Really makes you feel like Batman Interesting changes to how you approach the game depending on your chosen race The most Dungeons and Dragons like game I've seen so far Massive editor to make your own campaigns and have your friends play in it  Cons: The hardest difficulty mode is way too easy and I beat it without looking up guides online or preparing for it in some way. Can have framedrops in some areas if there is a lot of stuff on the ground (fire notably). Supposedly being improved in the definitive edition. You can have a hard time if you make mistakes while building your character, but you can fix this for free not too far into the game."

Silverborn,256,1,0,"December 2, 2017",Recommended,396.4,"This game has to be one of my all time favorites. Tactical freedom is close to rediculous. From the team you pick, the weapons you choose, the small moments the world interacts with you, or you realize that an entire area's storyline has changed (ever so slightly, but with some weight) because you chose to be a baddy for 3 minutes, the second time. This game is the perfect example of how games should be.  Divinity Original Sin 2 has depth, amazingly fun gameplay. Can be massively challenging and punishes those who run into danger without thinking. I'm currently on my honor run close to the ending of Act 2. This is the hardest difficulty with permadeath. Meaning... when your party dies, you lose your savegame. And no... this is not Xcom where you can Alt-F4 when♥♥♥♥♥♥hits the fan. The second a character dies, the game saves for you. Good luck getting yourself out of that pickle. With good preperation comes great rewards. Fights can be easy at times, but if I think for one second that I'm overpowered..? The game punishes me hard.  And that is what I love. It's like advanced chess, but you don't play ""the same pieces"", your characters evolve, become stronger. No pure warrior, naaah... give him some heals and necromancy spells to leech the blood out of your enemies. Making him the most dangerous guy on the field at all times. Feel like your character isn't strong enough? Give your archer some support spells to boost each others moves. Now your dangerous guy has the potential to kill four characters in two turns. And who needs a shield when you have a healthpool of 3000 health, hit with 500 dmg per swing and heal 70% of the damage done? One good area attack and you are healthy as an ox. And I know that when my warrior gets nuked with stuns etc? My archer is there with the right support spells to get him out again. And at no time am I really overpowered. Two times I almost lost my savegame because I misjudged a few skills from enemies. The constant struggle to play with the best optimisation and adapt to the game's AI. It's simply amazing.   Don't expect too much from the main story. It has depth, interesting aspects but you buy this game 100% for the gameplay. Do know... you CAN kinda abuse the game at later levels. There are skills that can be abused so you absolutely trash everything with the proper respec. Keep in mind that figuring out how the game works, what spells do etcetera, THAT is where the most fun is.   Some other Pro tips: - Stealing is great fun, saves tons of money and keeps your party geared up (probably the best tip, do not-not steal).  - Undead are awesome, but start with a regular team, different mechanics can mess your party up if unprepared.  - Stick to either full physical damage OR full magical damage. Trust me on this one, you will thank me later.  - Summoners are overrated. They kinda make fights last 3x longer than needed. Only pick them if you absolutely love the mechanics.  - Figure out how to use stealth in combination with teleportation. You can ""cheat"" some fights that will otherwise trash your party.  - You can respec shortly after the end of Act 1, which is - on average - 10 hours of gameplay - Crafting... almost EVERYTHING can be crafted. You only get to see 10% of the recipes that actually excist. Just google a crafting wiki. Thank me later. Don't wait until you find the books. If you want to make something, you probably can.  - Make sure your characters can survive alone as well. If they are too dependent on each other you will have a hard time nearing the endgame.  - Last but not least... Aim to finish about 80% of all the (side)quests. You will need the experience until the middle of Act 2, after that the game becomes a little more flexible when it comes to XP.   Downsides of the game? It can be buggy, but rarely game breaking. AI can be brutal, feel unfair... but there is a pattern to exploit at all times. Quests can still be bugged out because you did something so complex that the game doesn't really know what you actually did."
Loki Asgrimrsson,266,1,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,130.9,Exceptional! The sequel absolutely blows it out of the water! Rare is it that a developer learns from its journey and completely exceeds all expectations with a sequel... I'm so accustomed to sequels being lack luster or over hyped for what they become..

ShimmerVoid,345,1,0,"October 18, 2017",Recommended,100.3,"DO2 is quite the masterpiece. There's just so much content and most of the choices you make have very real consequences, much like the Witcher series. Characters are interesting, lines are well written, gameplay is really good (comparable to good old Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and similar titles but instead of being semi real time it's actually turn based in DO2), character customization is out of this world (no strict classes restriction; anyone can pick up any skill as long as you have the prerequisite skill levels) and interesting races (undead in particular) make DO2 a memorable experience and easily one of the best games for 2017.  One minor gripe though, in my first playthrough I couldn't quite get the ending to trigger properly as it was bugged. I did make some very odd choices along the way and was playing just a 2 man party so maybe that might have broke a few things but still ... it really bummed me out. At any rate, aside from that it's a fantastic game and one that I can recommend to anyone who wants a really deep, replayable and enjoyable RPG."

Fun co-op tactics, but just as enjoyable to do a solo playthrough and spend time questing and learning the lore of the characters. How you play this game is up to you. 9/10. Only point lost is for incompatibility of some player mods. I spent 25 hours creating a campaign to GM for my friends, but found out they are unable to run it (and mods are irreversable on GM mode). Otherwise, perfect."

The story is cool and I defintely like having a good story line in the games that I play.

It has been years since I've experienced such an engrossing game that has snagged my attention so tightly, that I'm already contemplating my next playthough before I've even finished (thinking 2-Hander, Death Knight style). That too: you can effectively combine the numerous capabilities possible in the game to create archetypical styles, or something completely unique!

XPGLD,240,1,0,October 16,Recommended,125.6,"Larian yet again hits it out of the park. Another game with so much attention to detail it's almost criminal. Though Divinity is a fantastic game, it is not without its faults either. If you haven't play the original, which does not bar entry to enjoy Divinity 2, you may find the tutorial area lacking in, well tutorials. While some may find this to be a feature, I found that it made the first few hours of gameplay a slog of trial and error before I figured out how to be even slightly effective in combat.  All around however, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a fantastic game that you can enjoy solo, or with up to 3 friends. If turn based tactical combat is your cup of tea, there aren't many games out there that do it better than Divinity."

Beardless Man,38,1,0,October 16,Recommended,373.2,"One of my most highly recommended RPG games to date. This game has really been a prime example of a true Roleplaying game ought to be. From gameplay, to storytelling, character customization, and character builds that is entirely up to you.  I'll break down the game by its Pros and Cons, and add some of my feedback or advise at the end to help change the game.   PRO'S: - Character Creation is very open and fluid, but not restrictive. Playing as Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Lizards as well as undead counterparts;  These races all have their unique traits and uniquely recognized in the game. NPCs react differently on the race you play.  The customization options certainly could always use more; but you can always find a good look for you.  - Combat is all about problem solving. All dependant on the builds you create to help expertly pass speicifc fights. If you don't specialize in Persuasion to avoid some fights all together.  Whether your team is all ranged, melee, magic, or mixture of all three. Your job is to figure the best tactful moves to assure victory. Wether you have multiple healing aiblities spread across the team, or one dedicated healer.   - World environment is gorgeous. Even wtih a top-down view. You can always look through the area and see such attention to detail . Not a single place in this game feels like a drag-drop copy. And it all flows perfectly.   - Voice acting is top notch, whether you play an Origin Character or Custom Character. The Origin followers have brilliant commentary that give their personality great depths. NPCs all are uniquely voiced with very few reprisal roles that still achieve a personality.  Even better how all the NPCs have hundreds of dialog branches based on your race, gender, and background tags that you select or have as your origin character.  - The game rewards thinking out the box. Whether you skip a puzzle through mobility moves, or attack specific NPCs. IF you get a grasp of specific play, the game will recognize clever  behavior and will speak of it in later gameplay.  (**Minor Spoiler**: Dallis the Hammer, a primary antaognist can be attacked as soon as the beginning of the game. If you manage to defeat her, she escapes and leaves a very powerful hammer, and comment on it when you engage her once more.) ----------------------- Cons:   - Character Creation can be a bit limiting for specific races that lack additional features such as beards. If an update patch or DLC added more options. It would make the uniqueness of your character stand out.  - Some weapons like wands become weaker in the late game and could use a numerical change to come up to par. Often one will drop wands for a staff due to the lack of numerical value.  - Some design choices for mandatory abilities such as Bless require a memory slot despite the high volume of times in the game its required to be used. Some changes for it to always be memorized would be beneficial to match.   ----------------------- Advise / Feedback: I would change the ability: Bless to not require Source. The ability has great demand in the storyline; but mechanic wise; its primarily the weakest option only because Source Abilities are rarely used until middle/late game. Bless becomes increasingly worthless the further one progresses.   It also acts as one of the only few counters against the Cursed Status, which is a huge problem in the later game when one faces the Voidwoken.   The Pet Pal: Talent should be changed for those who have the Sir Lora DLC To whomever he follows; he should grant the Pet Pal talent to. If one lacks the talent; this little squirrel sadly becomes more of an annoyance than a fun little mobile dialog through the story.   More Origin choices for custom characters - Currently the only origin ability that custom character gets is a protective dome. If we should choose from a selection of Origin abilities, it would give us further importance on decisions. Though I could see why it'd encourage more people to play differently.   "

HammerTime,86,1,0,October 17,Recommended,52.7,this game is absolutely incredible
Squidcake,449,1,0,"November 25, 2017",Recommended,83.0,"it's a great game, but near the end things start to fall apart abit. The last area(s) of the game are unnecessarily large (Arx) and just kill the game's performance. Combat also mostly becomes fairly tedious with enemies just spamming crowd control, sometimes resulting in watching your turns skip 5 times in a row, just to have the enemy repeat the process. Other battles involve finnicky mechanics like infinite respawn unless killed in a certain way, that don't behave the way they should.  Overal, still a great game, but I really wish the end of the game was planned out better."
Slimey,110,1,0,October 15,Recommended,198.7,"I'm going to keep this pretty much short and to the point. On the whole I really enjoyed this game, but there were a few niggles that stick out. Nothing show stopping, but there nonetheless. I liked the story and I loved the characterisation. I feel it developed well as the gaem went on, though I feel the 3rd act was a little off kilter from the rest and teh 4th was a little rushed as the end came near. I'd argue this could have held upa 5th act fairly easily and left the story pretty well rounded out. As per the orignal game the graphics are excellent and with the characterisation I actually felt this the better of the 2 games.  But a few things stood out as cons and depending on your game style/preference this may affect how you approach the game. - Some quests are difficult to work out. The fact some can pop into your journal with almost no exposition beforehand and/or they have obscure solutions that can be almost a fluke to complete breaks the story for me. It's mainly side quests, but when you are trying to max experience to level up your characters its annoying to chase half way across the map because you missed something. And the fact some characters can remain 'red flagged' even after completing a quest is plain annoying. - Necro fire is overdone. With all the possibilities of surface/cloud mechanics, this gets tired quickly. Especially in act 2. - It's not clear from some spell descriptions exactly what they do. It's pretty annoying to fire off a spell and find it didn't work because you missed a line of text or the like. (Along these lines, it also annoys me that after spending effort on writing up descriptions for things they are often unreadable because the descriptive box doesn't draw correctly) - Determining the correct responses/best persuassion chances is sometimes almost random, and the fact in some conversations your ratings almost do not matter. It would be more realistic to be able to explore a characters wants and needs and then come up wiht the right answer to a question, than to plain guess in many instances. This breaks the narrative for me and the fact the wrong conversation option in some places can all but break a quest is jarring. - Depending on how you levelled up, selected spells etc. the end can be almost an anticlimax. Wrong choice can get you wiped out in a couple fo rounds, 'right' choice can win it for you very quickly. Tactics are almost taken out of the last battle entirely.  But it still a great game. I still haven't completed PoE, let alone picked up the sequel. DOS2 at least has an easy to follow plot and characterisation to carry you along. If you can put up wiht its foibles, its one of the best in the genre."

[TINC] Lico,284,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,84.1,"Divinity 2 brings all the good elements of its predecessor, with incredibly smooth level/power scaling and low potential for exploits. Brave the world in any way you want, be it killing everyone and everything you see moving, sneaking and pickpocketing around or tricking NPCS with your persuasion skills. Combat is very dynamic, with a single spell able to completely transform the battlefield. For example, if I use Rain and then cast a fireball on a water puddle between my party and my enemies, the steam cloud will obscure their vision, forcing hand-to-hand combat. The story is well developed and Origin characters integrate seamlessly with the world and its characters. D:OS2 has my Seal of Approval!"

FireFox Bancroft,360,1,0,January 24,Recommended,15.8,"This game does not hold your hand. Remiscent of older AD&D CRPG's. You control a small 4-player party Baldur's Gate-style around a big world map. Each character in your party has unique skills and abilities. Learn them, train them, master them. You can only have four (4) characters in your party so choose wisely.  Expect brutally and sometimes unfair dice-roll turn-based combat. As for questing, again, don't expect any hand-holding, you either figure things out on your own or you look up a walkthrough. Your quest journal is light on hints as well. They DO give hints but they only give you a nudge in the right direction. NPC conversations contain more detailed hints so you have to really pay attention to what they're saying. Oh and important NPC's CAN die and mess up your progress and you will either have to find another way to complete a quest or reload a previous save. Or just live with the death of that NPC and move on. And speaking of saving, this is a game where you either save-scum or you live with the consequences of your choices.  I can recommend this to hardcore CRPG players who are looking for fun and a challenge. I can't recommend it for RPG-lite players who are used to thinbgs like Oblivion or Skyrim.  My overall assesment of this game is: ""Brutally challenging and interesting without being difficult for difficluty's sake like Dark Souls"""

I havent played much however simply exploring the towns and talking to people before getting destroyed in combat is simply wonderful. Gonna get this game for my friends so we can play together.

Only downside is some quests can be confusing and hard to figure out, but youtube can help if you get stuck. The combat is challenging, but there are lots of skill and spell combinations to try out to ""help"" your enemy go to ""sleep"". As for the graphics they look gorgeous, nothing more to say about that :). If you're like RPG games with a big replay factor, get this one (and else get em when it's for sale, just get it :))."
LouskRad,"3,694",1,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,165.8,"Simply amazing.   In terms of strorytelling, this rpg provides an immersive experience with a story you won't guess from the first gameplay hour. It's epic and it's character dependent (to a point). The optional pre-made characters enrich this story, even if the player does not play one (they can also be rectuited as party members).  In terms of rpg gameplay dynamics, the potential this game offers for character skill variation can result in absurdly overpowering characters, yet the level progression system somehow compansates; resulting in a feeling of powermonger.  On top of these, all dialogues are voice acted, graphics are beautifully stylized (ne can especially find the richly colorful style goes quite interesting with story) and the game camera works wonders.  As a result, I was quite happy that I backed this game and it was honestly better than I expected."

The Fleshining,114,1,0,July 3,Recommended,69.7,"Have you ever asked yourself what would happen if they could make D&D into an actual videogame? Well look no further! I've been on the fence about buying this game for a while, I finally picked up this game on sale and I'm so far 17 hours into playing this game. All I can say is this may be the greatest RPG I have ever played. Does it have the greatest graphics? No. It is mouse click controls as opposed to WASD. This game more than makes up for all of that with the richness of it's story and lore. In additition the character customization as well as the sheer amount of decisions you can make to complete a quest are vast and astounding. For a game that is not that graphics intense it is still 26 GB and you can see where all that memory goes. You can talk to every single NPC and animal (if you have that skill) in this world and they all have a voice you can actually listen to. You can kill any NPC you want but keep in mind that everything has a consequence in this game. Combat is interesting and again, depending on what skills you have, can be approached in multiple ways depending on the challenge. You can be a ranger with wings, fly up to the high ground and have a tactical advantage. Have a battlemage, shock the most powerful foe, stun lock him while the rest of your party kills all the others. Be a rogue and give every enemy the suprise buttsecks.... everything is a possibility in this game. If you have looked at the game description and been intrigued but maybe not convinced to buy this game, don't even think about it just buy it. You will get your money's worth. This is a game I see myself replaying multiple times in the future."

Atak,28,1,0,September 9,Recommended,103.4,"For someone like me who got mesmerized by the first game, this game can only get better; not the other way around.  Combat mechanics are absolutely brilliant and it adds to your roleplaying too. Fantasizing about your wizard cast a rain spell and your ranger pulling out a electric arrow from his backpack and stunning the enemy is delightful. With definitive edition, online pvp matches got an overhaul and it definitely got better. Only problem is there is not much people playing online so when you search for matches you find 2 rooms which are both full for example.  Having the choice of playing with diffrent characters is a wonderful edition to the first game. Commanding your team and living the story through each  4 individuals perspective in one go might be a bad thing for some of us but the choice is yours. You can choose to go through 2 - 3 diffrent playthroughs and each one would be a bit diffrent than each other.  Or maybe you want to play co-op online,local or on LAN with your friends and go to your seperate ways in the same game! Larian did an amazing job by keeping the loading screens to minimum-none; meaning you can teleport around the map, find your friend in a faraway pub in a seemless transition which why this game doesn't let you go and captivates you.  My displeasure with this game is its art style for character models and portraits. Of course everybody have their own tastes but for a beautiful game like this, characters seem a bit off putting for me. Also the first part of the game can get repetetive after multiple playthroughs which can stop you from starting over again after a few times. Maybe diffrent beginnings for each character or a more sandboxy start would be better in my opinion.  Songs and voices are great. Humour is there for the ones looking for, so the game is not edgy or too dramatic. Larian really busts their asses to give you quality content and making the definitive edition free for the owners of the original game only deserves appreciation. Definitely worth playing. Best RPG on the market for now."

Nikanuur,218,1,0,July 18,Recommended,386.3,"Overall: 11/10 for a RPG fan, probably two points down for other people due to it's sheer RPG monstrosity.  Gameplay: 10/10 Awsome in terms of RPG. At the beginning the game starts pretty-ok-but-not-really-great, but don't worry dears! It get's *really really* more interesting in fun-wise, quest-wise, and lore-wise aspect the farther you are from the beginning and it doesn't seem to stop omghosh! Game offers zillions of approches with few standing out at the apparent ones. Game doesn't force you to attend to every choice or thing, you can really go your own build or be a jack-of-all trade. Ofc you can screw up hard, but than again, why you invested points willy-nilly in the first place? Good interface. Good outlook. Little to no glitches or bugs I found after 50 hours of real ingame (don't watch my 300 hours I sometimes forget the game in the background.)  Difficulty: ?/10 I play RPG my whole life. On hard settings I have really hard and frustrating combat sometimes. Paradoxically not with bosses but with semi-bosses and larger battles. Like reloading 5-6 times before I come to a solution, some battles just cannot be won by sheer force and positioning. But hey, they said it would be hard, right :D ? I believe on normal this is more normal, right? :D  Graphics: 8/10 As the isometric RPGs goe, this world and it's architecture is just wonderful. BUT there is one little bad thing that is big in impact though. Small items are often nigh impossible to see with your own eyes. Like keys, coins, gems, plants... :( it really forces you to hit alt to see all items in vincinity and spoiling the fun of being observant. The very first Divinity was impossibly great with it's keys hidden under the door mat, hidden switches behind barrels you had to move etc. Those were the days... but you could have seen those items, here, you really can't unless you have a 10x zoom in your cybernetic eyes, Larian, wtf, we are not all Krytons you know :(  Sound: 8/10 Everything is fine. Music is fine, sometimes even cool, though for me, there are no realy memorable songs or compositions. Voicing is really nice and suits the characters well on the other hand. Sound is good as sounds can go.   Fun:: 10/10 - Absolutely one in a million chance to play this as coop multiplayer. WTF MAN, shut up and take my money and my friend's credit card... - Teleportation spell. Oh my goodness. You'll know all the uses soon enough. - Healing undeads with poison? ok lol, wait it get's even stranger... - Chicken spell + Haste + Rupture tendons on enemies. HAHAHAHA - Hero remarks, having a Talk to animals skill makes you able to apprehend animals with their silly little quests, being often reminded of the points of morality more then from a fellow human :D, funny locations, easter eggs, Fane's view of the world, and his strange experiences being a lesser being :D.. - So much to explore, and being rewarded for being dilligent or observant of the lore and people's relations (but not much of the surrounding, as you now know). Or not, just go your own hacky-slashy way, you will have fun too. - Probably some replayability with the different characters, the game is huge as are the numbers of approaches you can take, but still, you might not want to play this beast after 200+ hours in it again."

That being said, I've probably played through this game like 6 times so far and not only is it still so fun, I'm pretty certain there are still things I have yet to see! The game is amazing as is, but the mods really let you take it to the next level.  Already, there are mods for crafting, combat balancing, new spells/items, and a host of other really cool/enriching elements that can be added.  I love to browse the workshop to see how I can spice up my next play through.  I'm more of a single-player person and so I haven't tried playing this game online, but I imagine if you enjoyed multiplayer then there will be 100s of more hours of quality gaming to be found with D:OS 2.

yvesp,67,1,0,"December 26, 2017",Recommended,375.6,"Larian turned gold to lead, but this game is probably worth it, provided that you know what you do.  First off, choose wisely your play level. I chose tactician as a veteran of RPG. I was well served. Indeed, tactician it is! But it doesn't say that you should also scratch every single little advantage that you can (steal as much as possible, stack on potions etc.) in order to be well prepared for the last fight. It also doesn't say that you shouldn't expect your characters to be heroic! Indeed, in many situations at that level you will have to resort to cheesy tactics such as some characters fleeing the combat to recover skill timers, heal, then come back while the combat has been frozen because you left one character or invocation hold it... Or by reloading consistently because you were not prepared for a nasty surprise in a combat and had nothing left to deal with it; so you reload, come back with smart prepositionning and the combat will go smoothly. I remember a fight against some outrageous horror -helped by numerous cronies, all of them more powerful than my characters despite being one level above-, which I easily lost head to head, then won after reloading, placing my characters far enough, engaging with invocations and keeping my characters far enough -actually out of combat- that I could always cast a new invocation when one died. I finally won that fight without a scratch. Smart ? sure. Pleasurable ? Hardly.  So unless you like going very slowly, always moving like there is a fight at the next step (or reloading often), managing inventories to be sure each character has the absolute best equipment, has the necessary consumables,  and so on (i.e. total micromanagement), skip the tactician level. At normal level, the game is going to be challenging enough for most players. Especially the last combat, which I never finished -I have done quite well in the first part, but am hopelessly outnumbered in the second part. I probably know what is wrong, but I won't be going back batching the potions that I am missing, respecing my characters to more useful stats, traits and spells, changing runes for more useful ones etc. you get the picture for tactician level.- So, I won't know the end of the story line I chose, and I won't change my storyline just so the last combat is easier. That's a bit sad.  And NO: YOU CANNO'T CHANGE THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL DOWN! That's a real shame!  Also, there is no excuse for larian in turning an excellent character development/combat system into the mediocre thing that it has become. In that respect, Original Sin 1 was way better. The current system has clearly been designed in order to foil the player and outrageously favor the opponents. You cannot inflict secondary effects (blinding, stunned etc.) as long as the target has magical or physical armor (a new protection that comes above your hit points.) This means that the first rounds of combat are always going to be damage dealing: you won't have any crowd control coming until you've done some attrition first. Worse: the system favors teams which choose a damage type and stick to it. I made the mistake of wanting a balanced party: the result is that I am too weak for the last fight. Actually in some fights, I had characters standing aside, watching the combat go because they did not deal the right kind of damage...  After all this has been said, I still recommend this game because the story looks good, the world is well developped and generally speakig as RPG go, it stands on the top if you don't fall into the trap where I fell.  EDIT: I finally found the courage to do what I said I wouldn't do, and of course finish the game. As expected, I had to respec my characters, and decided to go for lone wolf. The advantage in lone wolf lies not in the power of the characters (they indeed are stronger, but you have overall less firepower), but in the fact that you don't have to bother about the survival or such and such character, as well as reducing the drain on your consumables (you use two instead of four for a similar effect.) The fight was easy [SPOILERS (light) AHEAD] mostly for use of the special tea sold by Mrs Kremm, combined with at least +50% full elemental protection potions and five star dinner -i.e. all elemental damage did heal me, which both let me remove most healing spells as well as use my own offensive spells for healing-, the pawn and duck duck goose (for good movement, not mentioning spells.) Other talents which I thought would help did not (guerilla) [END SPOILERS] ; I changed my main character from pure mage to hybrid melee (fighter) / mage, helped by an archer/assassin ; as explained above, this was a choice to favor physical damage over magical damage, choice made necessary by the difficulty of that fight. I of course had to spend considerable time to prepare the characters and the consumables, buy or craft the required potions and books as well as redistribute equipment. The trouble is that in that fight I did not recognize the character(s) I played consistently from the beginning (no respec before the end), which is annying (to say the least) for a RPG! The other trouble is of course that I could not have to feeling that the hero was well above the other contenders to deserve my victory. Indeed, the stats of all other human opponents were consistently above those of the hero. Understand who can!"
Nekomatagirl,108,1,0,September 4,Recommended,117.0,"--No spoilers--  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a game that at first kind of looks meh. The graphics might not appeal to some and others might find the spells and other things clunky at first. But the game is rather quite the opposite of those problems. It's a great game but a game you need to get invested into. I enjoy the combat greatly because there is so much to do and so much to interact with. I also really enjoy sidequests and this game has a ton of them. There is a lot to explore and discover.  At the time of writing this I have about 116 hours and still haven't completed the game. Do not think that it tastes that long to finish a campaign, but merely there is a lot to look and do. One of the problems of the game isn't even the game's fault. It is the players. Some people drop games or get to busy to continue.  I've restarted the main campaign about a dozen times (sometimes my fault) before finding someone that would go all the way. But it really is a blast when you are with a friend or friends.  Though I must say the crafting system is kind of lackluster when it comes to anything but potion making. I barely use it unless it's to make potions. Some places are annoying to deal with and that one battle with oil slugs or whatever they were called didn't do my computer any good. Loading screens are longish but you barely have to do any load screens at all because the entire map is just available to you. The dialogue and narrator are also one of my favorite parts of the game.   Overall? I recommend it highly! It's absolutely worth it."

So I pick mine and I end up getting into a romantic relationship at the very moment with this human thug named Butter. Now I must meet her again when I escape this prison... my love, I shall see you again soon."
Grim Onyxheart,293,1,0,May 9,Recommended,85.5,"Really like this one. Huge ammount of character customization and reactivity to choices you make it the game with an ending that morphs to your actions.  The only downside is the combat is so heavy on crowd control that it's all about being the first to lockdown the action economy of your enemies and keep them down to win. Got boring after a while.   Everything else was really great, looking foreward to more from Larian"

If you are on the fence about turn based rpgs then this game is the one that will make you change your mind.   Pros:  Looks good.  Plays well.   Many hours of content.  Many skills come with classes.  You can make any build you choose.  Rich Story.  Worth the money compared to other games by far. Cons:   The start is very slow and can be hard on the higher difficulties untill you get geared.  Limitied camera options. Felt like it could zoom out further at times.  I give Divinity Original Sin 2 a 9 out of 10.

Much like how people like to be nostalgic about old games like legend of zelda, doom, half life, Baldur's Gate 2, Goldeneye 64 etc. This game 20 years from now will be in that same boat of people saying ""Aww man. you remember original sin 2?

If you had the old version you get this for free, you get Sir Lora and all that good stuff, but what if you're a new player?  You are intrested in DOS2, and wondering should you buy it? Let me tell you, this game is the most content rich game you will probably ever see. I used approximately 100 hours on the starting zones alone, and could do it again for 300 more if I would want to.  The game is worth it at full price, even if you complete it once, and the multiplayer is so well implemented. The game feels like a living world with 4 players where you can choose your route or host role playing sessions like D&D in the stage creator.  The game has constant friendly fire, making joking pokes at your friends possible, or even backstabs. Only one can rise to Divinity, and if all of you want to become Divine, wel I can quarantee an adventure full of wonder and explosive action.  Oh and also I've killed a boss in one turn by drinking potions in this game, so there's room for some really creative strategies too.  Have fun."

If you are even a hair interested in RPG/Strategy games, you have to try D:OS2. Goes to show you that you don't need a $60 pricetag for a GOTY worthy adventure!

Van_Akenstein,65,1,0,May 20,Recommended,149.2,"I have sunk a lot of hours into the first Divinity: Original Sin on console and worried how my epierience with the game might change on the PC. But the controller support has been incredible according to my co-op partner and I personally prefer PC controls now.   This is one of those games that you can brew a tea while playing, which is something I can respect. But then forget that it is there because you forgot for one turn that undead heal off of poison so you are too busy white knuckling your mouse to drink it. I've been there, it's not the best of times.  But real talk, this is one of my top 5 games of all time. The dialogue ranges from tense and engaging to absolutely hysterical and whimsical. The two Divinity: Original Sin games take the concept of co-op rpg to a different level. It allows you to play the game exactly the way you want to. The build variety is incredible and nobody in the party is ever feeling like a deadweight. Sometimes the wizard has better gear or the assassin has found better spells. Some builds scale better into the end of the game then others, but none of that even really matters if you are playing this game, because at the end of the day, this game is just endless ammounts of fun and excitement. The feeling of making a clutch play in this game and thinking with portals in the middle of combat to use your spells in a way you never had before is a glorious feeling. And then there is also saving your co-op partner with a spell or two they haven't seen yet. There are just many good times to be had here. I love this game, and I hope you will as well."
Knightsundere,208,1,0,May 16,Recommended,42.8,"- Prenote - This is a review from the perspective of someone who does not usually enjoy this style of RPG; I usually play action-oriented RPG's that don't use a turn-based combat system (Dark Souls, Skyrim, Devil May Cry, God of War, Metal Gear Solid, etc.). So, this is not a review that should be read by anyone who is a larger fan of these older-style RPG games - waste of your time. If you are one of those people, buy the game, it's right up your alley.   As for those who are new to this genre but heard of this game through glowing reviews and maybe friends, here's what I have to say.   TLDR; The combat is, surprisingly, the most entertaining part, while the story's pacing and general creativity are top-notch for the genre, but comparatively predictable, cliche-ridden, and generic for those who care. Leveling and playstyle customization is awesome, but the world does a not-so-subtle job of locking you out of areas until you've hit the next level.    The Combat: 9/10  I'm a fan of action-packed games with tense, reactionary elements and high mechanical skillcaps, so moving over to Divinity 2's much more tactical and strategic system set itself up as an obstacle for my enjoyment of the game. Surprisingly, it turned out to be my favorite part of the game - combos, while sometimes stale depending on your party comp (running 3 out of your 4 with Battle Stomp gets a little dull against anything less than 3 enemies), prove to be an exciting and rewarding aspect that I had thought gimmicky at first. Mobility is, per the usual in almost all games, the best abilities to have off of cooldown, but nevertheless, almost all builds and classes are very viable in almost every situation (though I don't recommend taking 4 characters who all deal physical damage exclusively).   The Characters: 8/10   Characters and dialogue are all excellently written, though some stand out far more than others (The Red Prince is an absolute must-have, both for combat capabilities and sheer brilliance in writing). Voice acting is additionally top of the line, though, as is the case with most RPG's, you'll start to notice the same person raising the pitch of their voice to act as another character. The singular downfall is that aside from the suggested companion characters that are brought with the player at the beginning of the game, companion options are bleak, with other companions being generic mercenaries hired for coin. It felt odd to see the original, suggested companions popping up throughout the story, as though they could not be replaced with Act-unique new characters. I don't want Beast the Dwarf, I want someone new. But in all seriousness, take. The. Red. Prince.   The World: 7/10   I have little to praise, but little to shame either. The world is top-notch, but falls into an unfortunately generic fantasy RPG rut, with little thematic or aesthetic originality. To some degree, this can be excused as Larian was working off of their previous entry in the series - however, without a strong terrain/world thematic foundation, there wasn't much that surprised me. Without rules of theme set, there is little that doesn't seem out of place, and little that does seem like it belongs any more than the next setpiece.   The Story: 6/10   This suffered from the same issue as the World - though superb in it's own right, the story is unoriginal and fails to make any significant impact on the player besides helping to push them along an ascenion route that summarizes the player's ultimate goal as ""become stronger"". This is hard to avoid when the premise of an RPG of this style is to make the player an all-powerful wrecking machine, but it's also a destination that I wish RPG's in this genre would have the nads to diverge from. I know where the story wants to put me from the very beginning cutscene, and though I don't have any qualms with knowing the good guys win, I at least want it to be less obvious.   Overall, Divinity: Original Sin 2, in the perspective of a non-RPG player, is a strong first game to break into the genre, but worries me to whether I'll like others, seeing as how lauded this one is.   To someone who doesn't typically play these games, I say wait for a sale - you might not get past the slightly weak opening segment.   To someone who does typically play these games, you'll love this one. Gung ho.   "

Razor,235,1,0,"May 31, 2017",Recommended,594.3,"My words can not do this game justice, it's a masterpiece, and it's not even fully released yet!   Almost 50 hours, two playthroughs, one alone, one co-op, will be starting a 3rd one in a week.  it's everything from the first game and better, now you can play as different races, even 4 (6 when released) premade characters with their own origin stories  It's a competitive coop game, basically a mini MMORPG if you have 3 other friends to play with.  the combat has highly improved over the last game, now with bless/curse affecting the surfaces/clouds, the new crafting system and the two new talent trees.   if you want a proper review on this game, either watch all 40 update videos from larian.  Or you know, JUST BUY IT.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Updating my review from the Early Access  After spending hours and hours of playing the campaign, I still stand by my review from the early access, I want to tell more about this game cause I simply adore Larian now.  The game consists of 4 Acts resulting in 5 Endings (I thought there are 3 endings in total, but no, it's 5, I know right?!)  They vary a lot in the sense of your character-companion relationship development and combat, especially if you play co-op (The co-op is lovely but it can ruin friendships, talking from experience here :D)  The modding community has done an outstanding job, so many custom skills, gameplay enhancement, I've even tried a totally new campaign recently, which bring me to my next point.  Most of my playing hour (2/3) would be the time I've spent on the GM mode, it's a nerdgasm, especially if you spend some time doodling around with the Divinity 2 Engine (around 100 hours in my case) you can make your own game, literally your own RPG adventure.  In conclusion, if you want to play a stand alone single player, D:OS2 will offer you a branching storyline, memorable companion and villians, silly moments when you talk to chicken and cow, and very dark moments as well, if you wanna have a fun experience with friends, again, D:OS2 is even better in co-op, and it's an RPG lover's wet dream in GM Mode.  I've seen some negative reviews about this game so this is regarding those people, do me a favor, if you're not a fan of RPGs and want to beat a game in 10 hours, just go and do that in silence, you're opinion doesn't mean jack after 4 hours of gameplay.  Otherwise, just buy it, you'll get your money's worth."

Even if you don’t like point and click games I urge you to try this game, I’m sure you'll change your mind. The level of immersion and character development is just unbelievable. The 6 origin characters bring out the absolute best in this game. The way each character reacts to the environment and your decisions along the journey will get you hooked.   And the combat... My god if it isn’t the most fun and addicting thing about this game. The number of classes and skills will guarantee that multiple playthroughs will not be similar.  Now onto the graphics... I don’t know if can give this game enough praise for their visuals and sound... it will immerse you into this chaotic and brutal world, the shift in music when you journey around will give you goosebumps. Each town and camp feel as if its accompanied with new ambient music.  Even though the price might be high for some, trust me it’s worth every penny! 70+ hours into the game and I still haven’t progressed much into the story.

D:OS really surprised me. I fell in love with that game about forty-five minutes into it. Larian is a great dev. They know exactly what they are doing, and I'm guessing D:OS2 takes what the first did well and does it a lot better. . Wonderful to hear that the PC community is loving this game!  Combat is Amazing and fluent, no deadtime and you always have to plan out your moves in advance.Well thought elemental combat system and seeing how every element such as blood,water,oil,steam,smoke,poison or electricity all behave with one another.   Roleplaying is insane. The amount of way you can solve a quest or a simple situation is astounding and the customization of your build is great, however it lacks in physical customization.  Story is really good, engaging and the world reacts to things you do and feels like a living world. You do not need to have played the previous games to understand where it comes from nor where the story goes.  Overall i think this is a great game with a lot of content and replayability, especially with the Gamemaster mode.   To enjoy with friends or alone, this game is a gem."

Grandpa_Wild,170,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,125.8,"9.5/10 so far... In summary this is a very difficult, detailed game with a high skill cieling, plenty of room for experimentation and variation, and lots of replayability value. One does not have to play the first game to enjoy this one; I have not, for the record.   Good: Never been as obsessed with a game since Witcher 3; however, it has much more replayability value due to the incredibily detailed battle system, the multitude of sidequests, the different companions, and practically infinite builds. This game somehow reminds me of Deus Ex and Fallout/Skyrim in that you can accomplish certain tasks in many different ways, which is most evident in the tags system in dialogue. However, in this game, the character you choose/make, the build you create, and the companions that follow you feed into the choices you will make, the way you will fight, and the way you play the game moreso than any game I've played before. This game really puts the ""role-playing"" in RPG. Also props for taking away my handholds, and, for the most part, getting rid of the giant arrow pointing me where to go and just teling me what to do through dialogue, exploration and experimentation.  Bad: Some of the UI and the save system annoy me: I have accidentally walked somewhere instead of reviving a teammate countless times, and one has to get used to quicksaving a lot. These are minor complaints at worst."

But better late than never as the saying goes. In my case, probably the best ever RPG in recent memory. And I'd like to think I played the best. Starting from Betrayal at Krondor, Baldur's gate, Neverwinternights, Icewind Dale, Dragon Age-this game trumps it all. I'm still just 90 hrs into the game and this game blows me away. Great voice acting, music, storyline, game mechanics, graphics. Definitely a must buy and play and be sure to have many sleepless nights ahead! Hehehe."

emperortodric,14,1,0,August 6,Recommended,243.1,"A refreshingly beautiful and well-written game. The characters are rich and it's neat to see all the various ways different party members interact with things differently. Impressed by the pacing and development of the story -- it really feels like you're doing more than playing a game. Part novel-reading, in a way, in how the world reveals itself to you over time.   It is dark, though - not a happy time for Rivellon - so if you're a person who actively dislikes blood, violent choices, dark thoughts, etc, and prefers more shiny Fantasy, then this isn't likely for you."

"""\(o.o)/""",46,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,167.4,"Honestly, probably the best game I've ever played. Here's why:  -The graphics and spell animations are amazing and hairrising!  -Epic storyline.  -The fights are satisfying as hell, and you play by your own rules, and your techniques. Whether that being to just stand face to face to the enemy, or hide behind walls and place traps to checkmate.   -You can fail quests in this game, but it won't make you lose or have to redo everything.  -You choose your style of playing, you can be the kindhearted hero who helps everyone and doesn't harm a fly. Or you could kill every single person you can find, you can still proceed in the story, although they may have different outcomes.  -There's a way around everything, stuck somewhere? For example [SPOILER ALERT]  If you kill Migo, his daughter won't give you any keys, but you could always steal the keys or kill her, and other than that, there are atleast 1 more way inside.  -The way the elements work is logical and epic, throw a water baloon at someone, then cast a cold spell, poof, they're ice (unless they have resistances)  -You don't need to know a single thing about the first game, in fact, I never even knew about divinity: original sin before this came out, nor have I cared to play it, and I'm totally fine.   -Doing kind acts that won't seem to give you anything in return (such as giving free gold to a random npc), are most likely to give you something in return in the long run. Such as discounts for what they're selling.  -Choosing your skills and talents can make your story go in a different direction. I mean, there's a talent for speaking to animals...who don't wanna talk to their pets??? And sometimes they also have important information  :)  -I could go on but I'm lazy and I wanna play now...so..ye...xD  (This is the first review I've ever done, and I've owned steam for MANY years, that should say something about the game)"

Jestertitan,37,1,0,May 11,Recommended,396.6,"I have been a Steam member for, oh I'd say 15+ years, and have never cared enough to write a review.  I am so passionate about this game that I felt inspired enough to write my thoughts.  You can get the highlights from other reviews, but I just want to share my feelings because I'm very meticulous when I buy a new game and I read all these reviews.  I have over 350 hours into this game so far, and I'm still on my FIRST PLAYTHROUGH!  Now, this is due to my playstyle.  If you wanted to blast through the game I'd imagine I could in 50 hours or so, but I like to get all I can out of a game, and boy does this game have a lot.  Between the music, phenomenal gameplay, graphics (mine are low though because my computer sucks), and mostly the story.  What a great story.  Up there and maybe even better than witcher 3.  I put 700+ hours into skyrim and I can see myself playing through this game another few times to top that, and I haven't even gotten into the multiplayer yet.  If you like RPGs and turn-based games, or story-rich games, then this is for you.  There are so many variations you can play through between all the different builds, skills, spells, potions, crafting, etc.  This game is right now my favorite of all time, or at the very least top 5 all time of any game type, and I consider myself a moderately hardcore gamer with decades of experience gaming.  You will not regret this purchase.  People say there are bugs but I personally have not experienced any.  Most of the time people complaining about bugs is them just missing something, be it a hidden door, or stat effect that they don't know changes something.  I haven't experienced a single bug, maybe because I bought the game late after fixes.  Either way, buy this.  You won't regret it."

yasen400,161,1,0,June 27,Recommended,33.8,"6/27/2018  Right, so thus far I've played for ~17 hours and I gotta say, this game is great.  So why is it great?  I started this game expecting my years of experience with rpgs to make this game a breeze. Oh boy was I wrong. This game punishes you for not equiping both you and your teammates. DON'T FORGET TO EQUIP YOUR TEAMMATES.  for the record I was playing it on classic difficulty(normal).  All I did in these 17 hours can be summed up in 2-3 sentances. Later on I found out that I could have done the progress I did in those 17 hours in less than 6 hours. So here's what happened to those interested:  I got on a prison island and met up with a few companions, I got equipment and got myself arrested hoping to get into the fort joy castle. I did and from there I escaped through the front gate. Then I met up with the resistance and got a superweapon to destroy the enemy superweapon in order to get a ship to get out of the island.  In any other game this would take place in the span of 1-2 hours and would have no player control. You would be doing a sort-of ""tutorial"" and by the end of it you would be set free (kind of like in every elder scrolls game). However in this one the tutorial is you playing. You are trying to get off the island, the game is not going to help you, giving you waypoints and saying ""HEY DUMBASS GO TO THE GUY I'VE MARKED ON YOUR MAP AND TALK TO HIM AND THEN COME BACK"". The game is going to tell you to do something and you have to figure out how/when/with what to do it. Like for instance 1 quest generally is listed as a jouranl. and as you gain more information about how you can complete the task/quest that journal fills up with info that you've learnt through exploring/conversing/fighting. It doesn't show you a magic waypoint to your next objective, nor does guide you as to what you should do(or what you will encounter). After escaping the fort I found 150000 different (WAYYY easier) ways of escaping the fort that could've saved me like 5-7 hours of playing. This is one of those games where there are so many ways you can do something you will probably never see all the things you could've done in each given scenario. It kind of reminds me of a more refined ""Hitman: Blood Money"" in that way.  I haven't touched the coop, nor Gamemaster, nor Arena modes, however that is what I'm going to be diving in once I complete my playthrough and master the mechanics.  GameMaster I'm really interested in, seeing as I love the idea of actually playing a DnD game with actual game mechanics and a GM."

Gulthor,136,1,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,208.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is an isometric computer RPG in the tradition of old-school pen & paper RPGs (such as Dungeons & Dragons) brought to the digital age.  In DOS2, you'll take on the role of one of six characters (or create one of your own) to explore, interact with friends and foes through interesting dialogue options, and engage in tactical turn-based combat encounters.  Whether you build your own character or play through the story of one of the six Origin characters, you'll be able to fully customize your character by choosing skills, assigning attributes, and picking talents that all synergize to make interesting and unique builds that change your options for interacting with the environment, with NPCs, and in combat.  As you play, you'll recruit the aid of up to three other characters (chosen either from the remaining available Origin characters or hired from a mercenary captain), but be warned; while choosing to travel with fellow Origin characters will open up new and interesting storylines to explore, your goals will sometimes be at odds. Like your main character, you'll also be able to customize your companions, creating a party that can stand up to the challenges that await you.   Alternatively, play with up to three additional players, and explore Rivellon together in jolly cooperation.  Although DOS2 is not procedurally-generated, and encounters are placed and not random, the choices you make and actions you take have long-term consequences that can dramatically alter your play experience, but in a way that feels surprisingly natural - even intended!  DOS2 is complex, and what seems intimidating to start quickly becomes a deep and engaging experience that both challenges you mechanically and drives you on to experience more and more of the story it has to offer."

Almost 50 hours, two playthroughs, one alone, one co-op, will be starting a 3rd one in a week.  it's everything from the first game and better, now you can play as different races, even 4 (6 when released) premade characters with their own origin stories  It's a competitive coop game, basically a mini MMORPG if you have 3 other friends to play with.  the combat has highly improved over the last game, now with bless/curse affecting the surfaces/clouds, the new crafting system and the two new talent trees.   if you want a proper review on this game, either watch all 40 update videos from larian.

The game consists of 4 Acts resulting in 5 Endings (I thought there are 3 endings in total, but no, it's 5, I know right?!)  They vary a lot in the sense of your character-companion relationship development and combat, especially if you play co-op (The co-op is lovely but it can ruin friendships, talking from experience here :D)  The modding community has done an outstanding job, so many custom skills, gameplay enhancement, I've even tried a totally new campaign recently, which bring me to my next point.  Most of my playing hour (2/3) would be the time I've spent on the GM mode, it's a nerdgasm, especially if you spend some time doodling around with the Divinity 2 Engine (around 100 hours in my case) you can make your own game, literally your own RPG adventure.  In conclusion, if you want to play a stand alone single player, D:OS2 will offer you a branching storyline, memorable companion and villians, silly moments when you talk to chicken and cow, and very dark moments as well, if you wanna have a fun experience with friends, again, D:OS2 is even better in co-op, and it's an RPG lover's wet dream in GM Mode.  I've seen some negative reviews about this game so this is regarding those people, do me a favor, if you're not a fan of RPGs and want to beat a game in 10 hours, just go and do that in silence, you're opinion doesn't mean jack after 4 hours of gameplay.  Otherwise, just buy it, you'll get your money's worth."

I was shocked that there was not more buzz about that game and I was wondering what type of improvments could be made to make an already amazing game better. Well imo they did it. I suggest playing one of the orgin characters first. They each have their own back ground stories which just adds to the depth of the game.   If you like to custimize your characters (you can still custimize orgin characters class and appearance), if you like interactive worlds, if you like loot, if you like a rich story line, and if you like challenging game play this game is worth your time.   These are not 'fetch' quests, they do not feel repetitive, and there is not a marker to tell you where to go to next. So by exploring, speaking to npcs, reading your log book, and using logic quests are solved that way.  If I had a complaint it would be at times I felt like I couldn't 'help' an npc but there were many more times that I could.   11/10"
Dog Dreams,234,1,0,"October 20, 2017",Recommended,77.9,"This game is fantastic, let me get that out of the way first.  It has a gripping story and an extremely fun intro sequence that will keep you glued to your seat for hours. The story you start with is really just a set piece you have to follow, but there are tons of quests hidden within the world that you will find by accident most of the time. This game truly embodies what it is to be an RPG. It simply let's you do everything you want(within reason and without going to an A rating), you can be a hero or villain, coward or brave fool, sneaky assassin or loud barbarian, etc. etc. There really are too many scenarios to think of, but the game really makes you feel like you are in control of your future in the game.  There are some problems though, certain boss battles are kind of cheap since the bosses have to do certain things so they can one shot you or skip party members leaving you to watch your team die one by one. The second act is by far strongest, totally eclipsing the 3rd act and making you kind of have to drag yourself to the end. A few of the quest lines seem broken tbh, there were certain times a quest didn't end or just didn't proceed for no reason, even though these were small side quests I was still frustrated at not having been able to finish them. Also, there is no autosave feature, so sometimes you'll get into a fight you can't escape from and are too weak to win, so you'll die and reset to a save file from a half hour ago because you're not really used to saving, not gamebreaking, but extremely annoying, especially in a game like this. Other than that I don't really have any complaints.  I really recommend buying it, I guarantee you'll get your money's worth very easily and have a great time developing your Godwoken into true Gods!!!  Right now I'm eagerly waiting for whatever expansion is to come."

After playing D:OS2 I can safely say that was a shame. OS2 has easily become one of my favorite games. The gameplay mechanics are neat (even if RNG can be frustrating at times) and its visuals are spectacular. What really makes the game shine however is its story elements. OS2 has such a fleshed out story with options that branch out in so many ways that it really seems absurd at times. Rarely can I say that a game really made me question each interaction I had with the various characters strewn throughout. In my time playing there have been many moments where I participated in an event, met a NPC, or even stumbled upon a secret that made me think about what I wanted to do the next time around. What if I befriended so and so NPC next time? What happens if I don't help that one guy? What if steal the key and check that basement?

Literal Potato,227,1,0,May 30,Recommended,87.1,"TL;DR: Extremely well designed RPG overall, Great visual/graphics, Engaging and well written story, deep, fun, and challenging gameplay, would totally recommend this game if you are a fan of the genre  Aesthetics (Graphics, Visuals, Music): Absolutely top notch- the amount of detail in this game is astounding on a visual level. From each character looking fantastic, to the detail in spells and animation, to the level of beauty in the environment, overall this game looks great. The only drawback to this is that it's more demanding, resource-wise, than similar games. The music is also phenomenal and really follows the mood of the story without being too intrusive.  Gameplay: the combat system in this game is pretty similar to other CRPGs, but goes above and beyond. My personal favorite touch is the amount with which the environment can contribute to combat scenarios. There is a small learning curve which basically makes it the Dark Souls of- just kidding. There is a weird issue with balance where being overleveled by just 1 or 2 levels makes some fights trivial while being underleveled by 1 or 2 levels makes some fights annoyingly difficult, but overall, the game seems to do a good job of leveling the playing field... unless you're like me and added a mod that doubles the amount of enemies. One thing that is really underappreciated is how civil abilities affect gameplay. Characters have to balance environment and gear interactions, stealth skills, luck, and persuasion/bartering all in one pool of points. This can lead to balanced jack of all trades (master of none) characters, or min-max characters. This game also allows a lot of freedom in how to play by deciding lone wolf or travelling with a full party and by allowing you to constantly respec yourself and your companions.  Story: Extremely deep and interesting. I have found myself underwelmed by  lot of RPG stories as of late, thut this game was definitely an exception. Each of the comanions/prebuilt characers have their own stories which are fairly interesting but the main story and most of the side quests are captivating. There seems to be just enough instruction that you have an idea what to do, but this game will definitely not hold your hand and tell you exatly where to go. You can get lost or have absolutely no idea where to go, but it doesn't take a lot to get you back on track. Decently replayable - story length can be 30-70 hours depending on how into the story and side quests you get.  Notes: I haven't tried the multiplayer or GM mode yet"
Imperius,72,1,0,May 30,Recommended,107.3,"Didnt know i could like a turn based game so much. Never played FF so this was a great first game to try in the genre. Basically a D&D campaign in video game form. My preference in games is that there is an rpg element and this one satisfied that need. Fun to play with friends albeit it very slow. Replay value is low if you play on the hardest difficulty first and some of the skills for solo make the game very easy. Still very fun, by on sale."
Autumn,113,1,0,May 30,Recommended,74.0,This is probably one of the greatest RPG ever made. Turn based combat with a huge variety of builds allows for very imaginative playthroughs combat-wise. And the infinite amount of decisions that you can make throughout the game adds for replayability only to see even more of the story. 10/10.

The story is engaging almost entirely through story-telling (it's not highly interesting on its own). The gameplay is tons of fun if you like turn-based combat similar to DnD. You can make your character how you want OR play through as one of the prebuilt characters. If you make your own, fear not, you can recruit up to three prebuilts as other party members and experience their story that way. Each one is interesting and unique, and can play any class or build you want them to. I highly recommend the game!!"

yasen400,161,1,0,June 27,Recommended,33.8,"6/27/2018  Right, so thus far I've played for ~17 hours and I gotta say, this game is great.  So why is it great?  I started this game expecting my years of experience with rpgs to make this game a breeze. Oh boy was I wrong. This game punishes you for not equiping both you and your teammates. DON'T FORGET TO EQUIP YOUR TEAMMATES.  for the record I was playing it on classic difficulty(normal).  All I did in these 17 hours can be summed up in 2-3 sentances. Later on I found out that I could have done the progress I did in those 17 hours in less than 6 hours. So here's what happened to those interested:  I got on a prison island and met up with a few companions, I got equipment and got myself arrested hoping to get into the fort joy castle. I did and from there I escaped through the front gate. Then I met up with the resistance and got a superweapon to destroy the enemy superweapon in order to get a ship to get out of the island.  In any other game this would take place in the span of 1-2 hours and would have no player control. You would be doing a sort-of ""tutorial"" and by the end of it you would be set free (kind of like in every elder scrolls game). However in this one the tutorial is you playing. You are trying to get off the island, the game is not going to help you, giving you waypoints and saying ""HEY DUMBASS GO TO THE GUY I'VE MARKED ON YOUR MAP AND TALK TO HIM AND THEN COME BACK"". The game is going to tell you to do something and you have to figure out how/when/with what to do it. Like for instance 1 quest generally is listed as a jouranl. and as you gain more information about how you can complete the task/quest that journal fills up with info that you've learnt through exploring/conversing/fighting. It doesn't show you a magic waypoint to your next objective, nor does guide you as to what you should do(or what you will encounter). After escaping the fort I found 150000 different (WAYYY easier) ways of escaping the fort that could've saved me like 5-7 hours of playing. This is one of those games where there are so many ways you can do something you will probably never see all the things you could've done in each given scenario. It kind of reminds me of a more refined ""Hitman: Blood Money"" in that way.  I haven't touched the coop, nor Gamemaster, nor Arena modes, however that is what I'm going to be diving in once I complete my playthrough and master the mechanics.  GameMaster I'm really interested in, seeing as I love the idea of actually playing a DnD game with actual game mechanics and a GM."
Jaggers,199,1,0,June 27,Recommended,465.3,"One of the best games I've ever played, it's filled with hundreds of hours of enjoyment and the developers were generous enough to sell it at $45 on release.  Especially worth it on a sale."

Though the ending was a bit of a let down (too easy / quick), overall we had a great time and I recommend this highly. The combat is great and the learning curve was satisying for us.  Plenty of gameplay value for the price!"
kokane,18,1,0,July 3,Recommended,62.4,"As with its predecessor from 2014, Divinity: Original Sin II's setting remains the D&D-infused fantasy land of Rivellon, but the clock has been moved forward centuries from the original game so you don't need any familiarity with the backstory to quickly get up to speed with what's going on. You take on the role of a Sourceror, a name referring to those that draw arcane power from a mystic material called Source. This substance is controversial in Rivellon, because using it seems to inadvertently summon interdimensional monsters known as Voidwoken. Deploy Source powers and these bizarre creatures show up to kill everyone in sight. Because of this, you're viewed as a danger to society by the Magisters, a governing body of inquisitors and warriors who claim to serve the Divine Order and protect society by rounding up and ""curing"" Sourcerors.  This epic saga is a big undertaking. Expect to use up the better part of 60-70 hours to complete the main quest line and a good portion of the many side quests. The story isn't just extensive, though; it's detailed and gripping, largely due to how it avoids good-versus-evil fantasy archetypes common to RPGs.   The Good     Spectacular scope and depth that could easily keep you playing for over 100 hours      Detailed plot set in a world that seems completely lived in and authentic      Expansive tactical combat with seemingly unlimited options based on spells, skills, gear, and ever-changing battlefield terrain      Deep character creation and customization options due to extensive ability and skill options      Beautiful visuals along with an evocative musical score and impressive voiced dialogue   The Bad     Confusing journal makes it hard to keep track of individual quests and the plot     "

Mystic Pizza,80,1,0,"June 28, 2017",Recommended,48.1,"Going to keep this one short and sweet.  If you are fan of tactical old skool CRPG's or RPG games with immense depth in lore, combat and building a character exactly the way you want it then DOS2 is an absolute must buy. This really is the benchmark of just how deep RPG's can be.  Larian are easily up there with the greats like CD Projekt Red as a dev who are truly passionate about making great games for the fans and listening to what the community wants.   This is not just the RPG of the year, this could very easily be GOTY 2017, hands down.  If you are new to the genre, the learning curve can be a little steep. DOS2 will not hold your hand, but the journey is well worth your time and to get the full experience of every aspect the game has to offer, you have literally 100's of hours of epic RPG goodness ahead of you.

CptRagebeard,104,1,0,April 20,Recommended,112.1,"This game is, by far, the best RPG game I have ever played in the history of all my 20 years of gaming. I cannot wait to put thousands of hours into it. The only issue I have with it, however, is how limited the character creation system is, but I guess no game can be absolutely perfect. That said, here's why I love this game and will enjoy playing it for likely years to come.  The story:  I've only ever gotten so far as ACT II, but even still, the story in that time is so rich it'd put the CEO of the Amazon corporation to shame. The openess of the story makes for excellent roleplay elements. It'll keep you hooked and wanting more and more the further you delve into it.  Gameplay:  The only class restrictions are literally how you choose to build your character because of where you choose to put your attribute and ability points. That sky's the limit, and any kind of character imaginable can be built and played in this game. I would even go so far as to say this game is the closest game to a D&D simulator there can be without actually being D&D.  Combat:  Generally, I'm not a fan of turn-based combat outside of games like CIV games, but the system for this game really takes the cake. While the combat is turned based, the way it's set up to function is absolutely marvelous. The great minds at Larian Studios definitely didn't go wrong with it--at all.  Customization:  This game is open to steam workshop elements and modding. It also has a Dungeon Master aspect that allows you to create and run custom campaigns for you and four of your friends. However, I recommend playing the game as the vanilla version before adding mods to it, as some of them can be quite game breaking. Trust me, though, you absolutely won't regret it.  All-in-all, this game is pretty much perfect minus my only aforementioned problem with character customization. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this game and have absolutely nothing but good things to say about it! I give this game a 9.9/10."

JOHN BUTTMADDEN,261,1,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,201.0,"Do you like strategic roleplaying games like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Arcanum, Fallout 1 & 2, Dragon Age (the first one), or XCOM 2?  Well, you're going to love this.  This game combines the roleplaying depth of Dungeons & Dragons with a strategic feeling similar to XCom 2. Practically speaking, what this means is that outside of combat, you can do damn well near anything you can think of. In combat, you can do the same. If you want to break into that house, kill that lady, steal that gold, and escape into the night, you can. If you want to be the daring hero, and save shackled stowaways on a sinking ship, you can. This game gives you the freedom to truly explore the ""RP"" factor of Roleplaying games. Very few games these days can hold a candle to the amount of roleplaying this game encourages.   I think a number of groups of Dungeons and Dragons players will likely abandon tradtional and even virtual play, and just move their games over to Divinity: Original Sin 2. It's easy to learn, hard to master - not unlike D&D - and it's also aesthetically gorgeous in both music and graphics. Can't recommend this game enough. Buy it."

However, that went♥♥♥♥♥♥up when I made 1 or 2 tiny different choices and ended up getting completely new missions and encounters, it was as if I was playing an ENTIRELY new game!  Performance: I have just above the recommended hardware for this game and for the 100+ hours that I have played this game not once have I had to lower the graphics from the highest setting and I am always getting 60+ frames.  Controls: Although overwhelming at first, the controls become natural relatively quickly and can be utilised as you see fit, I have run into no inconveniences so far.

Bought for full price almost at lauch, somewhat doubtful and wondering if the price is not too much. But ended up thinking how did they manage to include SO MUCH for such little price tag. AMAZED as I weren't in very long time. Story fan? buy it! Battle enthusiast? Buy it! Explorer? Buy it! Will for sure crowd found their next project."

Lillta,43,1,0,June 22,Recommended,137.6,It's a really great game but unless you have inhuman willpower you'll likely get hooked and end up playing for hours on end. So I wouldn't recommend it if you're a busy person or looking for a casual game that you can just pick up and play a bit whenever you want it's however great for people looking for a lore rich rpg with nice graphics and fun combat.

angryhamster,17,1,0,August 27,Recommended,138.9,"I don't ever do reviews normally because I always think, why the heck would anyone be interested in what you've got to say?! lol! But this is how strongly I feel about this game!   A bit about me ('cos hey this is what you came to read right?! Nah, I just thought if you're like me you might enjoy this game too) I'm a 37 yr old female gamer and I love games ranging from GTA:V, Mass Effect, Battlefield, CoD, The Elder Scrolls Online, Skyrim, Dishonoured, God of War, The Witcher 3, Final Fantasy to Stardew Valley, Command and Conquer, Tropico etc, as well as all the retro Nintendo classics on NES, SNES, N64 and Gamecube etc.  So I've got a pretty eclectic mix of games I like, and I'm definitely not a gaming pro, more a casual gamer who just happens to get absolutely addicted to great games!  I stumbled on this one day browsing my queue and I'm beyond happy I did.  I actually think the storyline's ten times better than Skyrim (and boy do I loooooove Skyrim!).  The graphics are stunning and the music is so on point it's unreal. I've sank over 130 hrs into DOS:2 and if I didn't work full-time for a living I'd have probably sank in triple that amount, this is how engaging I've found it so far!   From having played games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights back in the day, DOS:2 immediately caught my eye as I fancied a nostalgia trip.... but damn it was SO much more than that! The narration is brilliantly engaging, witty and fantastically acted, and the love that Larian have put into building their characters backstories is blindingly obvious and unparalleled.  There's so much depth in there and it's so well padded out that I honestly can't fault it in the slightest.  Larian just became one of my favourite studios and I wish I'd known about DOS:2 when they were securing funding over on Kickstarter, because hell yeah I would have backed them!  The only thing I struggled with to begin with was the difficulty, in that modern games tend to spoon feed us tidbits and tips on what we should be doing in a game, they're full of map-markers and quest highlights on the map etc. specifically guiding us to the people and places we need to see, the tasks we need to do.  DOS:2 on the other hand demands that you think on your feet and outside the box! Sure it has a journal function with your quests loosely written in (actually in a journal format though), but it's absolutely down to you to work out how to accomplish that quest and there's zero hand holding.  But to be honest with you, it's actually something I've come to love about this game, for once it's a game that actually really requires to start using your brain, otherwise you're going to miss key elements of a fantastic story.  Enough waffling from me, just do yourself a favour and if you love RPGs of any kind, buy this! - I'm over 130 hrs in and I'm on Act 4 already looking forward to my next play through!"

Centrifikal,10,1,0,March 14,Recommended,46.7,For the sheer amount of content that this game has it is worth buying.  If you are on the fence about turn based rpgs then this game is the one that will make you change your mind.   Pros:  Looks good.  Plays well.   Many hours of content.  Many skills come with classes.  You can make any build you choose.  Rich Story.  Worth the money compared to other games by far. Cons:   The start is very slow and can be hard on the higher difficulties untill you get geared.  Limitied camera options. Felt like it could zoom out further at times.  I give Divinity Original Sin 2 a 9 out of 10.

noot,610,1,1,"December 29, 2017",Recommended,95.0,"tl;dr:  Divinity OS2 is one of the best RPG's and one of the best Co-Op games out right now, and quite possibly the best game I have played in years.  A friend of mine got me this game as a Christmas gift, and I have not been able to put it down since. I enjoyed Divinity OS1 before, but this game manages to outdo it in most aspects still.   The story is amazing. It truly makes you feel like every small decision you make matters, and changes both the course of the game, the way your characters personality forms and how they interact with party members and the world in general(and obviously how they react to you as well).   Most if not all dialogue is fully voiced by great voice actors(including the narrator), the sound track is atmospheric and immerses you straight into the fantasy world, and the graphics and world design are gorgeous.   When I played the OS1 for the first time the slow-paced combat kind of turned me off at first (I thought it was quite hard to survive, and kind of confusing), but once I got more into it I grew to like it, and with Divinity OS2 all my doubts about the turn based combat have vanished. It is a lot of fun to plan out your next moves with your friend. The game wants you to be creative and tactical in combat, so you better not try to run head first into every fight, or else you will probably end up dying many times.Rather you will often use the environment to your advantage( which reacts to pretty much anything you do ) applying status effects, luring enemies away to overwhelm them in numbers and combining elements with your party members to cause havoc.   The companions have rich stories, are fully voiced and quite interesting (I had a hard time picking a follower because they're all quite cool).   That's pretty much all there is to say: if you like (Old-School) RPG's and don't mind the slower paced more tactical combat system, this is probably the best game out there right now."

Starting from Betrayal at Krondor, Baldur's gate, Neverwinternights, Icewind Dale, Dragon Age-this game trumps it all. I'm still just 90 hrs into the game and this game blows me away.

The Fleshining,114,1,0,July 3,Recommended,69.7,"Have you ever asked yourself what would happen if they could make D&D into an actual videogame? Well look no further! I've been on the fence about buying this game for a while, I finally picked up this game on sale and I'm so far 17 hours into playing this game. All I can say is this may be the greatest RPG I have ever played. Does it have the greatest graphics? No. It is mouse click controls as opposed to WASD. This game more than makes up for all of that with the richness of it's story and lore. In additition the character customization as well as the sheer amount of decisions you can make to complete a quest are vast and astounding. For a game that is not that graphics intense it is still 26 GB and you can see where all that memory goes. You can talk to every single NPC and animal (if you have that skill) in this world and they all have a voice you can actually listen to. You can kill any NPC you want but keep in mind that everything has a consequence in this game. Combat is interesting and again, depending on what skills you have, can be approached in multiple ways depending on the challenge. You can be a ranger with wings, fly up to the high ground and have a tactical advantage. Have a battlemage, shock the most powerful foe, stun lock him while the rest of your party kills all the others. Be a rogue and give every enemy the suprise buttsecks.... everything is a possibility in this game. If you have looked at the game description and been intrigued but maybe not convinced to buy this game, don't even think about it just buy it. You will get your money's worth. This is a game I see myself replaying multiple times in the future."

I normally don't review because I'm not the type, but so many people are giving thumbs down because of day one server problems and it isn't in their language yet. If you're not incredibly impatient and like turn based RPGS, this is a must buy. If you like DND this is a incredibly huge must buy. The game's normal mode is a bit difficult though, so if you are new to turn based RPGS start on the easy ""explorer"" mode, and if you are experienced with Turn based games start on the ""normal"" mode. You will defintely be challenged in normal mode."
SeanTheSugoi,173,1,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,105.7,Probably the most fun I've had in a game in a very long time. Combat is indeed deep and sometimes you'll end up doing more damage to your team than your enemy would.

I started playing on tactician, and yeah, some fights really suck but it makes it all the better when you win them and get sick♥♥♥♥♥loot. The armor system is interesting. It took some getting used to but it's a pretty decent system when you think about it. The combat is phenomenal and has only improved since DOS1. Origin characters have great story behind them and everybody has their own motives and goals. Whether you work together or not is decided by how you play. All in all, This game is badass and I'm only 1/4 of the way through. I have noticed bugs here and there but I haven't experienced anything game breaking. When these are patched this game is an easy 11/10.  TL;DR: This game is a gem of an RPG. It doesn't hold your hand and that's one of the main reasons it's damn good.

It feels like a D&D game story-wise and the decisions you make can have big consequences. Combat is awesome - complete with terrain variations, elements, and explosions. You control all characters in combat which means you aren't just stuck with one playstyle or character type. If you enjoyed the Dragon Age series this game will definitely pique your interest.  The music is awesome and powerfully sets the mood.  The only negative I really have is the pacing can sometimes be slow. Just go into the game with the understanding that it's going to take awhile if you plan on doing most of the content.   Due to how many plot choices and party choices you can make in a playthrough, I just beat it and am already mapping out my next playthrough!"

DarkScythe,330,1,0,"November 27, 2017",Recommended,254.7,"I usually try not to buy games for full price if I can help it, largely because I've been burned repeatedly before by being less than impressed about them afterwards.  I ended up picking up this game for full price (because the first game seemed to absolutely refuse to go on sale for more than 50%.) It supports 4-player coop which is fantastic -- the first game seemed to only allow two. As such, this title is my first entry into this series.  As for whether I feel let down yet, well... it's been 44 hours now, and I still haven't finished exploring the starting island yet, much less figure out how to get off it. I'm having a blast so far; There's a bit of a learning curve if you're not used to Divinity's large amount of inter-play between various game elements, so it feels deeper than your typical RPG's.  The only downside is that things can tend to take absolutely forever early on when you have to spend multiple minutes planning each battle. It almost feels like playing Civ.  I might update this whenever I advance past the starter island..."

Gjunki,12,1,0,March 23,Recommended,201.8,"Can quite honestly say that Divinity 2 is one of the greatest turn-based RPGs of our time. The mesmerising storyline and great character development makes it feel more like a book that you help write an ending to, rather than a standard RPG. The combat system feels very fluid for a turn-based system, and is extremely intuitive (throwing an electric spell on a pool of water will zap everyone standing in it, lighting an oily area on fire have its own array of effects, back-stab with daggers for 100% critical hit chance, positioning yourself at a higher vantage point than the opponent for high-range percent bonus damage, and the list goes on). Would recommend to anyone who wants to add a fantastic RPG to their library of games. Can't wait to play the first, and next, installment."
Althenias,239,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,50.0,"Loved the first game and i feel the sequel took the first and just improved upon it, probably the best D&D style rpg i've ever played, and it's even better with a friends or friends (up to 4 player in main campain).

This game is amazing it puts you right into the game, guides you with just the right amout of tips at the proper moment, so that a tutorial isnt even needed. Game plays well, the combat starts out rather basic, as any game of this genre probably will. If you immidiately started out with complex combat the game would have an even sharper skill curve.  I absolutely love the sanbox/rpg/turnbased combat I was thinking it would be something akin to Hand of the Gods of Hi-Rez studios ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥game imo) but the combat feels as fluid as turn based combat can be; theres no grid that your forced to be on, attacks can be landed at just the right distance between two opponents to hit both, combos are easy to set up and rewarding to pull off, and most of all  This game is actually difficult.

D:OS really surprised me. I fell in love with that game about forty-five minutes into it. Larian is a great dev. They know exactly what they are doing, and I'm guessing D:OS2 takes what the first did well and does it a lot better. . Wonderful to hear that the PC community is loving this game!  Combat is Amazing and fluent, no deadtime and you always have to plan out your moves in advance.Well thought elemental combat system and seeing how every element such as blood,water,oil,steam,smoke,poison or electricity all behave with one another.   Roleplaying is insane. The amount of way you can solve a quest or a simple situation is astounding and the customization of your build is great, however it lacks in physical customization.  Story is really good, engaging and the world reacts to things you do and feels like a living world. You do not need to have played the previous games to understand where it comes from nor where the story goes.  Overall i think this is a great game with a lot of content and replayability, especially with the Gamemaster mode.   To enjoy with friends or alone, this game is a gem."

Better than the first one. It's battles are a mindtwisting masterpiece that forces you to plan every single action you take , more of the best strategy games out there. This game clearly shows how other games we played up until now consisted of cheap battles and rpg elements.  If you want to rush in and complete everyquest and win every battle without proper preparation and thoughtful strategies and hope the game will forgive you, well then this game isn't for you."

Grandpa_Wild,170,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,125.8,"9.5/10 so far... In summary this is a very difficult, detailed game with a high skill cieling, plenty of room for experimentation and variation, and lots of replayability value. One does not have to play the first game to enjoy this one; I have not, for the record.   Good: Never been as obsessed with a game since Witcher 3; however, it has much more replayability value due to the incredibily detailed battle system, the multitude of sidequests, the different companions, and practically infinite builds. This game somehow reminds me of Deus Ex and Fallout/Skyrim in that you can accomplish certain tasks in many different ways, which is most evident in the tags system in dialogue. However, in this game, the character you choose/make, the build you create, and the companions that follow you feed into the choices you will make, the way you will fight, and the way you play the game moreso than any game I've played before. This game really puts the ""role-playing"" in RPG. Also props for taking away my handholds, and, for the most part, getting rid of the giant arrow pointing me where to go and just teling me what to do through dialogue, exploration and experimentation.  Bad: Some of the UI and the save system annoy me: I have accidentally walked somewhere instead of reviving a teammate countless times, and one has to get used to quicksaving a lot. These are minor complaints at worst."

rinks361,141,1,0,"October 26, 2017",Recommended,56.0,"I absolutely loved the first Original Sin and this sequal is even better. It expands heavily on the tactical combat and player choice of the first game in ways that few to no other RPGs of it's kind has ever done. I'm several hours in and have only cleared the initial starting area and apparently there are still HOURS and HOURS of main quests, side quests and other diversions to go. The voice acting is great. The loot is great. The characters are in depth and amazing (even talking to animals you will find that they are highly unique and have diverse voice actors!). The replayability in this game is very high as well as you can always tackle quests and situations in NUMEROUS ways. This game is so far from linear it puts similar games to shame. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet but it would be fun to see how it compares to the first game."

Must be one of the best games for that.           And like Diablo, multiple players can play on the same computer which makes it very appealing! ++ Classless so you can mix and match while you progress and learn new spells ++ Tackle the quests as you see fit (killing or persuasion for example)  + Multiple ways to go from a point A to B.... so one can sneak or go ""swords blazing"" + You can murder everyone without blocking quests givers (killing a guard will not hinder your progression)   +- Story can be uninteresting for some side quests but it is mostly very good  - Speaking of which: story can be hard to follow as you do other side quests - Finding the right trader: it can be tiresome to run from one to another to see what spells they could be selling  -- Understanding at the very beginning how to complete quests (quests markers are strange) can be a chore.

PurpleXVI,650,1,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,179.7,"This is a good game and you should buy it.  ...  Now if you actually want the REASONS why, rather than trusting my impeccable judgment...  Music: AAA+ Graphics: Good and easy to read, amazing design on a lot of stuff. Performance: Pretty good, high settings on a medium-tier setup and it runs just smooth except for one or two rare places where a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of things are happening at once.  And then there's the gameplay and writing. Now, the writing has some ups and downs, but mostly ups. There are one or two places where they tried a bit too hard to make something gross, or got a bit too flowery on the prose, but by and large, the writing works. If you hate a character, you can tell it's because the writers wanted you to feel that way about them, not because the writers couldn't figure out how to make them sympathetic. Storyline's interesting and has enough twists to keep you interested, but with enough info that they're not Shyamalan-esque, rather, you have a good shot at guessing them ahead of time if you're observant, which is satisfying.  The gameplay is... if you liked the original Original Sin's gameplay, take that, then improve it in literally every way. And also prepare to be punished, viciously, if you're playing on Tactician mode(which of course you are, you want the most challenge out of this, don't you?) but encounters rarely feel *frustratingly* difficult. The game will happily let you wade into fights or areas that are way out of your depth, so sometimes you need to step back and gain some levels or gear in other places first, but unless you're actively sabotaging yourself with a build you know to be terrible and have no synergies, there's always a way, it just requires you to think creatively and maybe not engage enemies that are four levels above you AND outnumber you two to one.  The only downsides is that the game is a BIT buggy. Occasionally some fights will hang on start because enemies won't figure out they need to take their turn(only had this happen once in close to 100 hours of play, mind you), some quests won't finish properly(probably because you can sometimes start quests by finishing them or picking them up halfway through their storyline by stumbling on a quest-vital NPC or note), the journal is a bit useless and something is VERY wrong with the lizardman consulate area.  Also loading times in the second area, the Reaper's Coast area, are a bit atrocious due to the size of the area. Even on an SSD.  Still, cosmetic issues, for the most part. GET THIS GAME."

The story is engaging almost entirely through story-telling (it's not highly interesting on its own). The gameplay is tons of fun if you like turn-based combat similar to DnD. You can make your character how you want OR play through as one of the prebuilt characters. If you make your own, fear not, you can recruit up to three prebuilts as other party members and experience their story that way.

Captivating visuals, amusing dialogue, engaging and well-acted companions, a deep combat system, and a not-too horrible story. What's not to like? In every detail you can feel the love Larian poured into this game. Also, you can convince dogs and other household pets that all life is fundamentally meaningless, which elevates D:OS2 into legendary status for me. A++ would recommend."
p0llen,108,1,1,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,39.5,"first serious review in my steam career!   As this games is being hyped AF currently i wanted to add my (more critical) perspective.  Highly anticipated sequel to Larian Games' Divinity: Original Sin 1 that continues the pros and cons of the first iteration. Divinity: Original Sin 2 has been in early access and was recently released to steam as ""full"" title.   Pros:  - good artdesign and graphics  - highly polished, no crashes, bugs, solid performance  - multiplayer (2-4 players) easily set up via steam overlay  - good voiceacting covers more or less all dialogues in the game and the majority of the dialogues are written well  - vast amount of races and classes to choose from during character creation  - heaps of abilities to utilize in combat - fights are highly tactical (different armor classes, combination of elements like water and eletricity) and quite difficult which makes them very engaging  - lots of hidden secrets to discover in the world (caves, shortcuts, loot chests, etc. etc.)  - multiple ways to solve quests (sneaking, slaying, talking)  - neat crafting system  - intense dialogue systems with various dialogue options and different outcome based on your dialogue choice    Cons:  - no ""visible"" character progression on level up as new abilities are exclusively acquired via skill-books that are (rng) looted from enemies or the vicinity leading to the effect that your whole gang levels up but you essentially use the same skills for 5-6 levels or even longer - that can get really boring and grindy eventually  - 0 player guidance which can cause confusion and feeling overwhelmed (quests,  - unfair design decisions, i.e. resurrection of fallen party members post-combat needs to be done with scrolls that are very expensive and hard to get; this greatly slows the whole flow down (note: im certain there is a resurrection spell that can be learned, but you need to find it based on rng - see point above)  - overall sense of ""low powered fantasy"" as your gang is wearing rag armor and no helmets even after 10 hours into the game (which also intensifies the difficulty)  - larian games is famour for their ""humour"" - i sometimes find this style of homour ""childish"" and i think it doesnt really fit into a violent, medieval style world but that of course is personal gusto   all in all a very good RPG with lots of clever ideas, highly functional mechanics and solid storytelling. it does however fall short on character progression and should sometimes offer more guidance for players.   8/10  "

Goose,277,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,161.1,"To say that this is a great game, actually does it a disservice, it is a phenomenally made game with amazing RPG elements and spot on tactical gameplay.   At first I thought the game was a bit overbalanced on the NPC's side,  but ended up finding out that it was just me.  A few key gear purchases and suddenly I was taking out fights that I had an incredibly difficult time before.  The combat does a great job of making you feel powerful while never making it feel easy.  Your tactics matter.  From your choices of companions (and what specializations they have) to the positioning on the battlefield, to trying to create your own ambush instead of getting ambushed is just amazingly done.  The game does not hand hold you along, but at the same time it does not feel hard to keep up with all the different quests and side missions that you have on your plate.  Not every fight is meant to be tackled the first time you see it and the game rewards you for taking out something in an ingenious way with an every increasing power level on your gear.  You are always advancing in one way or another.  I never write reviews, this is probably my first so hopefully that says something.  Such an amazing game, do yourself a favor and buy this!"

He was in the middle interrogating another person with a swordsman by his side and 2 archers on opposite ends of the room ontop wooden platforms.  So eventually I devised a solution through trial and error. I got my weakest character to enter the room causing the boss's dialogue to cause them to enter a conversation. I then snuck in my rogue and back stabbed one of the archers (and turned him into a chicken). Next came my wayfarer, using fossil strike and a fire arrow I blocked the enemy from approaching my backline. Afterwards my summoner made a bunch of creatures. Poison, explosions and madness ensued  While all this was happening the boss was still casually talking, replying to my threat 'That's cute.' with a rogue behind him, 4 summons next to him and a wayfarers crossbow aimed at his skull. On fire no less.  10/10 No regrets best game 2017. I didn't think I needed it, but found out it was all I ever wanted."

I played RPG games before and i couldn't say that i liked them cause most of them had issues (story, graphics) most of them were without any inspiration. But not this game. This game is 20/10. It changed my thoughts about RPG's. Its a should have! You can't miss this scenario and that story. Truly amazing!"

Newberg,257,1,0,"October 25, 2017",Recommended,162.1,"Fantastic strategy RPG that doubles as a platform for online D&D.  Pros: -80 to 100 hour campaign -Massive replay value -Fun and creative turn-based strategy combat -Completely free-form leveling system -After the beginning area you can respec all your characters for free forever -Every line of dialogue is voice-acted, complete with an amazing narrator -Comes bundled with a complete creation kit you can use to make mods, maps, and campaigns -Easy to use co-op, plus a GM mode. -You can kill anyone you want. -No forced morality system. -Quests are very creative and usually have different and interesting outcomes.  Cons: -Tactician mode (hard difficulty) requires you to cheese most fights -Usable items you pick up will automatically be placed on your hotbar, cluttering it unless you manually disable that option -Some quests can be bugged if you accidentally do things before the game expected you to. It's never game breaking, but it can be annoying having unfinished quests cluttering your log. -Ambient voice acting gets very annoying, especially if you are at a vendor sorting out your items to sell and you have to hear the same line from nearby NPC's over and over. -Sometimes it's hard to select specific targets if there's a lot of things near eachother, and the slightest movement of your mouse can accidently change your target just as you cast your ability.   All in all, one of the best RPG's to come out in a long time and I highly recommend it."

Bürgermeister,140,1,0,"October 11, 2017",Recommended,129.1,"At first I was hesitant at getting this. It looks great, and like a lot of fun, but maybe not worth the price. I thought maybe I'd pick up the game on a sale or something.  But I'm very glad I got it.  The story is very rich and there's so many ways to play. I'm excited for my second and third play throughs.   You can steal from anybody, kill anyone, befriend NPCs, talk to your followers if you choose to have them, and each story is different from character creation. Each race is treated differently, you have different dialogue options if you're an Outlaw, or Scholar, or even if you play a smart Wizard, you can persuade people with your smarts, or intimidate people with your strength.   The combat is very fun, and comboing spells and attacks is awesome.  Classes aren't really set in stone either. If you're a Fighter but decide you want to shock people, or grow some wings, you can very much do so.   And the GM mode is amazing.   As a Game Master for D&D games, I've always wanted a game to play it in, to immerse the players, and let them explore with out having to explain every small detail. And this game does it very well. You can create custom items, NPCs (even down to what hat they wear), allies, and customize the pre set maps the game gives you. I would honestly buy a DLC that includes more maps. But there are plently right now, I'm just afraid that through multiple play throughs we'll all think ""Oh, this map again.""  This game is a masterpiece, but it's not perfect.  The combat is very hard, even on the easiest difficulty it sometimes feels like I need to kill a couple NPCs who don't deserve it so I can level up and continue the story. And sometimes this makes the game feel linear. I don't know if I'm missing something, or I chose bad classes for my party, but either way that's a big down side for me.  That being said, at the time of posting this review I'm 71 hours in, and I havent even completed my first play through, which is a good thing. I'm taking my time, exploring the world, talking to every NPC and living the world.  UPDATE (very minor spoilers):  I finished the game, and I have to say while the ending was good, it was very buggy. I was unable to use res scrolls, enemies would teleport everywhere, and some other minor things.  Arx also felt very bland for what it could have been. Driftwood and all of Reaper's Coast felt huge, and there was so much story there, but Arx... You were there for one thing, and that was to beat the game. I tried to find more to do there, I tried to find side quests, just anything, but there was nothing. Maybe I missed stuff, maybe I didn't. Either way I feel the game no longer deserves my original score of 8.5/10.  8/10"

Delu,705,1,0,August 4,Recommended,70.1,"The game is simply amazing and that is pre upcoming Definitive Edition extensive Update.   One thing I would like to see changed/ revised is that often when you get into cinematic style close up conversations, the NPC you talk to is visually cut off in odd places, usually the head. So you happen to talk to a lot of headless NPC's and a large portion of the screen is filled with Text, so instead of listening and enjoying the view often there is an accidental forced focus on that text and only little visible parts of NPC's at odd angles. If it actually works right on the other hand you see the usually bland facial expression of NPC's but still a large portion of the screen is covered with text. It feels like this could be done better in both cases as it disctracts a lot.  Otherwise an amazing game I highly recommend playing."

David Knight,493,1,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,80.9,"Okay, I've been holding off on reviewing this for the game to be fully released. I felt that making a review of an unfinished product would be unfair to the company and their hard work. With that being said...  This game is a single/multiplayer RPG that features ""competitive co-op"", in which you play one of several pre-made characters OR a custom character. From my experience the custom characters have far less story and interactions than the pre-made characters. This is because your race and your origin are one in the same. I feel like this is a lost oppurtunity and makes all the custom characters feel a little more samey than if you could be a dwarf sent to assassinate someone or a lizard that's also posessed by some sort of ethereal being like a demon. Instead we're left with the custom characters having nothing unique about them other than their racial traits. To combat this, the pre-made characters can be of any class and have any ability. Which allows you to play any class you want while retaining the amazing work put into their pre-made stories.   UNFORTUNATELY, there isn't a premade character of each race. There are no undead dwarves, undead lizards, or undead elf companions, Which sucks, since my favorite race is the undead elf (for Corpse Eater on an undead).  The crafting system feels a little less intuitive than before and more divorced from the game and it was a feature I kind of overlooked as I quickly forgot all about it. Though you are reminded of it by ONE quest I came across while playing, but beyond that, you'll run around looting EVERYTHING in hopes that combining things in your inventory will produce SOMETHING of use or value but later, usually while selling things in town, you'll completely forget about what you were doing and sell either all of your ingredients only to remember you were saving them for ""something"".  Beyond these two issues, the gameplay is SOLID! The combat grabs your attention and lets you plan your moves carefully so you can combine abilities and environmental hazards, the voice acting is spot-on, the story is well written and easy to follow. Multiplayer and co-op features a seemless drop-in drop-out system, giving players 2, 3, and 4 control of one (or more) of the companion characters following you around. Multiplayer and singleplayer savegames are interchangable... And the loot. I'm ALWAYS scouring the ENTIRE map for more loot.  Which reminds me, I strongly recommend you read every book and note you find, They sometimes add context to what you see in-game.  So, with all that in mind... Do I recommend this game at it's current sale price of $45? I'm actually torn on this one. I LOVE the game, don't get me wrong. I'm about to go play it RIGHT NOW... but... is it worth $45? That's only $15 less than a AAA game, featuring higher quality graphics, full 3D animation, more cutscenes, a stronger focus on character-integration, usually a more intuitive crafting system, but... it's still a solid RPG and I think EVERY library of RPGs wouldn't be complete without it. SO, to a person who is a die-hard RPG fan, yes... it would totally be worth it but if you're on the fence about this game AT ALL... wait for a sale."
PRID8R,628,1,0,April 15,Recommended,108.2,Love this game. I finished DOS1 and got straight into this one a few days later. Absolutely love both games but DOS 2 takes what made the first game great and turns it up to 11. Combat is extremely fund and quite complex but rewarding. The management of skills allows so much freedom for experimentation. I found myself changing up my charachters completely evey once in a while to see what other playstyles were available.   Absolutely recommend for anyone who liked the original and like rpg's in general. Tactitian mode is a beast though so prepare yourself if you are going down that route.

Young Metro,137,1,0,"October 26, 2017",Recommended,139.4,"First off I should start by mentioning that I'm completely new to the series, never played during beta nor have I ever played dos1.   This game is by far the funnest and most intricate rpg I've ever played, grants you a proper adventure with plently of opportunity to try out different quest paths and exhaust dialogue influenced by the high-fantasy elements affecting the world. Richly written with all this dialogue I love the option to choose between race based dialogue, character trait, or even using the basic ones avaiable to all characters, the twists on the options and the options themselves are beautiful, extending side quests, opening up quests, or even resulting in a consequence later on ingame. I haven't progressed too far in the game so I can't really speak much about it but this is already based off of the 14hrs of gameplay i have thus far (which is increasing in increments of 5 with each passing day) but i'm hooked. Been up until 4am constantly playing because of how grasping this game is.   Overall game has -great adventure with plenty of exporability -rich writing with plenty of dialogue  -plenty of ""oh you can do that?"" moments  - graphic beautiful -great quests - plenty of classes each with a choice of 8 races to choose from (4 plus the undead) with a wide variety to play - hybrid builds  -CREATE YOUR OWN CAMPAIGN  -great challenging combat  my only dislike to this game being that my friends and I, do to different work & school scheds creating our own runs of the game, and i'm unsure if you're able to carry one character over from campaign to campaign. Not a huge deal but sometimes i feel it's better to have say your cleric that you needed for your party brought over to your second game, instead of creating a new cleric altogether."

airkerma,56,1,0,March 23,Recommended,273.8,"This is an excellent game which I really enjoy playing. However, I feel that it does fall short of the first game. Things seem to drag on much longer and I find myself looking up how to get past certain parts routinely. A few puzzles can be fun, but when it's more of a feature than a bug that you either have to look these up or spend hours reading all possible texts, it's gone too far. The battles are easily the best part but again, they're not without drawbacks. Almost anytime you lose it's because you ventured 1 foot outside of where you were supposed to be. Many of these battles are instantly unwinnable until you level up again. It's not even worth testing yourself against a foe one level higher because they'll bust out some insane♥♥♥♥♥♥on you and it's over in a turn. The formations don't seem to stick. They keep reverting to the most useless base formation so that everybody dies at the same time when a cursed fireball comes your way. Finally, I can't seem to save different characters so that if I wanted to have a co-op guy and a single player guy, they overwrite each other. Don't get me wrong, I love the game, I just find that it's overly time consuming to the point where I just look everything up because I don't have 4 hours to burn on some cucks missing sock or whatever."

Scominggregor,204,1,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,102.9,"Ok so during the early Alpha I was extremely concerned about the Magic and Physical armor which blocks CC, damage and status effects. Early on, it was incredibly tedious and there weren't  many ways that you could remove the armor without burning cooldowns or wasting many turns using your basic attacks. Also the enemies had double the armor you had so they would be able to land spells and cc on you much earlier than you could to them.   With that said, that aspect is still part of the game but to a lesser extent. They added new spells to target certain types of armor and overall, it just feels like I can break through the armor easier and be able to use my spells to their full effect. I don't feel as frustrated anymore and I've actually grown to like the armor system because certain enemies have more or less of certain type of armor. Caster will have lots of magical armor so you want to send in your dude with lots of physical attacks and lock him down.   I can't recommend this game enough. This is my third edit of my review (it was kind of a mess in aplha/beta) and in its current state I can absolutely recommend this game because of it's great role play elements and tactical combat."

I'm exttremely happy with the skill balancing that they accomplished before release as I have yet to feel that any of my builds have been as OP as some of the ones I and others came up with in Early Access.  The combat is challenging on Classic Mode and BRUTAL on Tactician, not just because the AI is so good, but because the shear amount of skill options you have at your disposal is nigh overwhelming and I love it!  The voice acting adds a lot, the new animaations for deaths are kick♥♥♥♥♥and I can't wait to move on with the overall story in Act 2.  Also, the real consequences of some of your companions' choices are so very cool - in particular Sebille and Lohse.  I haven't even looked into GM mode yet, but just watching that Matt Mercer video on youtube lets you know how powerful and streamlined that part of the package is.  Almost bug free on my run so far too, which is another huge feather in their cap.  Awesome job again Larian!

Pawnda,262,1,0,February 21,Recommended,420.7,"Although this game is confusing at the very first time I played, especially about questing-story related and class management--this game is big great. This game has unique element of job you play, you will be given a full control of your character you want to be--I mean, you can really mix between one type of class and another to suit your playstyle. The RPG is good, combined with RTS battling system. The story is tailored by how you play it, you can skip the whole part when you want it to be skipped, but note that I don't recommended this whole story skipping thing because you will miss a lot of quest to makes your character strong.  Pros: - Narrator things at conversation like I were reading a book, I like it because I'm a writer, so this one suit me; - The graphics is decent, but not that spectacular, I give it 7/10; - You can talk to every individual, some gives you quest, some gives you lead to something. And every individual you can barter with; - Co-op (multiplayer or split-screen); - Character development, progression and decision making is three things important; - Has hidden things everywhere, puzzles are that makes it a big plus; - Clever AI and challenging environment to fight in; - The linear story is somehow amazing to me, plus there are total six different origin characters that has different story, and at top of that you can create your own character - Worth hours of gameplay (in different playthrough).  Cons: - The conversation system is just not my type; - Lacks of tips and tutorial as this game showed only for previous Divinity players; - Journal seems to be confusing because the finished quest or something like that doesn't moved to Archieved side automatically, and sometimes bugged and can't be done although it's actually done; - It's not friendly for a new player of Divinity series as showed above--lacks of tips and tutorial. You will only see a few of this along the games, and it seems not very helping either; - Some feature you couldn't understand after a few hours of gameplay; - Few minor bug (some related to story that makes it gamebreaking bug, but fortunately there are other way to approach).  9.5/10 hope I played this game earlier xD  EDIT ---  Definitive edition has some major improvement. But yes, no game is perfect.  Pros: + Beast's story is improved a little bit; + Arx got a lotta change; + Sir Lora; + Journal; + Some elements got nerfed and buffed.  Cons: - Changelog says that Retribution should be attractive to enemies, and I don't see the difference. - Bugged quests (as far, I got only two bug, one at the bloodmoon island called ""Shackles by Pain"" or something that we have to fight possesed dwarf. Two at Lohse quest called ""Crippled the Demon, I can't snuff out the candles and the dialog just give me ""turn away"" choice at the first candle. Update: I can snuff out the first candle by using tornado skill, weird, and the second candles snuffed without any problems, the third/ thousand candles are also without problem.)."

"Crouching Panda, Hidden Wallet",178,1,0,July 20,Recommended,98.1,"Holllllllyyyyyy Shieeeeeet  This game is amazing. I haven't even finished one playthrough yet (about 2/3rds done) and I've clocked 74 hrs as of this review. I'll list the positives +In depth Character Creation with more than a dozen different classes, and the options to combine any skills in any class during creation. eg. If you want a highly strung Inquisitor who just happens to be able to turn their arm into a tentacle and wack people with it, you can get that straight off the bat +Great narrative that has a long length, with an old-school DnD DM-like Narrator evoking the emotions and facial expressions of the party and NPCS +Complex choices that have lasting effects +Sikk loot comes often and looks great +The world design is beautiful, varied and surprising. +Well Optimised +Has 4 player Co-Op +Has a mode where you can be an actual DM +Sounds Design is great, a variety of atmospheric tracks, and tempo changes acording to current events. eg. tempo increases during battle +Combat is very very deep and complex, but still fun. Though takes a bit of creativity to really get the game to show its masterful design. Use those arrows, bombs and spells you might otherwise forget!  It would be very hard to list all the great things about the game, but here's a few negatives:  -I have lost server connection with my friend a few times while playing. About 3 times in 70hrs. still not bad, but be aware that you should save often. -It is time consuming, be prepared to forget about some things if you leave space in between play sessions  That's it. This is such a worthy purchase. Please get it"

Deltarizon,104,1,0,April 6,Recommended,175.3,"Well lets start off with a brief description of the game. You're a captive on a ship, a Sourceror, one of the most hated people across the land. Your foul magic attracts monstrosities known as the Voidwoken, nightmares from another dimension that seek to claim this world as their own. However, things quickly roll out of hand, and it ends with the ships destruction. Finding yourself on the prison island known as Fort Joy, you discover that you're no ordinary Sourceror; you have the potential to become a GOD. From there, the game plays out quite literally as YOU choose it, be it as a benevolent hero seeking to save the world or as a malicious villain who seeks to gain ultimate power. And, just maybe, you'll find an option that no one else expected, one that takes you through the Void itself... and finding power that scoffs at the Gods themselves.  As you can probably tell, there's a lot of choices to be made in Divinity 2 : Original Sin, and maybe you're thinking ""Oh god, it's another one of these games that plays out as a visual novel instead of a rpg"". Well if you are thinking that, shut the ♥♥♥♥ up, strap in, and read up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because there's quite a bit more to the game than that.   Now, the best part about this game is it's combat system and character progression; there are few other games where I can actually feel the progression of my character and the impact it has on the world around me. For example, in my very first TRUE playthrough of the game, 100% it, I did it with just two characters, both of them basically assassins; it was hard at first of course, but by the end of the game I could clear a room of 12 heavily armored characters with 2 characters and taking no damage. It truly felt powerful, and is one of my favorite gaming playthroughs of all time. So I thought, ♥♥♥♥ it, lets try a magical playthrough, might not be as fun as the first, but we'll get through it. Well. Lets just say a full elementalist party is quite a unique experience. The whole 4 person party felt powerful the entire game, and we destroyed everything in sight that we deemed ""Unholy"" or ""Unclean"". Felt ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious the entire way through, and I don't regret a moment of it. For my thrid play through, I went in with a full melee team, and got the exact same results, which has blown me out of the water and clear into the sky; the fact that no matter what kind of team you play you know you'll become a force to be reckoned with is fantastic, and lets you cook up some pretty kooky team compilations. If you don't believe me, go on youtube and look up some of the SOLO builds people can make; they play on the highest difficulty and can quite literally nuke entire areas with a single character. But I digress, that's a bit off topic, and not relevant to this review. So if you've ever felt let down by a characters power or capability, trust me, you won't feel that with this game.  Let's talk diversity for a quick second here. There are 4 main races in the world, the Dwarves, Humans, Elves, and Lizards. Each race has its own unique capabilities, and it's own racial traits, meaning that yes, while you can have a Lizard assassin, making it a human so it have bonus initiative (how soon it gets to move in combat) and extra critical chance (random extra damage) means you'll have an easier time. Or maybe you'll choose a lizard for your geomancer because you have the innate ability to breath fire, and ignite your oil based abilities. A dwarven Inquisitor stands ready to rush into your opponents because they have extra defenses against all forms of damage. And maybe your necromancer is an elf because elves can eat parts of their enemies to learn memories and skills they'd normally never obtain. No matter what it is, you'll find tons of combinations based off of race alone to make a unique and fun character. But is that where it stops? Nope, that's where we're just getting started. See, there is a unique twist you can put on a character; you can make them UNDEAD. Yes, that's right, a skeleton that walks and talks, and which offers other unique pros and cons. For example, an undead character will heal when poisoned, and take damage when healed normally. Skeletons can use their bony fingers as infinite use lockpicks. And most importantly, Skeletons don't have any nasty organs to inhale Deathfog, an uncommon terrain in the game which kills anything that breaths it, meaning that Undead are free to wander through it as they please. The only real downside is having to wear a headpiece at all times. (Which isn't even a downside, like, why would you decide to not wear an important piece of equipment?) But lets say you dislike making all of that troublsome character stuff, you just want to get in and have fun. Well, there are already a ton of premade characters with their own stories and quests to go on if you so choose! There's literally no way to go wrong with making a character in this game!  Hey, we almost missed the most important part of the game, the part where you become a god and stuff! Well friendo, that's what I saved for last because that♥♥♥♥♥♥is called SPOILERS, and I know that some people dislike those. So let it be said now that if you don't want to read any spoilers WHATSOEVER, then you should skip the next paragraph. Cool? Cool.  So as your character progresses through the game, they will discover the ability to use Source to fuel abilities. These are their godly powers, and are only usable by player characters and certain other npcs. This includes the abilites; Bless : Buffs an ally and clears any and all curses that afflict them. Spirit Vision : Is actually free to cast, and lets you temporarily see into the spirit realm, where you can see parts of the past, and even talk with the dead to gain their wisdom. (Or even just to taunt an enemy who bugged you.) Devour : Not it's actual name, but I don't use it often enough to remember it. It's also free to cast. You basically target an enemy corpse (or even just directly target their ghost.) and devour their essence, regaining a source point. Doing this too many times however can mark you with the ""Villain"" tag, which is not what you want to have on you if you're roleplaying as a benevolent hero. Gate : Again, isn't the true spell name, but works the same as the D&D version, creating a permanent link to another location within range that anyone can go through at any time. It sounds kind of dumb at first, but it lets you pull off some pretty wacky stunts in the game, and I've taken it on every character I've made so far. There are of course tons of other abilities that can be fueled by source points, far too many to list them all here, as each class has a few ""Ultimate"" abilities that you need source to use. But if you're interested in learning more about these godlike powers, then just look up a class guide and check out their abilities to get an idea of what you can work with!  Alright, well I think that if you've read everything I've said so far, that you'll get the idea I'm trying to tell you. The game's fantastic, and fun to play, especially with friends. One of the best campaigns we had was one where the entire party split up and fought to become the ultimate character. So if you enjoy shennanigans like that, and you love the sound of this game, then take a go at it! I really think that you'll enjoy the hell out of it!"

So far I prefer the Origin characters cause you're getting more story mode for yourself, instead of just your companions. Speaking of which, the characters have great build, personality and of course, story. Ingredients needed for one to be attatched to a character of your choosing, mine for example being The Red Prince.  Allow me to share a funny tale while I am here...  So I'm in a full party and we decide to pick pocket this guy, but our rogue needs us to distract the guards.

frontman12,374,1,0,"December 8, 2017",Recommended,63.4,"7.5/10  I played Divinity: Original Sin 2 with a group of friends as a Persuasive Lizard, focusing on Summoning and Geomancy. Though the boulders and oil that can be thrown with Geomancy are effective, I initially focused on it to serve as a healer for our Undead tank. Undead are healed by poison, so your party's usual healer can't help them out. However, Geomancy also gave me access to Fortify which I could use to restore physical armor, and Artillery Plant, which was my favorite thing in the game. Artillery plant is a summon that exists in the Geomancy tree, whose level is determined by your Summoning skill. In the game, your most powerful skills cost ""source"" to cast (sort of a special type of mana). By the end of the game, you will be able to possess three source points at a given time. Source is rare to come by during most of the game, and even towards the end it's not necessarily unlimited. Artillery plant costs a single source point to cast, but then it can cast an extremely powerful spell called ""Acid Spores"" every two turns, among other strong abilities. If your character were to cast ""Acid Spores,"" instead of the summon, it would cost you two source points every time!  The type of discussion you see above is what makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so exciting. How can you support the other characters in your party in combat, and what is the optimal way to use your source or action points? If a member of your party has the ""Loremaster"" ability, you can examine enemies to learn their abilities, talents, and resistances. If an enemy reduces and redirects damage dealt, you may want to attack his friends first. If he has the opportunist talent, you do not want to walk away from melee range as it grants him an attack. If he has a fire resistance of 150%, fire will heal him. You want to constantly take stock of enemy composition and the skills of your party.  If Divinity: Original Sin consisted of a more linear story with more combat encounters, and lasted about 2/3 of its current length, it would be a 10/10 game for me. However, as it stands, I have a few gripes.   Although I'm sure that many players appreciate the ability to complete quests in multiple ways, I just found it frustrating. Some of the solutions are obtuse, and require a lot of poring through documents. Some of the late game puzzles, like pulling levers in a certain order or playing the enormous ""pipe dream"" game, were just tedious. There are many many quests, and in a multiplayer party it just felt like I was always receiving experience from somewhere because someone in my party was progressing on one of the many many quests in my quest log. While I'm sure some might say that I should've played with a different group of people, there are so many quests with so many solutions that often we made quest progress by aimlessly walking around.   Another issue I had with the title is just how quickly my character advanced. Each character has a maximum of 40 in an attribute, a maximum of 10 in each skill or combat ability, and a maximum of 5 in each civil ability. Each character in our party maxed out at least one of these categories well before the end of the game. In addition, the highest tier of skills in the game become available at level 16, also well before the endgame. Though perhaps others are drawn primarily for the story, this severely hampered my enjoyment of the game. After learning all skills I was interested in, maxing my summoning and my persuasion, I just didn't have as much to look forward to.  I enjoyed most of my time with Divinity: Original Sin 2. The argument could be made that this type of game just isn't for me, but I enjoyed the combat so much that is was worth some of the other irritations."

PLayed the D:OS EE when it came aout and found this already supererb but the 2nd part can even top this. The story is awesome, the level of detail and the love the developers packed in almost everything is just mind blowing. You can spent hours just listening to characters, speaking with NPCs and enjoy the environment. Not that you have to, but you can. where you have to follow dialogs for quests they are to the point but entertaining and really drag one into the game.  PLayed the storyline in Coop with a friend (2-2) and also the coop gameplay is double+. turn based combat along with the deep strategy and knowledge of your skills make fights extremly challengeing and rewarding at once. Sometimes a fight can take an hour - but you won't feel it.

LouskRad,"3,694",1,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,165.8,"Simply amazing.   In terms of strorytelling, this rpg provides an immersive experience with a story you won't guess from the first gameplay hour. It's epic and it's character dependent (to a point). The optional pre-made characters enrich this story, even if the player does not play one (they can also be rectuited as party members).  In terms of rpg gameplay dynamics, the potential this game offers for character skill variation can result in absurdly overpowering characters, yet the level progression system somehow compansates; resulting in a feeling of powermonger.  On top of these, all dialogues are voice acted, graphics are beautifully stylized (ne can especially find the richly colorful style goes quite interesting with story) and the game camera works wonders.  As a result, I was quite happy that I backed this game and it was honestly better than I expected."

RayIgnis,128,1,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,248.8,"Highly recommended to fans of rpg and turn based games. Do you need to play the first game or any Divinity title before this? Not at all ,you can learn more about the world as you play along. Play alone (like i do since friends didnt come with the game) or play coop which your friends can drop in and out anytime or get straight into the fight with the PVP Arena mode.    The good stuff:  -Interesting main/side story and meaningful quest (no more of that boring fetch or kill this mobs quest) -Play as 1 of the 6 origin character which have predefined backstory and unique events. -Or create your own and team up with those origin character. -Dynamic relationship system which your companion can either hate/like you or if you like become intimate with -Owh did i mention that you can play as an undead that ripped other people face to use as a mask? (both origin and custom character) -Your choice and action effect the story and the game (so dont think that people will not notice that apple you just stole) -Challenging combat which force you to use every trick up your sleeve (no more potion/scroll etc that you will probably never use till the end) -Do things your way.Be persuasive,do favors or even do the exact opposite of that favor or just kill the guy and loot him its up to you. -Fully voice acted and beautiful soundtrack that fits the theme of the world -Alot of other interesting stuff like crafting,surface effect etc that you can use to your advantage or be use againts you. -Explore the world and be rewarded for it or suffer for it (who knows,you could find a curse helmet that may contain an evil spirit inside it)    The bad and not so bad stuff:  -Bugs,this game is not totally free of them.I havent found any game breaking bugs yet but remember to keep saving every 15-30 min or so.F5 quicksave is your friend here dont relied on autosave to much.  -The combat difficulty can sometimes spike alot that it can be brutal to new players,i suggest starting the game on the easiest mode (Explorer mode) and get a good feel of the game first before jumping on the more harder one like Classic mode.  -The armor system seem to have alot of mix opinion among the community (Its was absent in the first game).What this system does is that you cant apply debuff like stun to the target unless you destroy their magical armor or physical armor depending on the debuff.The good thing  is that it also apply to your party meaning that your 250 physical armor warrior can just go in and cut down those archer at the back without the fear of being knocked down and your party dont have to be feared of being 1 shotted by some enemy mage AoE spells at the start of the fight.The bad  thing is that enemy usually have 2x or sometimes more armor than you,this forced the player to make a burst dmg character to quicky remove that armor which in turn  limiting the player to mix their classes without hurting the dmg potential the character can dish out per turn.   Overall the game get a solid 9/10 from me and 1 of the few game i dont mind paying more money.Unlike some of the game that we get now that doesnt fit the unreasonably high price tag (Looking at you *AAA games*)"

Pawnda,262,1,0,February 21,Recommended,420.7,"Although this game is confusing at the very first time I played, especially about questing-story related and class management--this game is big great. This game has unique element of job you play, you will be given a full control of your character you want to be--I mean, you can really mix between one type of class and another to suit your playstyle. The RPG is good, combined with RTS battling system. The story is tailored by how you play it, you can skip the whole part when you want it to be skipped, but note that I don't recommended this whole story skipping thing because you will miss a lot of quest to makes your character strong.  Pros: - Narrator things at conversation like I were reading a book, I like it because I'm a writer, so this one suit me; - The graphics is decent, but not that spectacular, I give it 7/10; - You can talk to every individual, some gives you quest, some gives you lead to something. And every individual you can barter with; - Co-op (multiplayer or split-screen); - Character development, progression and decision making is three things important; - Has hidden things everywhere, puzzles are that makes it a big plus; - Clever AI and challenging environment to fight in; - The linear story is somehow amazing to me, plus there are total six different origin characters that has different story, and at top of that you can create your own character - Worth hours of gameplay (in different playthrough).  Cons: - The conversation system is just not my type; - Lacks of tips and tutorial as this game showed only for previous Divinity players; - Journal seems to be confusing because the finished quest or something like that doesn't moved to Archieved side automatically, and sometimes bugged and can't be done although it's actually done; - It's not friendly for a new player of Divinity series as showed above--lacks of tips and tutorial. You will only see a few of this along the games, and it seems not very helping either; - Some feature you couldn't understand after a few hours of gameplay; - Few minor bug (some related to story that makes it gamebreaking bug, but fortunately there are other way to approach).  9.5/10 hope I played this game earlier xD  EDIT ---  Definitive edition has some major improvement. But yes, no game is perfect.  Pros: + Beast's story is improved a little bit; + Arx got a lotta change; + Sir Lora; + Journal; + Some elements got nerfed and buffed.  Cons: - Changelog says that Retribution should be attractive to enemies, and I don't see the difference. - Bugged quests (as far, I got only two bug, one at the bloodmoon island called ""Shackles by Pain"" or something that we have to fight possesed dwarf. Two at Lohse quest called ""Crippled the Demon, I can't snuff out the candles and the dialog just give me ""turn away"" choice at the first candle. Update: I can snuff out the first candle by using tornado skill, weird, and the second candles snuffed without any problems, the third/ thousand candles are also without problem.)."

Dellecross,14,1,0,April 28,Recommended,21.7,"TL;DR  7/10 score from my side.  Longer read  - It is a good RPG game. It follows good ways of approaching the genre. And it attempts to fix problems the first game had. - There are some things which still call for improvements. But it's probably not something which will make you hate the game.  Very long read  Awesome:  - Story. Well, this is as much as it states. Who doesn't want to become a divinity? And you decide which path do you take to get there. - Combat geometry. Altitude and different surfaces make it feel great and diverse. You really want to position yourself right. You really want to make use of surfaces or prevent enemies from doing it. And in most of the cases  - you can/ - Voice acting. They have every little dialog covered and I think at least 7-8 different voices, that's great - Game looks. It is about world and is applicable for those who have fairly good PCs. Speaks for itself.  Good - They improved the initiative problem. As any turn-based game, the turn order will make it a problem of stacking the speed/initiative/whatever serves the turn order boost. Here it's no more so much of an issue. - Many immunity talents are removed which is a good decision. It's just too much of a mandatory pick in the first game. - Not such huge power creep. Over the course ov the levels, like till 15-16, you don't feel the exponential numbers growth. So it makes it managable to plan the combat - Minor fixes like ranged weapon influencing bows AND crossbows. It may be not so impressive, but when combined - it leaves a good feeling  Not-so-good (what made it 7 out of 10)  - Cannibalist elves. I mean, yes, one can argue ""you live with stereotypes"" - and I can't deny it's partly so, but look - if you're taking a race which is invented long before you and make it into something that's completely opposing the perception of majority - it will get tricky. If they would not call these guts-devouring people elves I would have no questions. But it's a bit over the board  - Overall game characters design. Lucky me, I play male characters where appearance means not so much. But I would imagine a disappointment for those who plays female characters. I just wonder how they managed to create face presets which seem to compete each other in ugliness. Oh well - it's about personal tastes, sure - but still.  - Items and loot. It is just too... random. It's hard to find something appealing for your character - you will always have that redundant parameter you want to replace. And may be it's not a problem for those who play a lot, but for 10-15 hours of play it may be an issue  - They removed one of the best things I liked in the first game - the D&D-like saving throws. Instead there are these magic/physical armor concepts which just looks too... simplified and makes many magic abilities weak. Especially if the damage-dealers are physical-type (rangers, fighters)  Overall - I would recommend you this game. It is worth the full price. It has it's flaws, but it follows the best canons of an RPG-type game and it won't leave you disappointed. If you're not so much into customisation and aren't obsessed with the perfection of how your avatar looks - then the visuals of this game is one of the best you can find in the genre. If you're fine with simplification of the effects/counter-effects part of the combat - you'll like the new armor system. But in any case - if you like RPG - you'll like this game"

Regina,89,1,0,February 26,Recommended,192.6,"It's been a very, very long time since a game enthralled me like Divinity: Original Sin 2 has. I love a good RPG but they tend to feel like more of the same after you've played enough of them. Not Divinity, though. I found myself unable to turn away right from the get-go, wanting to turn over every single stone, search every crevice before moving on - and I'm sure there's still plenty of secrets I missed. I had over 12 hours logged before I'd even escaped the fortress for the first time.  The gameplay is engaging, the story compelling, the music enchanting, and the world a true work of beauty. I haven't felt this way about a game since I picked up Dungeon Siege off a Walmart shelf back in the early 00's."

"""\(o.o)/""",46,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,167.4,"Honestly, probably the best game I've ever played. Here's why:  -The graphics and spell animations are amazing and hairrising!  -Epic storyline.  -The fights are satisfying as hell, and you play by your own rules, and your techniques. Whether that being to just stand face to face to the enemy, or hide behind walls and place traps to checkmate.   -You can fail quests in this game, but it won't make you lose or have to redo everything.  -You choose your style of playing, you can be the kindhearted hero who helps everyone and doesn't harm a fly. Or you could kill every single person you can find, you can still proceed in the story, although they may have different outcomes.  -There's a way around everything, stuck somewhere? For example [SPOILER ALERT]  If you kill Migo, his daughter won't give you any keys, but you could always steal the keys or kill her, and other than that, there are atleast 1 more way inside.  -The way the elements work is logical and epic, throw a water baloon at someone, then cast a cold spell, poof, they're ice (unless they have resistances)  -You don't need to know a single thing about the first game, in fact, I never even knew about divinity: original sin before this came out, nor have I cared to play it, and I'm totally fine.   -Doing kind acts that won't seem to give you anything in return (such as giving free gold to a random npc), are most likely to give you something in return in the long run. Such as discounts for what they're selling.  -Choosing your skills and talents can make your story go in a different direction. I mean, there's a talent for speaking to animals...who don't wanna talk to their pets??? And sometimes they also have important information  :)  -I could go on but I'm lazy and I wanna play now...so..ye...xD  (This is the first review I've ever done, and I've owned steam for MANY years, that should say something about the game)"

Jestertitan,37,1,0,May 11,Recommended,396.6,"I have been a Steam member for, oh I'd say 15+ years, and have never cared enough to write a review.  I am so passionate about this game that I felt inspired enough to write my thoughts.  You can get the highlights from other reviews, but I just want to share my feelings because I'm very meticulous when I buy a new game and I read all these reviews.  I have over 350 hours into this game so far, and I'm still on my FIRST PLAYTHROUGH!  Now, this is due to my playstyle.  If you wanted to blast through the game I'd imagine I could in 50 hours or so, but I like to get all I can out of a game, and boy does this game have a lot.  Between the music, phenomenal gameplay, graphics (mine are low though because my computer sucks), and mostly the story.  What a great story.  Up there and maybe even better than witcher 3.  I put 700+ hours into skyrim and I can see myself playing through this game another few times to top that, and I haven't even gotten into the multiplayer yet.  If you like RPGs and turn-based games, or story-rich games, then this is for you.  There are so many variations you can play through between all the different builds, skills, spells, potions, crafting, etc.  This game is right now my favorite of all time, or at the very least top 5 all time of any game type, and I consider myself a moderately hardcore gamer with decades of experience gaming.  You will not regret this purchase.  People say there are bugs but I personally have not experienced any.  Most of the time people complaining about bugs is them just missing something, be it a hidden door, or stat effect that they don't know changes something.  I haven't experienced a single bug, maybe because I bought the game late after fixes.  Either way, buy this.  You won't regret it."
Snakat,136,1,1,January 14,Recommended,165.2,"Very awesome game. Single player is over 100 hours and a great comeback for CRPGs. Game has lots of replayablity as there are multiple routes for quests and characters and you can only bring 4 (if you pick pre-made yourself) along each play through. Multiple player is also a super nice addiction to CRPGs and having 4 people is almost like playing DnD on the computer.

WamBamShookeran,72,1,0,August 22,Recommended,106.7,"This is a great game with some nearly game-breaking flaws. There were a decent amount of bugs in my playthrough. The combat is mind-numbingly slow. The stories are just okay IMO, maybe that's because there are so many stories going on that it can be hard to fully get into one, maybe it's just a ""me"" problem. I was tempted to go back and playthrough again, but I'm not very interested at this point, hopefully in the future I will be ready for round two. My playthrough was somewhat completionist (in that I completed every quest I came acrossed), and apparently took a hundred hours. That is a pretty long game! While the play time was long, the story itself felt somewhat short, or stilted. Perhaps it's because there are not that many regions/maps to play, perhaps it was because the slow combat effected the rest of the game so much. I really enjoyed the creative level design and the ability to go about things in a variety of ways, with only one playthrough under my belt I'm sure that I missed a lot of these extra details. There is no throwaway function in the game, which was a breath of fresh air. I expected spirit vision to be a one-and-done or very limited use mechanic but it comes into play all the time.   If they would fix the pace of the combat this game could be vastly improved, hopefully either the developer or modders will come up with a solution.

Just to say I`m one picky bugger when it comes to games but even I can`t help but give this game a 10/10, If you like RPG`s, with deep dialogue and witty, interesting stories and great fast moving and at times complex combat tactics this game is for you.  If it was 3D, And this world was put inside the Skyrim engine I`m not sure alot of people would ever get any work done me included."

mypony89,35,1,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,30.1,"EDIT: Giving this a thumbs up now, not because larian changed anything, though they have fixed a couple of bugs, but because of the mods coming out for it. Larian laid the foundation and gave a great game but the modding community makes it better.    Good game,.   In my opinion the armor system makes the game tedius.  I don't believe it was well thought out.   The way armor works is that each mob has physical armor and magical armor, then they have their health.  No crowd control that deals with physical attributes will work on a mob unless the physical armor is 0.  The same goes for magical armor and crowd control for magical attributes.  Armor also keeps mobs from being hurt, so as long as they have any armor on they won't recieve damage.   For physical armor you destroy it by beating them with weapons and a select number of spells, (remember the effect of those spells won't do anything through) and to destroy magical armor you have to hit it with spells in order for magical effects or damage to be felt.  Once the armor is destroyed you can then damage their health and inflict status effects.  This may sound great but in the end it leads to tedius battles.  Wade in, hit the mob with swords as that is the easiest way to destroy the armor, then crowd control.  There is NO chance a status effect won't work once armor is gone.  The person or NPC is pretty much dead after that.    For me this just ruins the fun of what I have come to love and enjoy about D;OS, being able to expirement with different spells and effects to see how I can control the battlefield, (or be controlled.)  This also means that traps do almost nothing.  I just walk through them because they don't hurt.  Poison, who cares.  Electic field, ok, fire, sounds lovely to stroll through, as long as my armor is ok.  Outside of combat its easy to keep your armor up.  Everything else about the game is fine.  As for me though, I think I'm going to have to wait till a mod comes out that fixes the issues I've talked about which makes me sad since I spent over $150 in order to download and buy the game.  ($44 for game, $60 for data and another $60 when I need more data since I was having to use a tethered phone.)"

Pebble,64,1,1,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,174.9,"This game is an unchallenged masterpiece which single handedly has saved the rpg, dungeons-and-dragons-esque style that many people love and many games fail to pay homage to.  Story: When I decided to replay the game I expected to run into the same encounters and same experiences again so that I could make better choiced. However, that went♥♥♥♥♥♥up when I made 1 or 2 tiny different choices and ended up getting completely new missions and encounters, it was as if I was playing an ENTIRELY new game!  Performance: I have just above the recommended hardware for this game and for the 100+ hours that I have played this game not once have I had to lower the graphics from the highest setting and I am always getting 60+ frames.  Controls: Although overwhelming at first, the controls become natural relatively quickly and can be utilised as you see fit, I have run into no inconveniences so far. However it did take a few hours to get used to having to use the middle mouse button so much! (middle mouse used to swivel camera)  Overall the game is near flawless and I don't see myself getting bored of it any time soon! :)"

Hotshot,99,1,0,June 29,Recommended,177.3,"Narrative: DOS 2 has a true fantasy story. It is one steeped in mystery and pushes the boundaries of creativity.  Each character has a unique subplot completely entangled with the main story. The side quests tie in with the games central themes and main narrative very well. Accordingly, they dont seem out of place or tacked on but are very believeable in the world crafted by larian studios. Music: The music works. It sets the tone quite nicely for the various parts of the world. It goes from epic to playful to somber to tragic in parallel with the envirement or scenario. Gameplay: The gameplay is very strategic with nuanced application. You must defeat intelligent and powerful Antagonists. Your set of abilities can be used envirementaly and you must keep your wits about you for the entirety of the game for both battle and exploration.  Characters: the ensemble cast of main characters each have their own ambitions, dreams, and philosophy. They are not just along for the ride. If you dont want to play as one of them you can create a character whose complexity and depth extends as far as yourself. Most if not all of the NPCs have believable ambitions and reasons for either deterring you or assisting you. there are many factions of npcs and 2/3 of them will seek your destruction depending on your choice so replayability is permitted. I have finished this game once and this is a reflection of that experience.  Since this is truly a great game, I wish everyone to play through and experience its wonders, for that is why I recommend the exploration mode for anyone that is turned off by the difficulty, so they can focus on exploration. I say that because the world and its characters are a spectacle to behold. This is the purest Role Playing Game i have played and I look forward to the future of its developer, Larian Studios."

Pawnda,262,1,0,February 21,Recommended,420.7,"Although this game is confusing at the very first time I played, especially about questing-story related and class management--this game is big great. This game has unique element of job you play, you will be given a full control of your character you want to be--I mean, you can really mix between one type of class and another to suit your playstyle. The RPG is good, combined with RTS battling system. The story is tailored by how you play it, you can skip the whole part when you want it to be skipped, but note that I don't recommended this whole story skipping thing because you will miss a lot of quest to makes your character strong.  Pros: - Narrator things at conversation like I were reading a book, I like it because I'm a writer, so this one suit me; - The graphics is decent, but not that spectacular, I give it 7/10; - You can talk to every individual, some gives you quest, some gives you lead to something. And every individual you can barter with; - Co-op (multiplayer or split-screen); - Character development, progression and decision making is three things important; - Has hidden things everywhere, puzzles are that makes it a big plus; - Clever AI and challenging environment to fight in; - The linear story is somehow amazing to me, plus there are total six different origin characters that has different story, and at top of that you can create your own character - Worth hours of gameplay (in different playthrough).  Cons: - The conversation system is just not my type; - Lacks of tips and tutorial as this game showed only for previous Divinity players; - Journal seems to be confusing because the finished quest or something like that doesn't moved to Archieved side automatically, and sometimes bugged and can't be done although it's actually done; - It's not friendly for a new player of Divinity series as showed above--lacks of tips and tutorial. You will only see a few of this along the games, and it seems not very helping either; - Some feature you couldn't understand after a few hours of gameplay; - Few minor bug (some related to story that makes it gamebreaking bug, but fortunately there are other way to approach).  9.5/10 hope I played this game earlier xD  EDIT ---  Definitive edition has some major improvement. But yes, no game is perfect.  Pros: + Beast's story is improved a little bit; + Arx got a lotta change; + Sir Lora; + Journal; + Some elements got nerfed and buffed.  Cons: - Changelog says that Retribution should be attractive to enemies, and I don't see the difference. - Bugged quests (as far, I got only two bug, one at the bloodmoon island called ""Shackles by Pain"" or something that we have to fight possesed dwarf. Two at Lohse quest called ""Crippled the Demon, I can't snuff out the candles and the dialog just give me ""turn away"" choice at the first candle. Update: I can snuff out the first candle by using tornado skill, weird, and the second candles snuffed without any problems, the third/ thousand candles are also without problem.)."

Lain,147,1,0,"October 29, 2017",Recommended,317.0,"REVIEW UPDATED AFTER GAME COMPLETION -----------------  +Same excellent, engaging combat system as the first game. Some expanded functionality +Some quality of life UI changes which make everything better +Better skills / attributes system which makes character creation more flexible +VO in the initial release (as opposed to being added in EE of D:OS) +2 player co-op was fun; 4 player co-op is awesome +When I first reviewed this game I said the story was ""marginal at best"" part way through Act 2. I've since changed my view on this; the characters develop very nicely through the rest of the game, and all of the plotlines of the individual characters tie up really nicely by the end. There were lots of things in the game that really made me say ""Wow. These developers really poured their blood and tears into this."" However....  -I do feel the game was a bit too long. 160 hours for one playthrough was tedious, and I put the playthrough on pause for a few months and came back to it. I think they could have done without Act 3 entirely, and done a second mega act in Act 4. The playtime also would be significantly mitigated by the below mentioned quality of life changes. -Simple things like: please don't allow lucky charm to roll on equipment. It's super annoying to switch gear / drink alcohol everytime I want to look something. -Still an inventory management simulator. Developers should really break out crafting ingredients into its own menu / sorting system. I spent a lot of time crafting scrolls, potions, and grenades as combat contingencies for Honour and this would have made a big difference in my gameplay experience. -Skillbook description poorly communicates spell range, making it hard to figure out the best skills for a build -Huge minus: crafting system is incomplete. Why can i only craft chest pieces, and not gloves / legs / helmets? Why are so many recipes that were in the first game missing from this one? -Huge minus: buggy as hell. Should have stayed in Early Access longer to fix these.  I originally reviewed this game as 7.5 / 10. I'm going to go with 8.5 / 10 with my revised view of the story / characters. With QOL changes and a tighter playtime, the next instance of this franchise could easily be a 9.5+ masterpiece. I'm very excited and will definitely be contributing to a kickstarter if there is one."

Big Daddy BeefDick,82,1,0,March 2,Recommended,263.6,"Fantastic Game if you're into RPGs. They took Divinity Original Sin and made it better it most aspects. The game is engaging all the way through and provides hours upon hours of game play with different ways of getting things done. The new restructure of Stats and Abilities makes you feel alot more in line with where you should be compared to other creatures of your level without feeling broken.   They simplified the way a lot of things work and the only one that irked me was Crafting. Crafting in Divinity Original Sin and Enhanced Edition really brought a lot to the game with money making and being able to stack resistances to make up for lower end gear that you just couldn't find an Upgrade for. In Divinity Sin Original Sin 2 you can forget about that and weapon enchants are down to just Two methods. Poison Barrel or an Eternal Object for Lightning. Poison Barrel adds Poison damage which honestly hurts for a ton of fights where you're partially healing the creature you're damaging(Undead).  The Dev Team is great, even after being released as a full game for this long they are still pumping out Bug Fix Patches and Game Balance Patches which shows they care about the Game and what the Community thinks.  I'd give this game an 8/10, Larian Studios really knows what they're doing."

Every small upgrade you choose makes a big difference. Its a little poor when it comes to the face/hair customization but the other things makes up for it    Gameplay 9.8 Gameplay is smooth and feels immersive. Especially the dialogues and the impact it can have in most cases. The turn-based action gives you alot of time to think for the right moves and it's a game where you can relax and not just button mash your way through like Diablo. The ability to play with your friend(s) through the game is also very enticing. The reason I took away 0.2 of the score is because it can be quite confusing for newbies to find out what to do (especially if you haven't played Divinity 1 before)    Graphics 9.9 Suprisingly good graphics even up-close, but the ""Deathfog"" is annoying to watch while the camera is moving which is why I took away 0.1 score. Fortunately you won't see too much of it   Optimization 10 Very good optimization, with ""High"" settings I don't even notice frame drops in fights with alot of things going on.

This game can surprise you in so many ways that you never imagined, be it someone yelling ''Show me your boobs!'' or discovering that you can apply nails to your boots. At first I thought this was just another ''hooray it's good'' but sucks game but actually it's one of my favourite games now that it really started rolling. All I want to play now is DOS2. Playing Co-op is even more fun, be it trolling your friends or goofing up stuff by accident.  Definetely worthy of purchase for anyone who's interested in rpgs. Turn based combat gives the game a nice tactical layer and makes you think your moves, really nice flavor for the game. Be it comboing your spells and elements or backstabbing and stealing stuff from people. The fact that quests aren't handheld and really shown you on the map and told you exactly what to do in questlog keeps you interested in conversations and game overall."

The possibilities of problemsolving to almost everything are huge. And of course its played best with some friends who each have their own main character and own questlines.

Fayt,148,1,0,"December 19, 2016",Recommended,164.9,"Updating my review yet again as early acess and patches come thru. This will be edit number 4 after completing the first set once again.   Many of my initial complaints have been addressed at this point. Dialogue is much improved and even good enough to make the sub characters feel like real characters. They each had small story points in the opening that made it feel like they were actually progressing a bit more with you on your journey compared to attack bots you used in battle. They are still not fully fleshed out but it is early access.  Items/Gear/Spells are WAAAAYYYY better this time around. I was not spending the entire time struggling to find gear to use and feeling forced to have barter and thievery maxed just to try to keep my characters functioning. I did have trouble finding decent weapons for my 2hnd Knight while I got more crossbows than I knew what to do with but some RNG is expected. I felt the early parts of the game were also improved to not feel so brutal to get your first couple levels. I had only a few glitches or bugs along the way as well. (Ben Encourage refused to hit 2 out of my 4 party members for example and Electric discharge seemed to jump way off screen instead of to another enemy), but over all completely functional with lots of different ways to approach things or if you are like me do them all.   I did still have a few complaints that still are around. For one the combat does feel really one sided. Hit armor then CC lock and win. This strat worked on every fight but the last which it still worked just wasn't 100% one sided. The single time I died on the playthrough was the opposite happened to me. I didn't even use a single turn on my side just got to watch the enemy with infinite turns CC lock kill me till party wipe. So I didn't get a lot out of the gameplay combat itself.   This is still exasperated by the fact you can only customize your starting character. You are allowed to choose your other characters jobs when they first join, but you can't tweak or customize anything so the 3 party members I grabbed had some useless traits no matter what I choose I ended up just trying to pick the least painful loss among them. So It took till around level 4-5 till I felt like I had a team I really did enjoy using with the skills and traits I wanted.   Overall it was still a lot of fun this time around. I was expecting this to be a bit more painful at first every once in a while comming back to this game to see how it progressing while knowing we have no clue about release date. However, I enjoyed this playthru enough to finish and be reminded why I wanted to support the early access in the first place.   P.S. If Larian is reading this Please Please PLEASE add a main story Dwarf! I do feel a little left out while the premade characters have unique story situations, but I can't get them on a dwarf!"

Sargonist,51,1,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,62.8,"Very VERY Good game. Exciting, Story Driven, great customization.. The only thing id say about it, and its NOT a negative, is its VERY HARD. If you create a HERO, and DON'T build him/her correctly & a good mix of party members, you MIGHT find yourself stuck, dying every direction you choose to go the first few hours. In fact you might have to start over a few times. Choices MATTER so MUCH, Saying the WRONG thing to the WRONG person can spell disater VERY quickly. Tread conversations with Most anyone very CAREFULLY. I reccomend researching the kind of build you want and forming a very good party to mix them in with. The Voice acting is INSANE, EVERYONE has a voice, and conversations rarely follow the same route with each different party member.  I only have 10+ hours in this game, but i can tell the REplay value is  going to be great. Another thing, is multiplayer seems to need a little ironing out.. So if youre buying this for Solo, GO FOR IT.. Multiplayer? UNLESS you have  FOR SURE Friend(s) to play with, id hold off on Multiplayer with RANDOMS for now. All in All, id say buy this game ASAP..  its worth every penny..  This is like.. my 2nd review.. so sorry if its lame.

Raalah,245,1,0,July 9,Recommended,218.8,"I slept on this game for about 6-7 months. Heard countless reviews on various YouTube channels about how amazing it was. I shrugged it off. I wasn't crazy about the original DoS (honestly I think it was just not the right time for me for it, and I plan to go back now after putting time into DoS2) so I just said ""nah, I don't need to play this"".   Steam summer sale walks in and says ""hey man, you wanna buy this for 20% off?"" and I go ""okay, okay, OKAY!, FINE"". Still, it sits installed on my PC for 3 weeks and I hadn't touched it at all outside of just looking at character creation for 5 minutes and then turning it off...  Then... Yesterday afternoon, I start it up for real and play for an hour solo - I message my best friend and tell him it seems fun and maybe we could play multiplayer together. THIRTEEN HOURS LATER its 2am and I'm logging off only because I have to go to work at 7am.  We had SO much fun with this game. The breadth and depth of roleplay options, the robust combat systems, the meaningful character development through leveling and quests...  Superb game. Definitely would recommend.

Super Elephant,107,1,1,July 5,Recommended,140.0,"D:OS 2 is a thrilling and beautful adventure across the fictional land of Rivellon in search of becoming the next divine. The combat is deep and unique, and especially more fun on the higher difficulties where more strategy is involved. The voice acting is spectacular, particularly with the main cast of pre-generated characters.   However, where the game falls flat is its lack of originality in the main storyline. Esentially it brings upon the typical ""hey theres a bad guy and hes bad and powerful and we gotta be more powerful to defeat him"", with a few extra bits thrown in there. It continues like this until the later acts where it picks up. Thankfully, there are individual character stories that take place between for those before mentioned pre-generated characters, if you happen to have any in your party.  Overall, being a $45 title with easily 65+ hours content on just your first play through alone, this game is easily worth the price. And even being, there is an upcoming ""enhanced edition"" which is said to improve on the main story. I cannot recommend this game enough, despite its downfalls in the story and is easily in my top 3 games of all time."

Bittereinder,149,1,0,March 13,Recommended,96.2,"2017 was a good year for gaming, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the reasons for that. This RPG features top-down turn-based combat that is reminiscent of Temple of Elemental Evil, except that the encounter design here is much more varied and imaginative. The game actively encourages you to find creative solutions, sometimes things that would be considered 'cheesing' in other games, and rewards you for doing so. I found myself purposely trying to provoke fights sometimes, as they were just so much fun.   Compared to the first game, the writing is much better and more entertaining, and most of your potential companions are likeable and interesting - the resolution of Lohse's personal quest was genuinely moving. The animations, sound design and voice acting are top-notch across the board.  The main story didn't grip me quite as much, but it served its purpose of moving things along.   Of course, no game is perfect, and D:OS 2 is no exception. The loot level-scales to such an extent that a legendary axe at level 14 is worse than a regular grey axe at level 16. It means you won't experience the joy of finding a particularly good piece of equipment that will last you half the game, which is part of what made the old Infinity Engine games so fun. It also means it's a good idea to visit a vendor every time you level up, or you quickly risk falling behind. All that time spent shopping can get tedious.  I also have some issues with the way Source is handled in this game. Replenishing your Source is a very time-consuming process, so I found myself almost never using Source spells in combat.  This ties in with my assessment of the final fight, which is very hard and where you almost need to use Source (which you suddenly have limitless access to) to win - except that I had never really had a chance to experiment with that mechanic up to that point. I eventually managed to beat it, mostly through sheer luck, but it does not make for a very satisfying resolution to an otherwise great game.   All in all, despite the aforementioned flaws, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a huge improvement over the first game, which was already quite good. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is even the slightest bit interested in RPGs."
Zion_Shall-Fall,51,1,0,"November 2, 2017",Recommended,113.5,"I followed every stage of development. Larian Studios ran a transparent and honest Kickstarter campaign - they are such amazing developers. Others should learn from them.  Great game, what an rpg should be. There is so much content here it puts all triple A games to shame - this coulda been a 60usd/eur game and you would still be getting your moneys worth.   Game will really challenge you, even on normal...so it's not for crybabies. But it is a very gratifying, rich experience with plenty of humour, plots&twists and of course - awesome combat.  Definetly on of the best rpgs ever, certainly the best of its kind.  Get it. It's a no brainer."
DarthGrignr,154,1,0,March 1,Recommended,138.9,I bought this game on a whim because I saw that I could finally be a skeleton in an RPG.  What I got was so much more than that.  I've only worked through the first part (I think?) and have been throughly blown away.  The amount of player agency is amazing and nearly unheard of in modern games.  Larian used their Kickstarter money well and I can't wait to see what else they can do.
Jule Damn,37,1,0,March 2,Recommended,44.3,"I played part the Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition and enjoyed that, so I decided to get DOS 2 after I saw it on sale for a modest 10% (also because my friends had the game and I wanted to play with them).   As it turns out, this game is such an improvement on the first game that I just cant go back to DOSEE. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an amazing game that quite literally builds on every positive element of the Enhanced Edition and makes the game so much smoother and comprehensive.   YOU CAN NOW ACCESS ALL INVENTORIES OF YOUR PARTY MEMBERS IN ONE WINDOW. PRAISE LARIAN STUDIOS. Improvements were also made to many mechanics such as: Crafting, purchasing/bartering, targeting AOE spells.  The storyline is also so much more rich now that you have 5 preset characters to choose from (and the option to create your own). Right off the bat, I was much more engaged in DOS2's story than I ever was in the EE. I love their banter. I love that ALL party members can engage in dialogue, thus giving you multiple opportunities to get the ""right"" answers without needing to reload the game. The voice acting is great and the characters have personalities true to their plights.   If you enjoy story-rich games, this one's for you! (If the turn-based combat system deters you, there is the option to play the game in Explorer Mode to make the combat easier and thus a secondary feature).  TL;DR: This game is lots of fun! Kudos to a development team that listens to its community in order to improve on previous iterations of its game(s)!"
Oreo,346,1,0,March 10,Recommended,177.0,"The absolute best RPG I have played in a loooooong♥♥♥♥♥time. Amazing story content (voice acting, narration, etc.), fun and never dull combat system, one of the best co-op RPGs out there, I mean honestly, I am sad I finished the game, it was that good. I wanted to experience more, see more, do more, accidentally lightning strike my friends more, so much more! We played on Normal difficulty and it took us abut, 80-90 hours to complete. Such a great game, with very few bugs. I am in love with the developers, to make such a game and charge such a modest price for it. Bravo! I will tell you right now, if I see an added DLC for more story content, to continue on from where you leave off at the end, I will pay the price. Please I beg of you Larian Studios, make more story content, playable races (i.e. the Orc and Imp would be fun), add more zones, I would gladly support you! I highly recommend this to any one looking for a great solo adventure, or it is even better with a few friends! Keep up the great work guys!"
ishKiia,247,1,0,"October 22, 2017",Recommended,80.6,"Honestly I can't say enough about this game.  I was leery after enjoying the first one so much because so often the sequals are let-downs.  I haven't finished it yet and i'm not even half way through.    I love taking my time finding everything and most of my hours are just on the first island and I still left so many things undone!  The more I thought I completed the more I realized I had not completed.   That is good replayability!  The multiplayer is also so very much better than the previous one due to the interface Improvement changes with inventory, how things are done, etc.   I really can't find a downfall to the game...

Larian is possibly one of the  best companies, they're clairvoyant, they just know what we want.  What I Personally Love About The Game  The game is HARD, but only as hard as you make it for yourself     The game has a much darker tone than the first game     It keeps it's original charm from the first game, having a crab belittle you for having a collar (only if you have pet pal)     Co Op only makes the game even more enjoyable     The whole narritive of the story (for Act 1) just kind of throws you in there, a prisoner trying to escape the horrors of what's to come     This game has a lot of customization, not with just the looks but the whole class classless system.

Ark,353,1,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,133.8,"Words cannot fully describe how wonderful the game is. After 106 hours I have finally finished it on tactician difficulty - the second highest out of 4 difficulty levels - and it's been one hell of a ride. In the pool of games that have filled the cRPG genre over time some are remembered for the gems that they are. This game truly deserves a place among those stars.    Short and quick: The best aspects The combat offers a huge variety of possibilites. 200+ spells allow you to build your character exactly to your liking. They aren't all magical, they don't all scale with intelligence like you'd expect from classical RPGs meaning you can mix a lot of combinations on your character. Don't think of spells as a 'magician only' thing. Every character will use a wide variety and it feels amazing to have this much choice in battle.  The AI will use insane combinations and synergies of spells just as much as you do. They will sacrifice their own if it gives them an advantage, they will use the environment against you.   No ridiculous RNG: Although dicerolls aren't completely banished out of the game these mechanics never feel unfair like in some other RPGs. Games based on pen & paper tend to use a lot of dicerolls but here you'll find that most mechanics have been modified to be very clear about how they work without relying on RNG. Doesn't mean critical attacks aren't possible if you want to play that way ;-)  There are no classes. Don't get mistaken by the character creation, it's only meant to be a help for the early game. You level and can spent your points on the different schools of sorcery. You're never restricted because of a 'class' and after leaving the first area you can fully respecc at any time. You can truly built your character the way you want to.  The worldbuilding is amazing. There is so much to explore, so many NPCs to talk to and stories to experience.  The characters - from simple animals to essential NPCs - are just as amazingly written as the world. Some you'll love, some you'll laugh about, some you'll hate, but never will you think they are acting out of character.   The choice is always yours. One moment you're a saint, next moment you decide an NPC isn't worth keeping alive. Although sometimes limited, there are always consequences.   To further strengthen the last point: You can play the game anyway you want and never hit a roadblock in the story. Even if you murder every NPC you see you'll be able to finish the story.   Play the entire campaign with up to 4 players. 'nuff said  The voiceacting is phenomenal. Everything in this game is voiced, including the narrator. Not only that, but the variety in voices is so large you will rarely - if ever - notice two voices sounding alike. Every unimportant guard, every NPC without a name, every animal in the wild, every character - no matter how essential they are to the story - sounds different and they manage to bring the emotions their words carry to life.  The soundtrack manages to describe the atmosphere in a wonderful way.   Although the story is rather serious, the little sprinkles of humor every now and then shine brightly.  Short and quick: The worst aspects The companions sidequests are wonderful and they influence the main story quite a lot. But everywhere else they're a little pale as they rarely voice their oppinion on what you do during the rest of the journey.   This game can easily overwhelm you. If you're familiar with the cRPG gerne you'd expect this but everyone else be warned: This is not a game you finish in a couple of hours nor is it a linear game. Having a huge freedom means your questlog will burst at times.  The difficulty is real. Even on classic - the normal mode - you'll get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you on a silver plater. I finished the game in 106 hours on tactician - one difficulty above classic - and my save game told me I was 'alive' for 80 hours. That means I had 26 hours of reloading because of party wipes or decisions that I regreted. I thoroughly enjoyed the difficulty but be warned: It's not to be taken lightly.   A slight negative about undeads: If you play one or have one in your party you can chose to hide your undeadness and the story will acknowledge this but the combat won't. I assume it's done for the sake of difficulty and interesting gameplay, but enemies will always know that you're an undead and chose tactics that work against undeads like e.g. hurting you with healing magic.  After all is said, it's still a cRPG. There's a lot to read, a lot of sidequests to do and a lot of possibilites in how you tailor the story around you. Don't go into this game with wrong expectations. It's huge. Having wrong expectations can easily ruin the experience for you.  You might wonder even with all the high praise you've heard about this game how it compares to the best of the cRPG genre. It's not simple to answer this as classics like Baldur's Gate can be hard to enjoy these days. Some of the most defining games of this genre came out in the late 90's to early 00's after all. Divinity: Original Sin 2 takes the things that made those classics wonderful and wraps them into a modern engine. It learned from all the mistakes that happened with the first 'Original Sin' game and improved greatly on them. So in summary, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. For me it's not only the RPG of the year, it's a strong contender for game of the year."

So far I prefer the Origin characters cause you're getting more story mode for yourself, instead of just your companions. Speaking of which, the characters have great build, personality and of course, story. Ingredients needed for one to be attatched to a character of your choosing, mine for example being The Red Prince.  Allow me to share a funny tale while I am here...  So I'm in a full party and we decide to pick pocket this guy, but our rogue needs us to distract the guards.  So I pick mine and I end up getting into a romantic relationship at the very moment with this human thug named Butter.

Huge ammount of character customization and reactivity to choices you make it the game with an ending that morphs to your actions.

Stand-out qualities are the combat system, which is extremely fun and challenging, and the character customization since there is ten different school of abilities you can mix and match and dabble in so no two characters you play will ever be that similar. Try out a rogue/shapeshifter who dabbles in necromancy and pyromancy, the warrior/geomancer with a side dish of shapeshifting, or why not the summoner/necromancer with a touch of wind and water magic utility? The possibilities really are endless here, and in the best way possible.  Add to that a very well-crafted and immersive fantasy setting, important and interesting companion characters, fantastic music and you have one of the best games published in a long time."

I am not the biggest turn-based RPG fan, but Divinity: Original Sin II was recommended to me by a friend, and I am extremely glad I purchased it. 100+ hours for a first full playthrough, and I'm already considering my next.  The game itself is hard. VERY hard for a casual or novice player. This is the first game I have not felt that saving frequently amounted to save scumming. The fights are disgustingly hard when you first start out, BUT once you get a feel for the combat system and learn how to work the mechanics in your favor, it balances out quite nicely. The mechanics themselves are fantastic, and had me feeling great when I conquered battles that felt unfair and unbalanced.  That being said, avoid this game like the plague if you have no patience and want a game you can steamroll from the start. You will die, a lot, if you are inexperienced.   The storyline itself will suck you in and swallow your soul. I enjoyed it from beginning to the last sequence. That last sequence... sucked. Horribly. The battle, the story, the NPCs, everything. It was terrible. I wish the game hadn't ended because I loved it so much, to end up with that was just disheartening. There is a lot of choice in the game, and it gets ful marks from me for that. You can do anything you want, how you want, and with whoever you want. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Except for that final part, but endings don't make or break a game for me. It's the journey that matters.  Scores:  Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 9.5/10 (Ending gets a 3/10) Music: 7/10 (It was okay, nothing spectacular)  I'd have to give the game an overall 9.8/10 though. Even with my distaste for the ending sequence, this game is superb and deserves both your hard earned money and all the praise you can heap on it."
Vortigern,69,1,0,March 26,Recommended,120.9,"I always feel very lazy about writing reviews but they deserve it, even if the review is a little bit too late.   A title? A MASTERPIECE. After 117 hours in this game I finally finished it on normal mode. I did my best to explore every corner and solve every puzzle, read every book, but I ended up missing a few things.  I gotta play it again on a higher difficulty with other characters, specially with Loshe on the team.   Well, let's get to it. First of all you need to know if this game is for you. Do you like turn-based RPGs? Do you like reading the books that you find, caring about little details of the world and developing your characters regarding the lore? Do you like spending time outside the combat and just strolling around the city and getting to know its inhabbitants and its atmosphere? Then this game is definetely for you.   Why did I ask that? Well, the combat is amazing but you won't be battling every time. A lot of situations can be solved through dialogue for instance. That are a lot of other elements in the game like talking, exploration and puzzles. So you need to beware of that.  The story starts slow and you have a feeling that you won't care for it at all. But you need to see how things develop. It has ups and downs and a complexity that I can't explain to you without spoiling it. I loved it. You will care for most characters and even sidekicks, damn, it is that good. There are a lot of humor and jokes in the game, like talking to silly or arrogant animals or facing ironical situations. It doesn't diminish the experience or transform it into a goofish playthrough. No. It adds up, a lot. You feel that you are in a rich and complex world with characters that mess up, that are understandable badguys or that are just self righteous♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥    Regarding the combat system, it had a lot of improvments in comparison to the previous title. Fire, Water, Electricity, Poison, Oil, Clouds, Blood, High Ground (Yes, I have it, Anakin), Low Ground, Teleportation, Physical Armor, Magical Armor, Resistances, etc. are all things to take into account, contributing to enhance the complexity of the combat system. The enemies will try to use those elements against you and the AI is pretty decent most of the time.  However, I have to say that there are minor issues regarding battles. What annoys me the most? Fights with 5+ enemies that cast 2-3 spells each. Man, that can take a lot of your time. Dead time because you will just be watching them casting and casting. It can take forever. Also, it pisses me off when the enemy uses a spell that takes control you character - like ""charm"" for exemple. In those occasions the AI simply doesn't know what to do. It takes a longer time to calculate the action and will eventually drink all your potions for nothing, while you sit there waiting.   In addition to that there are some minor bugs regarding the quest log. And I feel that they could really improve the inventory system. It's better and Divinity Origial Sin 1,sure, but it can still get pretty messy, specially books. My suggestion? Make it like a library system in your headquarters. Then you could store them in a shelf to complete a specific collection, let's say alchemy recipes or Hewbert's Encyclopedia. Also, the crafting system could be better too. I know that they want it to be more based on intuition, but some times the player has no clue about the ingredients. Also, more meaningful crafted armors and weapons would be awesome.   Nevertheless, all of those are minor criticism to improve the game. It's absolutely gorgeous - visually and musically -, engaging and a true RPG experience. I feel that those AAA companies really have a lot to learn from Larian Studios. I liked Divinity Original Sin 1, but the sequel is absolutely amazing. Bravo!  "
FamishedPants,237,1,0,January 25,Recommended,111.7,"I should mention that 99% of my playtime is in the starting area, restarting because my friends and I can't just choose a class we want and stick with it. And even that 1% is only like five minutes of playtime after you leave tutorial island.   This game is still great, however. There's so much to do, so many things to discover, and the combat is great, even if I find myself on fire for the majority of any given battle. Do give this game a shot if you want Dungeons and Dragons in video game form, as it's the closest thing to it that you can possibly get."

SB | WriterV,133,1,1,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,55.6,"Possibly one of the most brilliant RPGs I have played in all time. I was, unfortunately, born too late to see Baldur's Gate 2 in all its glory when it first released, and by the time I did play the game, it had already felt extremely dated, and even still held a certain magic to its world.  Even though DOS:2 does not hold that same kind of magic, it has its own special moments while feeling like a modern game. The world has absorbed me, the characters have enraptured me and I think on an overall, this is one of the few games in which your choices actually matter.  Plus the price isn't your traditonal 60$, while still feeling like a bigger game than most 60$ games these days.  So yeah, if you're into RPGs, wonderful worlds and fun characters... Buy it."

frozen north,40,1,0,"December 8, 2017",Recommended,113.4,"Holy crap. This game is amazing.  So heres the run down. This game is in effect a massive game of dungeons and dragons, only the game is the dungeon master rather then your friend being the dungeon master.   The RPG aspects all feel really nicely done here, with concious effort being required to decide on how best to talk your way through a situation. The fact that every character in the game comes with voice acting is simply astounding, esspecially given just how many characters there are in this game.  As far as combat is concerned, its very similar to XCOM and atlas reactor. Each character recieves a turn, with the order being determind by each characters initiave stat. Much like XCOM and atlas reactor, every action has to have its strength and weaknesses weighted against the situation. To be completely honest, the combat system feels so smooth and effective, it makes the non-combat sections feel underwhelming as a result, and believe me, they definetly are not boring.  The multiplayer aspects are really nice. Personally, I recommend only playing multiplayer with friends, but that has more to do with ensuring cooperation then anything else. One nice feature of playing with friends is that it makes every moment feel more enjoyable.  All that said, I do have a few nitpicks about this game. The ingame market system can feel annoying at times, since only one person can foot the bill for an order of gear. Similarly, there will be many occasions where you can find yourself running through the same dialog again and again in hopes of achieving the best result.  However, despite everything else I have said, the single best thing about this game is its customizability. Built into the game is an editor that allows you to alter the map, the story, and where all enemies are located, which gives the game huge replay value. On top of that, the game is perfectly capable of accepting mods, which cranks this games replay value up to eleven.  Summary: Pros: + Absolutely amazing combat system that feels very familiar to anyone who has played XCOM. + Amazing graphics quality. + Insanely rich story and lore. + Dozens of hours per campaign. + Tons of replay value. + All voice acting is well done, and if you can talk to it, it has a voice. + Loot has a heavy ammount of RNG attached to it. + Everything is right there after you download the game (an increasingly rare thing these days). + Your starting class is completely flexible, and you can change just about everything about your starting class. + You do not need to stick to a specific class as the game goes on, allowing you to adapt as you go. + A ton of workshop content, and the games less then four months old.  Cons: - Things can get a little tedious at times, particularly if your not the best at keeping your saves up to date. - Purchasing from vendors is a little annoying, and I personally feel it could stand some more quality of life features. - You may find yourself restarting fights often as you realize what actually is happening.  Conclusions: Divinity original sin 2 is simply an amazing game. Almost everything about this game screams of quality, and feels like it is the result of honest game design. When people say this is a top of the line RPG game, they are not kidding. With extreme ease of modding, and a still growing community, its easy to see why this game is being called game of the year material.  Score: 9.9/10"

abel1717,82,1,0,March 26,Recommended,147.2,"""Original Sin 2"" is an excellent game with a horrible balance of forces.  It has all the elements to be a rewarding game with satisfying game playability (i.e., you can play it in so many different ways you never get bored). However, when fighting multiple foes it gets disturbing that the player must wait ages until every one of them took a shot at your character. I think it must be better if not all the enemy players attack in a single turn."

JOOHN CENAA,42,1,0,May 17,Recommended,128.8,"Great game overall.  Pros: + Complex, detailed and engaging story in an immersive fictional world + Finished the game with ~130 hours clocked from one playthrough, and I didn't complete all of the quests + High quality of voice acting throughout, dialogue options vary between characters + Combat system incredibly versatile with a huge range of possibilites and combinations + Skills and equipment can allow a high level of specialisation for certain characters, with a huge variety of abilities + Similarly, the levelling up system allows for lots of modifications, and later in the game it is possible to re-spec characters if you made poor choices early on + A high level of customatisation, good voice acting, and in depth character backstories all lends the characters credibility in a way that can make you love or hate them + Extremely varied quest lines, often there are multiple ways to solve each quest + Really laugh-out-loud funny at times  Cons: - Steep learning curve on the combat, very much thrown in at the deep end with little explanation of complex system  - The combat is actually pretty hard throughout, and more casual gamers might find the repeated loading frustrating, as a small slip up in combat can be pretty unforgiving - Similarly, the game has a bad habit of insta-killing you with no real way of predicting it (e.g. suddenly encountering over-levelled enemies, environmental hazards, or the enemy has some ability/skill that you had no way of countering until now) - Quests can sometimes be tortuous in a way that means I would never have worked out on my own e.g. a riddle once asked for fire, but this didn't work, and I found online that I had to generate a fire cloud instead (?!) which I had never come across before and could only reliably find by buying one particular spellbook from one particular unrelated vendor. I spent a lot of time looking up how I was supposed to do quests - Similarly, quests can have unexpected consequences that can be inconvenient later on and lead to missing out on future quests - As I said before, you may find yourself totally underlevelled in an unexpected battle, and this does somewhat detract from the whole open world RPG vibe in that you have no hope of defeating some of the higher levelled enemies and have to go find some lower level enemies first, effectively forcing you to follow a pre-set path eliminating the weak enemies first and then going back for the higher ones. It makes the game feel more linear, although it is satisfying to decimate the enemies who destroyed you a couple of levels ago   Overall the negative points don't massively detract from the game and it is a compelling and immersive game from start to finish with complex but satisfying combat. More importantly, you can talk to dogs!! "

I love this game."
Literal Potato,227,1,0,May 30,Recommended,87.1,"TL;DR: Extremely well designed RPG overall, Great visual/graphics, Engaging and well written story, deep, fun, and challenging gameplay, would totally recommend this game if you are a fan of the genre  Aesthetics (Graphics, Visuals, Music): Absolutely top notch- the amount of detail in this game is astounding on a visual level. From each character looking fantastic, to the detail in spells and animation, to the level of beauty in the environment, overall this game looks great. The only drawback to this is that it's more demanding, resource-wise, than similar games. The music is also phenomenal and really follows the mood of the story without being too intrusive.  Gameplay: the combat system in this game is pretty similar to other CRPGs, but goes above and beyond. My personal favorite touch is the amount with which the environment can contribute to combat scenarios. There is a small learning curve which basically makes it the Dark Souls of- just kidding. There is a weird issue with balance where being overleveled by just 1 or 2 levels makes some fights trivial while being underleveled by 1 or 2 levels makes some fights annoyingly difficult, but overall, the game seems to do a good job of leveling the playing field... unless you're like me and added a mod that doubles the amount of enemies. One thing that is really underappreciated is how civil abilities affect gameplay. Characters have to balance environment and gear interactions, stealth skills, luck, and persuasion/bartering all in one pool of points. This can lead to balanced jack of all trades (master of none) characters, or min-max characters. This game also allows a lot of freedom in how to play by deciding lone wolf or travelling with a full party and by allowing you to constantly respec yourself and your companions.  Story: Extremely deep and interesting. I have found myself underwelmed by  lot of RPG stories as of late, thut this game was definitely an exception. Each of the comanions/prebuilt characers have their own stories which are fairly interesting but the main story and most of the side quests are captivating. There seems to be just enough instruction that you have an idea what to do, but this game will definitely not hold your hand and tell you exatly where to go. You can get lost or have absolutely no idea where to go, but it doesn't take a lot to get you back on track. Decently replayable - story length can be 30-70 hours depending on how into the story and side quests you get.  Notes: I haven't tried the multiplayer or GM mode yet"
Imperius,72,1,0,May 30,Recommended,107.3,"Didnt know i could like a turn based game so much. Never played FF so this was a great first game to try in the genre. Basically a D&D campaign in video game form. My preference in games is that there is an rpg element and this one satisfied that need. Fun to play with friends albeit it very slow. Replay value is low if you play on the hardest difficulty first and some of the skills for solo make the game very easy. Still very fun, by on sale."
Autumn,113,1,0,May 30,Recommended,74.0,This is probably one of the greatest RPG ever made. Turn based combat with a huge variety of builds allows for very imaginative playthroughs combat-wise.

Funnychocobo13,49,1,0,June 26,Recommended,130.4,"I. Adore. This. Game.  This is one of the only RPGs I've played in recent history in which I rarely felt like I couldn't do or say exactly what I wanted in any given moment. Quests can be tranversed, subversed, or just flat-out ignored. There are multiple means to achieving your goals. In short, player freedom is abundant throughout. Pacing of the game is great at best, decent at worst. The Origin characters, and, thus, your companions, fit your pretty typical Fantasy archetypes (gruff lone wolf mercenary, snobby exiled prince, raunchy pirate dwarf), but they never feel too wholly unoriginal. In fact, by the end I grew to like my little cast of mildly predictable misfits. Their individual quests also provide some extra motivation to continue, helping along with the general pace of things. Combat is fun, clever, and rewarding to master. Few things feel as good as properly changing up the terrain with a few spells or broken barrels then using the newly doused ground to trail a lightning spell to your enemies. The combat balance in the game isn't always perfect, but it is good enough throughout most of it that the few unfairly difficult fights don't overshadow the challenging but fun ones. There's not much to say about the music in the game. It's magnificent, I love it, and I order the soundtrack on vinyl. So there. I haven't even dabbled in the Game Master mode or the various Workshop mods yet, but they look very promising and exciting. At the time of writing (June 2018), I have 128 hours or so played in the game. That was one playthrough and maybe 5 hours of my second. I am not at all concerned that this game was not worth the investment. On top of that, Larian (the developer) is still supporting the game, working hard on the Definitive Edition of the game due out later this year (free of charge for players who already own the game). They clearly love their game, and it's apparent through all the work they do. So not only would you be getting a great game, but you'd be supporting a wonderful studio in the process.

I love that there is freedom to do whatever you want without it being sub-optimal, thanks to armor requirements being awesomely forgiving and skill scaling being on level or weapon.

Fred FredBurger,355,1,0,May 28,Recommended,48.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is OKAY at BEST. I wholeheartedly agree with some of the more critical reviews.  The first chapter of Fort Joy is the highlight of the game and after that it starts turning mediocre at times.  I tend to be a completionist. I was level 7 on all of my characters escaping Fort Joy and the game became tedious and boring to me in the swamp area.  At some point in the game you will realize that your choices really do not matter and that out of 4 dialogue options, you really only have 2 that are different. I cannot find myself to beat this game even after leaving the swamp area.  It sucks at times.  It's so boring watching the combat and the fights now are all the same crap. Even on normal difficulty the balance between easy fights and difficult feels off.  I shouldn't have left Fort Joy at level 7 (average is around level 5 i believe) but that's what the game allowed and I suffered for it. I don't feel divine. I don't feel powerful. I feel like I am doing chores running around and watching boring♥♥♥♥♥fight scenes and I'm not alone.  To add to this if you just wanted to rush through the story you would be underleveled and then have an extremely difficult time all the time.  This game needs dynamic balancing badly.  My friends all bought this game and we don't play multiplayer anymore. I am the only one who got past 40 hours of playtime and I regret it. 5/7 would game again."

Thank you Larian For making this gem."
lowly barista [zani],300,1,0,June 5,Recommended,73.4,"Much bigger than the first game.  Combat evolved a lot.   I don't know if it's better or worse, it depends on how you feel about co-op or single player campaigns.   It nerfed a lot of interactions you could use in the first and it also added semi-permanent battle field states.  The plus side is that the story has so many branching points that it's difficult to say if you're playing storyline 1 2 or 3.  I wouldn't call it seamless but I'd say its far less jarring than playing KOTR or something similar.  I highly recommend playing thsi blind as well.  Bring a friend or go alone;  don't expect to see everything this game has to offer unless you have gobs of time."

Roche,165,1,0,"December 3, 2017",Recommended,179.1,"A Must Buy RPG Summary:  This is the best classic-rpg I've ever played and most polished indie game. It's the first example, in a long time, of a game that made me feel like paying full price was more than worth it. My reasons and dislikes are bulleted as pros & cons. If you're hesitant, try learning about the franchise before playing. The world is interesting without prior knowledge of the Divinity franchise, but I still highly recommend you catch up on the lore. At the very least the first original sin game if not all of it. If not, make sure to read the store page and view the trailers before starting. Otherwise, your introduction into the franchise backstory (universe) will be journal entries and books. There is pvp in the game, but it's far from being a highlight. It's practically dead; you'd have more luck co-oping.  Rating: Solid 9/10 Pros:  - Rich Backstory - Multiple approaches to questlines - Best looking classic isometric rpg so far - Abundance and variety of skills and abilities - Well over 100 hours worth of good content - Your character can become any class combination in the game - Great co-op, able to compete with teamates or help each other - Good writing, mostly voice acted, solves a common weakness in the genre - Both side and main quests are engaging, laced with secrets and hidden areas  - Old school, sandbox-like, lack of handholding, more freedom as a result:    o The easy mode doesn't neccessarily simplify the game, just the combat  - High replayability in both custom and original chars:    o Race influences how you're percieved and affects dialogue and quest approach    o Multiple endings based on key decisions  - Decent modding community, solves several minor complaints (disables achivements):    o Visuals like clothing, hair, face model, more loot indicators etc.    o Progression (xp tweaks, starting gear)    o Abilities reworked for the better    o Buff effects, durations etc.    o User-made campaigns Cons:  - Companions don't say much - Few questline bugs, still rewards exp - The 4 acts in the game are great, but the last one is rushed - Combat favors heavy specialization in harder difficulties (all melee, all magic) - Crafting and inventory management is a pain, adds unnecessary time (no search function)"

Ageless Avatar,60,1,1,January 25,Recommended,339.5,"If you are looking at reviews for this game, I am going to assume some things; Those things being that you might not know anything about Divinity games but that you like RPGS. So I will make this very simple: Stop reading and buy this game. Right now.  What, you're not going to listen to me? Still reading? A stubborn audience . . . I like that. Fine, let me attack you with some of the better reasons to immediately get this game.   -4 Player Co-op or Play solo with 4 characters to aid you!  -Rewarding and hilariously fun isometric-turn-based combat with a slew of fun mechanics. Think Baulder's Gate meets Xcom. You can make it rain followed by dropping lighting on everything thats wet, or set the enemy ablaze by dousing them with oil and chucking a bit of fire their way.   -A rich world full of mistakes to make and trouble to find. What? That sounds bad? That's like 90% OF 90% of all RPG titles! Seriously though talk to that crab, rob that old woman,♥♥♥♥♥♥of that dragon. You can do it, I have total faith in you!  -A rewarding and hilariously fun choose-your-style combat. Make your own class! Want a Knight that shoots lighting? A greatsword wielding Mage? Go the heckens for it!  -A marvelous cast of characters. The Origins characters and the NPC's of the worlds are just great.  -An engaging and expansive story. Saying nothing, go play this game.   -Adorable Talking Animals. They are the best.   -Rewarding and hil- I think you get that point by now actually: It's fun to fight all the things!  -A GM mode so you can make your own D&D like story for your own vict- friends to play!  There is a ton more but honestly I have to get back to playing this thing. Get this game my dude."

Jackrabbitofdoom,140,1,0,"December 3, 2017",Recommended,55.7,"It's a lot of fun even if you're new to RPGs in general.  Combat - Simple, VERY open system in which you can attack anybody at any time. (Good for setting up fights with neutral characters you don't like or friendly characters that have good loot.)   Dialogue/Story - The dynamic between the templar-esque people and the summoners is fun. Skills such as the one that makes you able to talk to animals serves as a way of having a unique experience that most people wouldn't pick. Though I have to say, some of the mid/later game story is pretty boring and I skipped through most of it.   Graphics - Game looks good as♥♥♥♥♥♥ I really enjoy the elemental damage appearance. Ex. Pouring rain on an area then hitting it when lightning.   Control - It's mostly point and click for everything. There are some pretty nice things in the game though, like the ability to detach certain members from the main party.   Replayability - I have yet to play half of the classes and two of the races in the game.   Overall - 9/10. Besides the story that begins to drag a bit near the mid/end game, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of fun."

E.T,271,1,0,January 20,Recommended,89.9,"Joins and surpasses Baulders gate, Fallout 2 and planescape Torment as one of the best isometric Rpg Games of all time.  Divinity: Original sin 2 takes the classic isometric Rpg improves it with combined spell effects a unique world and several quirks to diffrence it from the classics a most have for anyone enjoying RPG.  Recommend playing with friends, a party of 4 with your friends is awesome. but the game is super fun playing alone as well.  + Beautiful aesthetics.  + Excellent sound design.  + a unquie and intresting system for combat effects (watch one of the videos explaining the spell casting system and you     will see for your self).  + Challenging Enter an area before you are ready and the journey can be a bit rough.  The (slightly) Bad.  - Theiving system is a bit to powerful have a theif and you can basiclly steal your way through the game and get powerfull     gear and skill books that you wouldnt otherwise afford.  - sensitive controls, the combant controls can be a bit sensitive have happened a couple of times my characthers have walked instead of attacked.

Khalamity of the Hums,96,1,0,"December 24, 2017",Recommended,116.8,I had a blast playing this with friends and it's one of the best multiplayer D&D-esque games on the market. There is a lot of content. You won't burn through this game's story in 20-30 hours like most rpg's.
EnthusiasticTaco,43,1,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,35.3,"This game starts very strong but has the common inconsistencies of RPG, Free dialogue style play. (Similar to Fallout, Elder scrolls). I have spent almost 40 hours in the game to date and have enjoyed it, however, I never feel this game draws you into the world. It doesn't deserve 9/10 ratings, it is 7/10 at best. There are some game breaking mechanics that weaken a class or particular set of abilities.  Teleport is overwhelmingly overpowered, it literally breaks every aspect of the game if you use it right. You can completely alter the desired mechanic of a fight by using it. (unfairly) For example, Whilst a boss, I teleported him to my party and immediately killed him alone, well before his allies could help him and then when a neutral add spawned, i teleported his party members to the neutral add to get cleaved and then had to just fight the neutral add.   For example, Having a mage/wizard doing damage in a party primarily built up of Physical dps (Enemies have two forms of Armour, Physical and Magical) is pointless.  Their value as damage dealers drops to zero, they will hardly break-through any magical armour alone.  ""Tank"" classes don't exist as taunt has too short of a range, and most times your enemies will be immune to taunt.  I enjoyed the game, but simple things like save files and fast travels legitamtely break any immersion. You can save game in the middle of a fight and alter it to achieve victory at certain points. In one quest chain, your party is separated intentionally for the purpose of the quest. However, you can just fast travel to the centre of the quest zone with each individual character, there-by eliminating any effort.  The good;  Voice acting is incredible, if you enjoy DnD, then you'll love this game. Classical mode seems like the perfect ""Normal"" - It is challenging/formidable if you brazenly walk into a room of enemies, but if you draw them through fire or into a choke point then it becomes an even playing field.  LoS is your friend.  Probably the best turn based strategy game i've played to date.  Sneak and Thievery is just plain OP, you can't go without it.  Being able to sneak and put explosive barrels around enemies is vital to success in many fights, especially against stronger mobs.    Buy the game and make an opinion yourself. I stopped enjoying it at close to 40 hours played. The story was boring and uninteresting and even at 40 hours (Which is half way through the game).  Still worth a pick up - but the game really comes down to personal taste, it doesn't appeal to me.  i would love to see more games with this classical mode difficulty, by far that was the most interesting aspect of the game."

CptRagebeard,104,1,0,April 20,Recommended,112.1,"This game is, by far, the best RPG game I have ever played in the history of all my 20 years of gaming. I cannot wait to put thousands of hours into it. The only issue I have with it, however, is how limited the character creation system is, but I guess no game can be absolutely perfect. That said, here's why I love this game and will enjoy playing it for likely years to come.  The story:  I've only ever gotten so far as ACT II, but even still, the story in that time is so rich it'd put the CEO of the Amazon corporation to shame. The openess of the story makes for excellent roleplay elements. It'll keep you hooked and wanting more and more the further you delve into it.  Gameplay:  The only class restrictions are literally how you choose to build your character because of where you choose to put your attribute and ability points. That sky's the limit, and any kind of character imaginable can be built and played in this game. I would even go so far as to say this game is the closest game to a D&D simulator there can be without actually being D&D.  Combat:  Generally, I'm not a fan of turn-based combat outside of games like CIV games, but the system for this game really takes the cake. While the combat is turned based, the way it's set up to function is absolutely marvelous. The great minds at Larian Studios definitely didn't go wrong with it--at all.  Customization:  This game is open to steam workshop elements and modding. It also has a Dungeon Master aspect that allows you to create and run custom campaigns for you and four of your friends. However, I recommend playing the game as the vanilla version before adding mods to it, as some of them can be quite game breaking. Trust me, though, you absolutely won't regret it.  All-in-all, this game is pretty much perfect minus my only aforementioned problem with character customization. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this game and have absolutely nothing but good things to say about it! I give this game a 9.9/10."

It might even surpass my love for fallout 1. In a few days, Divinity original sin 2, became my most played game on steam.  The main storyline is somewhat generic, but almost all of the side-quests are amazing, with most of them having multiple outcomes.  When i began, i wasn't sure how i felt about the pre-generated characters (even though you can make your own too) but having played through the game, both alone and with friends, i actually love it. it gives the game quite alot of replayability, because the game feels more chracters driven, than most CRPG's do.  The turn-based combat system feels amazing to me. I've read complaints about the armor system. But i like it, because you can't just stun-lock every enemy. You have to be more tactical than that. exspecially on the harder difficulties.  It has some bugs, but larian seems to be doing what they can to fix them.   overall the graphics might be a little outdated, but it has alot of charm, and some nice spell effects."

I'm in to RPGs like Skyrim, the Witcher, Dragon Age(ish), and fantasy stuff like that. I had always seen this game advertised on steam's front page in recommended for me, but i never took it seriously since it gave me a very ""Diablo 3"" kinda vibe, and that felt too grindy and un-fun for me. But eventually, I finally caved a decided to take a good look at it and felt i should try it out, since I've heard pretty much only good things (see entire review section of this game lmao). Basically, i didn't many expectations starting out.  Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game is good. Like really good. Like REALLY, REALLY good. I did not expect to fall in love as much as I did, nor to ♥♥♥♥ing binge the game and end up earning 80 hours played within a week. I believe a testament to this game's quality is how hard i fell for it, even without playing (or even really knowing about) the first Divinity. It's detailed, it's fun, it has a great story, the gameplay is engaging and does not get dull, and the sheer freedom the player has is incredible. The game's dialouge and overall feel gives me a big DnD vibe. There are many, many branches a dialouge, quests, and the story itself can break off into which will seriously affect how you go forward in the game, even affecting the ending in a very critical way, not the ""good"" or ""bad"" ending bs you normally get from choice-based gameplay like Dishonored or Mass Effect. Moreso, the games gives you more freedom in how you want to build your character, not confining people to class, but rather providing a ""skill level"" you must be leveled up to in order to learn certain abilities, which are all fairly low.  I don't have the ability like other people to give you a long review about every little thing, so I'll leave with this: If you are looking for a fantasy RPG that will reward you with a in-depth experience and let you truly craft your character to be exactly who YOU want them to be, then this is the game for you.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a calibur of game that belongs with the other incredible RPGs like Skyrim or The Witcher 3, and possibly has the potential to surpass them, in my opinion. 11/10 ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic"

Just as a heads up.. late game gets really busy. Take note of the system requirements because there will be slow down with lower end CPUs.

Rabid Rabbit,50,1,0,September 26,Recommended,345.0,"This is honestly one of my favourite games of all time. The story, the charcter design, customisation options, the in-depth class building and mixing, the co-op opportunities; I could go on forever saying what this game does brilliantly and how amazing of an adventure you would find yourself on if you bought this game, but i doubt that steam would allow such a long review. simply put, this is one of the best (if not the best) RPGs out there. And like many RPGs, this game is very supportive of mods, which is something i would definitely recommend looking at if you wish to spice up the game [Note: Be aware that this will disable achievements]. The modding community is one of the best modding communities out there, opening up opportunities for new, crazy classes to choose from, increased enemy difficulty, more customisation options, different buffs and de-buffs for you, your allies and your enemies and so much more. what's more, every character has a voice, even your custom character! no more suffering from silent protangonist syndrome, your character all the freedom in the world to speak their opinions.   10/10 would recommend to anyone who like RPGs and is invested in a good story.

The characters are intriguing, the voice actors are stellar, the turn based combat is really nice for people who have a lot of interruptions in their lives or just like the chess-like strategy of combat.  I just wish it was longer.  By the time you really feel like you have your group fleshed out, you're done.  However, it does have replay value as you discover more and different builds to try out, and with the mods available, you really can come up with all kinds of party makeups."

I was, unfortunately, born too late to see Baldur's Gate 2 in all its glory when it first released, and by the time I did play the game, it had already felt extremely dated, and even still held a certain magic to its world.  Even though DOS:2 does not hold that same kind of magic, it has its own special moments while feeling like a modern game. The world has absorbed me, the characters have enraptured me and I think on an overall, this is one of the few games in which your choices actually matter.  Plus the price isn't your traditonal 60$, while still feeling like a bigger game than most 60$ games these days.  So yeah, if you're into RPGs, wonderful worlds and fun characters... Buy it."

frozen north,40,1,0,"December 8, 2017",Recommended,113.4,"Holy crap. This game is amazing.  So heres the run down. This game is in effect a massive game of dungeons and dragons, only the game is the dungeon master rather then your friend being the dungeon master.   The RPG aspects all feel really nicely done here, with concious effort being required to decide on how best to talk your way through a situation. The fact that every character in the game comes with voice acting is simply astounding, esspecially given just how many characters there are in this game.  As far as combat is concerned, its very similar to XCOM and atlas reactor. Each character recieves a turn, with the order being determind by each characters initiave stat. Much like XCOM and atlas reactor, every action has to have its strength and weaknesses weighted against the situation. To be completely honest, the combat system feels so smooth and effective, it makes the non-combat sections feel underwhelming as a result, and believe me, they definetly are not boring.  The multiplayer aspects are really nice. Personally, I recommend only playing multiplayer with friends, but that has more to do with ensuring cooperation then anything else. One nice feature of playing with friends is that it makes every moment feel more enjoyable.  All that said, I do have a few nitpicks about this game. The ingame market system can feel annoying at times, since only one person can foot the bill for an order of gear. Similarly, there will be many occasions where you can find yourself running through the same dialog again and again in hopes of achieving the best result.  However, despite everything else I have said, the single best thing about this game is its customizability. Built into the game is an editor that allows you to alter the map, the story, and where all enemies are located, which gives the game huge replay value. On top of that, the game is perfectly capable of accepting mods, which cranks this games replay value up to eleven.  Summary: Pros: + Absolutely amazing combat system that feels very familiar to anyone who has played XCOM. + Amazing graphics quality. + Insanely rich story and lore. + Dozens of hours per campaign. + Tons of replay value. + All voice acting is well done, and if you can talk to it, it has a voice. + Loot has a heavy ammount of RNG attached to it. + Everything is right there after you download the game (an increasingly rare thing these days). + Your starting class is completely flexible, and you can change just about everything about your starting class. + You do not need to stick to a specific class as the game goes on, allowing you to adapt as you go. + A ton of workshop content, and the games less then four months old.  Cons: - Things can get a little tedious at times, particularly if your not the best at keeping your saves up to date. - Purchasing from vendors is a little annoying, and I personally feel it could stand some more quality of life features. - You may find yourself restarting fights often as you realize what actually is happening.  Conclusions: Divinity original sin 2 is simply an amazing game. Almost everything about this game screams of quality, and feels like it is the result of honest game design. When people say this is a top of the line RPG game, they are not kidding. With extreme ease of modding, and a still growing community, its easy to see why this game is being called game of the year material.  Score: 9.9/10"

abel1717,82,1,0,March 26,Recommended,147.2,"""Original Sin 2"" is an excellent game with a horrible balance of forces.  It has all the elements to be a rewarding game with satisfying game playability (i.e., you can play it in so many different ways you never get bored). However, when fighting multiple foes it gets disturbing that the player must wait ages until every one of them took a shot at your character. I think it must be better if not all the enemy players attack in a single turn."

rinks361,141,1,0,"October 26, 2017",Recommended,56.0,"I absolutely loved the first Original Sin and this sequal is even better. It expands heavily on the tactical combat and player choice of the first game in ways that few to no other RPGs of it's kind has ever done. I'm several hours in and have only cleared the initial starting area and apparently there are still HOURS and HOURS of main quests, side quests and other diversions to go. The voice acting is great. The loot is great. The characters are in depth and amazing (even talking to animals you will find that they are highly unique and have diverse voice actors!). The replayability in this game is very high as well as you can always tackle quests and situations in NUMEROUS ways. This game is so far from linear it puts similar games to shame. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet but it would be fun to see how it compares to the first game."

Being able to talk to pets, YAY! Replay interest is really high as I am fascinated by the stories and how they play out.

With that said, a few points to make that may equally fall on the positive as landing on your con list. All of this is most true as long as you enter the game wanting to experience the story and invest in the characters. Otherwise I imagine some parts fall flat. Most of the systems (like crafting etc) aren't introduced and taught which could be frustrating with no limitation of what to pick up or not (bit of the Elder Scrolls syndrome)."
Mister Big Dragon Milk,185,1,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,44.9,"At the time of writing this review, I've put about 30ish hours into the game (I torrented the game at first, don't judge me), and honestly I love this game.  I'm a big fan of RPGs in general (check my hours on basically any of the Bethesda RPGs and The Witcher 2&3) as well as an avid D&D player.  This game to me feels like playing Dungeons and Dragons but focusing on all the delicious crunch of player creation, leveling, and building.  The system feels tight and well balanced as well as having a great variety of player options to choose from.  Players are not so much locked into a specific role or archetype in this game.  Your average tanky knight character isn't just a dude with a sword and a shield, more often than not he's dabbling in earth or water magic to shore up his own defenses, or perhaps it's a rogue dabbling in necromancy.  Your mage may be wearing full plate and running into the thick of things, firing off fireballs in all directions.  The point is, the game gives you a lot of options to build and grow your character.  I've yet to ""beat"" the game but I've enjoyed the crunch so much, I've made a good dozen or so characters just to try out different playstyles.  Most of the issues I've had with the core gameplay have been patched, (i.e certain boss monsters skipping my characters turn because they get a forced turn one even though my character had a higher initiative, spells and attack not registering while draining AP, and other misc. bugs and oversights).  The world of Divinity is also interesting.  Worldbuilding is something I like to do in my spare time and some of the ideas presented in this game are very very cool.  Lizards are former dragons and rulers of an empire built on the backs of slaves, elves are cannibals who gain knowledge from eating flesh, and dwarves are... well I guess they're standard fantasy dwarves but ♥♥♥♥ it, dwarves are cool.  The setting of the game does a few neat things to try and separate it from it's bog-standard fantasy and I definitely appreciate that.  The writing in general, outside of general worldbuilding, is pretty compelling too.  It feels like some companions got a bit more attention than others, but each one of them feels distinct with their own backgrounds, personalities, flaws, and goals.  Dialogue is consistently well written and companions arcs as they get deeper into their questlines is nice to watch and be a part of.  Inter-party drama between companions is interesting and a nice detail not a whole lot of RPGs care to put in.  My personal favorite companion is the Red Prince; he's such a lovable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and his voice actor is on spot.  Now onto the ""role playing"" itself.  A lot of people seem to have forgotten that RPGs as we know it were built upon the foundation of tabletop roleplaying games.  Y'know, games where you actually make a character and have to, to a certain extent, act out their personality and put yourself into their shoes.  Divinity lets you do that, at least to an extent that doesn't detract from the core of the game.  While I appreciate their attempts, and the writing does help make some of these roleplaying moments hit their mark, there's a disconnect between the game and it's attempt to let you roleplay.    Firstly; It's just straight up better to end almost all conflicts in the game by killing the bastard.  You gain no XP, or at least not comparable XP, for talking or slying your way out of a difficult situation when compared to just murdering the poor soul.  I understand it'd probably be a bit difficult to try and balance this out; someone passes their speech check and then murders them anyway, gaining double XP.  But there's a solution out there somewhere that is well balanced while still letting players roleplay their characters.  But as the game is right now, it's just better to murder hobo your way though most of the game.  Secondly; Persuasion mechanics are very weird and not very transparent as of now.  Usually some dialogue choices with have [Wits] or [Strength] next to them when trying to convince another character.  This gives the impression that this game is doing what Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 1 & 2 did; giving you special dialogue options just for being your character.  Your character shouldn't have to be a smooth talking son of a ♥♥♥♥♥ to talk themselves out of every situation.  A particularly strong character can bully someone into submission; a perceptive person can read their body language and make inferences as to that persons intentions or thoughts.  You have a character with 30 Strength who wants to intimidate someone, but then you fail.  What happened?  Did you put one too many points into Contitution?  No.  Persuasion mechanics are just poorly handled.  I'm not 100% sure how they work, but some pesuasion attempts are pointless.  They SEEM to key off an ability, but in fact they don't and are just guaranteed to fail.  Some persuasion checks do seem to work ala Fallout 1/2/NV, but most require at least one point in persuasion, if not more.  Not only are the Persuasion mechanics non-transparent (unlike almost all the other bits of crunch in the game), but the game seems to be almost misleading it's players into thinking that the mechanics work a different way, when they do not.  I think the way Fallout NV handled persuasion is probably the best way an RPG can handle it.   But for the most part, just ignore my tangent on the roleplaying aspects of the game.  The rest of the experience is fantastic.  This is easily the best RPG I have played since The Witcher 3 dropped two years ago.  This game might not be for all people, but I can confidently say that it tickled my pickle.  Pros: * It's pretty. * Soundtrack is sick * Deep and meaningful character creation and building * Consistently good writing and voice action throughout * The crunch is good * Doesn't hold your hand * At least 40 hours worth of content in the base game, plus replay value, plus mods, plus multiplayer/coop, plus GM mode * You get to ♥♥♥♥ just about every companion * You get to hear the Red Prince ♥♥♥♥ another lizard * Gay relationships  Cons: * Persuasion is poop * Roleplay is (kinda) poop * Somewhat buggy launch (last few updates were big and had major bug fixes though)"

Fat Cat on Mars,285,1,0,"October 2, 2017",Recommended,68.4,"While the game is not without its issues, so far it is possible the most beautiful RPG I have played in both story lore and visuals, and I am not a huge fan of the CRPG genre, only having played Pillars of Eternity before this.  I have yet to finish my very first run, but I can not recommend this game enough to fans of even just the RPG genre in general. There are a few issues regarding performance and not all the bugs have been squashed, but I highly urge paying the full price instead of waiting for a sale."

I didn't like it as much as the first one, felt they made the UI worse and found myself getting frustrated more at the story choices. Allot of no win scenarios, quicksave is friend.

The combat is really good, can fight in many inventive ways should you wish and on the harder difficulties you definietly have to plan out what you tactics will be, I probably lost 15-20 hours of gameplay due to having to reload after failing at various battles but I still carried on playing it.  The story is cool and I defintely like having a good story line in the games that I play.  Can recommend this 100% and I'll be playing Co-op with my friend as soon as we've finished our Co-op run through of Divinity: Original Sin 1. "

The game has a high valaue for replayability with an assurance that succeeding playthroughs will give you a different experience.    Last time I got so much hyped for a game was The Witcher 3.

Semaphor,336,1,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,133.6,Backed the game 2 years ago but only played EA a little bit because I wanted to avoid spoiling myself. Now I just had around 7 hours of uninterrupted game play for the final version and just stopped after finishing Fort Joy. It's everything I wanted it to be. My favorite game in pretty much forever so far.   My only complaint is that it is too easy to steal something by mistake because the characters you wanted to talk to moves away under your mouse.
|-Dr-|SS4,364,1,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,249.7,"The game is awesome, it's a must buy for all RPG fans.  Pros:   *The game is very very very detailed.  *Amazing sound track, stuck in main menu for an hour before I starts the game.  *Interaction with NPC and object.  *FULL VOICE ACTED, it's amazing.  *very interesting combat, (could be little overwhelmed for the people who are new to the game.)  *Cool characters  Cons: -The quest log is confusing, it something doesn't give you the cule, about what you are looking for, and sometime you would get a quest that doesn't seems like a quest, it just pops up in it anyway, for the person who like clear all the quest before progress next move, you are going to staring a full page of quest with no cule.  -Map is also little confuing, is not detailed enough for such a detailed world, combine this problem with the troubled quest log, it just make it worse, like other CRPG, you look at your quest log, than read your map, you would know where to go, but that's hardly the case in this game. It would be nice if you can drag a small window on the map and then the real world camera follows it, like those RTS game.   -Character movement speed, this is painful, I constantly going to wrong place, thanks to it's quest log, so I have to look at map again, move my camera on top of the right place, click on it, and wait for a minute for my character walk to the location, and this happens really often, wish they could add in the mechanic that double the time speed.  -Doesn't have a key that trigger all the NPC names, you have to mouse over them to see their names.  9.5\10, those are all the small problems, nothing major, and easy to fix, the game is still amazing, I wish they would do something like Dragon Age Origin, which allow you to switch between 3rd person and top down camera angle, the game definitely have the potential to do that, it also would fix a couple problem I adressed, but it just a personal opinion.

Musketeered,111,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,95.9,When I played the first one I thought it was amazing. Thought where can they improve on this. Well they did in so many ways.  Origin Stories are amazing. I played Loshe in my first playthrough and being possessed by a demon I had all sorts of interesting encounters like when I played my lute and the demon forced me to smash it. I mean I could go on but I don't normally bother writing reviews and this is just for the achievement. Point being if you have any love for RPG's with great turn based combat then you should absolutely buy this game.

Fred FredBurger,355,1,0,May 28,Recommended,48.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is OKAY at BEST. I wholeheartedly agree with some of the more critical reviews.  The first chapter of Fort Joy is the highlight of the game and after that it starts turning mediocre at times.  I tend to be a completionist. I was level 7 on all of my characters escaping Fort Joy and the game became tedious and boring to me in the swamp area.  At some point in the game you will realize that your choices really do not matter and that out of 4 dialogue options, you really only have 2 that are different. I cannot find myself to beat this game even after leaving the swamp area.  It sucks at times.  It's so boring watching the combat and the fights now are all the same crap. Even on normal difficulty the balance between easy fights and difficult feels off.  I shouldn't have left Fort Joy at level 7 (average is around level 5 i believe) but that's what the game allowed and I suffered for it. I don't feel divine. I don't feel powerful. I feel like I am doing chores running around and watching boring♥♥♥♥♥fight scenes and I'm not alone.  To add to this if you just wanted to rush through the story you would be underleveled and then have an extremely difficult time all the time.  This game needs dynamic balancing badly.  My friends all bought this game and we don't play multiplayer anymore. I am the only one who got past 40 hours of playtime and I regret it. 5/7 would game again."
Xariann,233,1,0,May 28,Recommended,27.0,"Wow! What a game! It's been a while since a game managed to hold my attention for a substantial length of time and this one certainly did.  I never finished the first Original Sin, and I wasn't sure if I was going to finish this one. I mainly lacked brain power to finish the first one after a long day of work. However, I guess now I am in a different place and I very much enjoy the depth of the stories, the many ways of getting to a result, the graphics and the combat. Having played my fair share of Might and Magic, XCom and XCom 2 I thought this was going to be a walk in the park for me, but I couldn't be further from the truth.  If you like fantasy, classic RPG elements, rich story and satisfying strategy combat I would encourage you to get this game. And don't forget you can play it with friends too."

E.T,271,1,0,January 20,Recommended,89.9,"Joins and surpasses Baulders gate, Fallout 2 and planescape Torment as one of the best isometric Rpg Games of all time.  Divinity: Original sin 2 takes the classic isometric Rpg improves it with combined spell effects a unique world and several quirks to diffrence it from the classics a most have for anyone enjoying RPG.  Recommend playing with friends, a party of 4 with your friends is awesome. but the game is super fun playing alone as well.  + Beautiful aesthetics.  + Excellent sound design.  + a unquie and intresting system for combat effects (watch one of the videos explaining the spell casting system and you     will see for your self).  + Challenging Enter an area before you are ready and the journey can be a bit rough.  The (slightly) Bad.  - Theiving system is a bit to powerful have a theif and you can basiclly steal your way through the game and get powerfull     gear and skill books that you wouldnt otherwise afford.  - sensitive controls, the combant controls can be a bit sensitive have happened a couple of times my characthers have walked instead of attacked.

Khalamity of the Hums,96,1,0,"December 24, 2017",Recommended,116.8,I had a blast playing this with friends and it's one of the best multiplayer D&D-esque games on the market. There is a lot of content. You won't burn through this game's story in 20-30 hours like most rpg's.
EnthusiasticTaco,43,1,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,35.3,"This game starts very strong but has the common inconsistencies of RPG, Free dialogue style play. (Similar to Fallout, Elder scrolls). I have spent almost 40 hours in the game to date and have enjoyed it, however, I never feel this game draws you into the world. It doesn't deserve 9/10 ratings, it is 7/10 at best. There are some game breaking mechanics that weaken a class or particular set of abilities.  Teleport is overwhelmingly overpowered, it literally breaks every aspect of the game if you use it right. You can completely alter the desired mechanic of a fight by using it. (unfairly) For example, Whilst a boss, I teleported him to my party and immediately killed him alone, well before his allies could help him and then when a neutral add spawned, i teleported his party members to the neutral add to get cleaved and then had to just fight the neutral add.   For example, Having a mage/wizard doing damage in a party primarily built up of Physical dps (Enemies have two forms of Armour, Physical and Magical) is pointless.  Their value as damage dealers drops to zero, they will hardly break-through any magical armour alone.  ""Tank"" classes don't exist as taunt has too short of a range, and most times your enemies will be immune to taunt.  I enjoyed the game, but simple things like save files and fast travels legitamtely break any immersion. You can save game in the middle of a fight and alter it to achieve victory at certain points. In one quest chain, your party is separated intentionally for the purpose of the quest. However, you can just fast travel to the centre of the quest zone with each individual character, there-by eliminating any effort.  The good;  Voice acting is incredible, if you enjoy DnD, then you'll love this game. Classical mode seems like the perfect ""Normal"" - It is challenging/formidable if you brazenly walk into a room of enemies, but if you draw them through fire or into a choke point then it becomes an even playing field.  LoS is your friend.  Probably the best turn based strategy game i've played to date.  Sneak and Thievery is just plain OP, you can't go without it.  Being able to sneak and put explosive barrels around enemies is vital to success in many fights, especially against stronger mobs.    Buy the game and make an opinion yourself. I stopped enjoying it at close to 40 hours played. The story was boring and uninteresting and even at 40 hours (Which is half way through the game).  Still worth a pick up - but the game really comes down to personal taste, it doesn't appeal to me.  i would love to see more games with this classical mode difficulty, by far that was the most interesting aspect of the game."

Quality Player,255,1,0,"August 1, 2017",Recommended,85.7,"Quick disclaimers: First, I have played less than 6 hours. If you have played Divinity before, you will know that this means my review should be considered first impressions. Second, I have only played Classic Mode, my so my review will be based entirely upon that experience. Lastly, I have only played the shadowblade class so far.  TL;DR's should come first imo: 1: If you liked Divinity: Original Sin, you will enjoy the sequel. 2: If you did not like Divinity: Original Sin, chances are good that you will not enjoy the sequel. 3: If you didn't play Divinity: Original Sin, but like D&D, fantasy, true open-world environments, and the most in-depth RPG you can possibly find, you will like this. If not, you may want to consider something else.  Next I'd like to get 2 small ""issues"" out of the way: 1: The store page boasts new elemental combinations, such as poison and fire to create explosions. However, this specific combo was available in Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition, so it's not something that I would call a new feature considering the Enhanced Edition was provided to owners of Original Sin for free.  2: There is no voiceover. I do consider this a small issue because even though the game has thus far been great without it, it really added a lot to the Enhanced Edition for me, and I feel it would be just as well-recieved in the sequel. Fingers crossed that they make it happen!  The rest of this review is going to be... less than organized. I will do my best to make it coherent, but I make no promises. ;)  So far I have found the combat to be challenging, but it also hasn't been terribly fun. I feel as though I need a few more levels and a few more spell slots before it gets to the point of being both fun AND challenging. Or perhaps my party is less than optimal; that is entirely probable since I've accidentally brought another shadowblade even though I am already a shadowblade... Granted, this has already made for an... err... interesting encounter involving a teleporting crocodile. Yes... a teleporting crocodile. It's just as terrifying as you think it is.  The RPG system is absolutely fantastic. It's incredibly interesting trying to balance your character's personality with how your NPC party members would like to be treated. For instance (!!!!WARNING: SPOILER!!!!) if you want the elf girl with the backstory (I'm so sorry, I'm terrible with names) to join your party, you have to let her gore a lizard by saying that you trust her completely (a previous experience with another backstory party member lead me to believe this was the correct choice to build trust with the elf. I did not gain any trust. It... may have still been the correct decision? I'm not sure, I didn't save/reload to find out.). Afterwards she wants you to let her speak to another person alone. I brought up the fact that she had just gored the last person I let her speak to, and the next person she wanted to speak to HEARD ME AND RESPONDED by saying ""There's no need for any of that here."" or something along those lines. I was seriously not expecting that. It's honestly some next-level immersion. Truly fantastic stuff, and I'm sure it will be a recurring thing throughout the game; that's just how Larion does things.  One negative (for me) has to do with the movement system. It's exactly the same as the first Original Sin, which means it is fairly clunky, and can lead to some poor situations resulting from accidentally stealing something. There are also issues with trying to navigate when something is in the foreground. Basically, you're pretty much always going to accidentally move your mouse over the thing in the foreground and it's going to mess with your pathing immensely. Unfortunately, the first area you arrive in is filled with tall objects to get in the way, which results in too much camera movement just to get around. I hope they fix this by making the camera view through buildings in the foreground much wider, and possibly a method that would allow clicking or holding the LMB to ignore foreground buildings.  I'm not really sure what else to say. So far it's turning out great! It looks gorgeous and runs well. The RPG system is amazing. Combat is a little rough so far, but again... 6 hours isn't much for this game, and I spent a lot of that time talking to NPCs, so I don't feel that I have even touched the surface of the combat. Heck, I haven't even played with friends yet! Speaking from my experience in the first Original Sin, this game is practically guaranteed to be better if you're playing with people you like. Even with the flawed movement system, I already think this game is worth the current (as of writing) $45 asking price."

Deltarizon,104,1,0,April 6,Recommended,175.3,"Well lets start off with a brief description of the game. You're a captive on a ship, a Sourceror, one of the most hated people across the land. Your foul magic attracts monstrosities known as the Voidwoken, nightmares from another dimension that seek to claim this world as their own. However, things quickly roll out of hand, and it ends with the ships destruction. Finding yourself on the prison island known as Fort Joy, you discover that you're no ordinary Sourceror; you have the potential to become a GOD. From there, the game plays out quite literally as YOU choose it, be it as a benevolent hero seeking to save the world or as a malicious villain who seeks to gain ultimate power. And, just maybe, you'll find an option that no one else expected, one that takes you through the Void itself... and finding power that scoffs at the Gods themselves.  As you can probably tell, there's a lot of choices to be made in Divinity 2 : Original Sin, and maybe you're thinking ""Oh god, it's another one of these games that plays out as a visual novel instead of a rpg"". Well if you are thinking that, shut the ♥♥♥♥ up, strap in, and read up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because there's quite a bit more to the game than that.   Now, the best part about this game is it's combat system and character progression; there are few other games where I can actually feel the progression of my character and the impact it has on the world around me. For example, in my very first TRUE playthrough of the game, 100% it, I did it with just two characters, both of them basically assassins; it was hard at first of course, but by the end of the game I could clear a room of 12 heavily armored characters with 2 characters and taking no damage. It truly felt powerful, and is one of my favorite gaming playthroughs of all time. So I thought, ♥♥♥♥ it, lets try a magical playthrough, might not be as fun as the first, but we'll get through it. Well. Lets just say a full elementalist party is quite a unique experience. The whole 4 person party felt powerful the entire game, and we destroyed everything in sight that we deemed ""Unholy"" or ""Unclean"". Felt ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious the entire way through, and I don't regret a moment of it. For my thrid play through, I went in with a full melee team, and got the exact same results, which has blown me out of the water and clear into the sky; the fact that no matter what kind of team you play you know you'll become a force to be reckoned with is fantastic, and lets you cook up some pretty kooky team compilations. If you don't believe me, go on youtube and look up some of the SOLO builds people can make; they play on the highest difficulty and can quite literally nuke entire areas with a single character. But I digress, that's a bit off topic, and not relevant to this review. So if you've ever felt let down by a characters power or capability, trust me, you won't feel that with this game.  Let's talk diversity for a quick second here. There are 4 main races in the world, the Dwarves, Humans, Elves, and Lizards. Each race has its own unique capabilities, and it's own racial traits, meaning that yes, while you can have a Lizard assassin, making it a human so it have bonus initiative (how soon it gets to move in combat) and extra critical chance (random extra damage) means you'll have an easier time. Or maybe you'll choose a lizard for your geomancer because you have the innate ability to breath fire, and ignite your oil based abilities. A dwarven Inquisitor stands ready to rush into your opponents because they have extra defenses against all forms of damage. And maybe your necromancer is an elf because elves can eat parts of their enemies to learn memories and skills they'd normally never obtain. No matter what it is, you'll find tons of combinations based off of race alone to make a unique and fun character. But is that where it stops? Nope, that's where we're just getting started. See, there is a unique twist you can put on a character; you can make them UNDEAD. Yes, that's right, a skeleton that walks and talks, and which offers other unique pros and cons. For example, an undead character will heal when poisoned, and take damage when healed normally. Skeletons can use their bony fingers as infinite use lockpicks. And most importantly, Skeletons don't have any nasty organs to inhale Deathfog, an uncommon terrain in the game which kills anything that breaths it, meaning that Undead are free to wander through it as they please. The only real downside is having to wear a headpiece at all times. (Which isn't even a downside, like, why would you decide to not wear an important piece of equipment?) But lets say you dislike making all of that troublsome character stuff, you just want to get in and have fun. Well, there are already a ton of premade characters with their own stories and quests to go on if you so choose! There's literally no way to go wrong with making a character in this game!  Hey, we almost missed the most important part of the game, the part where you become a god and stuff! Well friendo, that's what I saved for last because that♥♥♥♥♥♥is called SPOILERS, and I know that some people dislike those. So let it be said now that if you don't want to read any spoilers WHATSOEVER, then you should skip the next paragraph. Cool? Cool.  So as your character progresses through the game, they will discover the ability to use Source to fuel abilities. These are their godly powers, and are only usable by player characters and certain other npcs. This includes the abilites; Bless : Buffs an ally and clears any and all curses that afflict them. Spirit Vision : Is actually free to cast, and lets you temporarily see into the spirit realm, where you can see parts of the past, and even talk with the dead to gain their wisdom. (Or even just to taunt an enemy who bugged you.) Devour : Not it's actual name, but I don't use it often enough to remember it. It's also free to cast. You basically target an enemy corpse (or even just directly target their ghost.) and devour their essence, regaining a source point. Doing this too many times however can mark you with the ""Villain"" tag, which is not what you want to have on you if you're roleplaying as a benevolent hero. Gate : Again, isn't the true spell name, but works the same as the D&D version, creating a permanent link to another location within range that anyone can go through at any time. It sounds kind of dumb at first, but it lets you pull off some pretty wacky stunts in the game, and I've taken it on every character I've made so far. There are of course tons of other abilities that can be fueled by source points, far too many to list them all here, as each class has a few ""Ultimate"" abilities that you need source to use. But if you're interested in learning more about these godlike powers, then just look up a class guide and check out their abilities to get an idea of what you can work with!  Alright, well I think that if you've read everything I've said so far, that you'll get the idea I'm trying to tell you. The game's fantastic, and fun to play, especially with friends. One of the best campaigns we had was one where the entire party split up and fought to become the ultimate character. So if you enjoy shennanigans like that, and you love the sound of this game, then take a go at it! I really think that you'll enjoy the hell out of it!"

DazzBoomer,57,1,0,"November 25, 2017",Recommended,467.6,"With 380 hours played, I wanted to capture every Nuance of the game. I believe I managed to do so. With that said, the game is clearly a top choice in my book. It starts out with you lying down in a room thinking ""well this isn't going to be very much now is it?"". Then you realize just how wrong you were...  Well to put a long story short, I never imagined I would have logged so many hours in a game. But this game just simply doesn't stop. If you are looking for a game that will give you many hours of enjoyment, a great story line, great rpg based graphics, and just plain fun, then this game is seriously for you. You start out fairly weak of course. But normal for any game.. But as time goes on and with the great item rewards, you quickly become strong.. The voice over work they did in this game is also top notch! You can tell they really took alot of time with this game to get everything perfect. It is truly one of the best games I have ever had the pleasure of playing."

There is good reason to collect ingredients because they actually are valuable. The combat system is easy to understand and get into and allows you that great feeling of accmomplishment when you use superior strategy. The story is a good mix between familiar elements from past RPGs and new ideas and twists that keeps the game fresh and exciting.  Definitely a game most cRPG-lovers won't regret picking up!

Phantasmio,316,1,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,92.6,"A masterpiece of an RPG. I am brand new to the Divinity series. I haven't been this hooked on an RPG since titles like the original Dragon Age and the KOTOR games.  Incredible world, story, immersion and voice acting, gorgeous graphics and environments, solid strategic turn-based gameplay. I am floored that literally the first region kept me engaged for right around 16 hours where I finally felt ready to leave the place behind, and I STILL MISSED THINGS!  There have been so many moments and decisions I've already made where I go from joy and satisfaction, to curiosity and concern, to ""Welp, this just screwed up royally."" You have so much freedom and flexibility to do and act as you please, way more than I anticipated. You can fight and kill literally anything you see, which can result in loot, intense battles, quest progression, and/or outright closing out quest lines you wouldn't have expected.   You can play the ENTIRE game with up to four players in co-op, but you don't even have to be tied together to each other like you'd expect. You can go your own seperate ways, complete entire storylines and battle in completely different parts of the map, and can even declare war on each other if you please!  I haven't tried Dungeon Master mode, but essentially from what I've seen, its a mode where you can create custom campaign with a DM and four players playing in the DM's world, which they have absolute control over.  Every line is beautifully voice-acted and written, giving you the best of both worlds when it comes to taking in the story and events going on around you. You can either create your own custom character or go with one of the fully fleshed out stories of one of the Origin characters. I'd recommend going with an Origin character on your first playthrough, their stories are fantastically done, you'll find unique dialogue options in various conversations tied to the Origin character you're playing.  Combat itself is a very solid, generally a good challenge on normal difficulty and turn-based flavored, but with a major twist you won't typically see in RPGs. Your armor (both magic and physical) both act as their own health bar that prevent your Vitality (your actual HP) from decreasing.  Armor also will allow your character to resist negative status effects until it's drained. Physical will resist status effects such as Knock Down and Stuns until, while Magic will resist Status effects like Frozen, Petrify, Poisoned (unless you're undead) and more. You also have elemental resistances, which lower the damage of elemental attacks and helps you resist elemental-based status effects.  You can do extra damage with ranged attacks from high ground and decrease range damage you receive. Character deaths are permenant, and from what I've seen so far, you and your Party Members can only be revived with a Ressurection Scroll.  You have a bunch of different starting ""class"" templates to pick from, which can be fully modified to your content as you make your character. I say ""class"" because you can build yourself however you want. Just because you picked a Rogue, doesn't mean you have to exclusively be a rogue throughout the game. You can hybridize yourself as much as you please, so long as you have the skill points and buy the ability books to learn new skills from that class. You can even respec and recustomize yourself and party freely once you get out of the first region.  Lastly, you have Source Points, your Deus Ex Machina of abilites. These are your game-changer moves that are very powerful and usually something you'll reserve for dire circumstances, as Source is something you must find in the world, regained through rare items, or consume with certain abilties from corpses. You can also find Source Fountains, which have unlimited Source. I have only found two so far, one in each of the two regions I've been in, so I would have to say they are extremely rare. As long as you remember where they are or place a waypoint so you don't forget, you can always return to refill your party with Source.   Reviews alone cannot do it justice. I've been eyeballing this title for a while throughout it's early access and I only picked this up after hearing some great praise from a friend. I haven't been able to put it down since. The quality of this title is just incredible. If you love RPGs, save up the cash for it and get this title in your steam library ASAP."
Kawaii Thuggin’,105,1,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,61.4,"Honestly a breathtaking game. I know I'm not even halfway through but I'm looking forward to more. Eat, Sleep, play Divinity.  **EDIT**   I really enjoy playing this game couch co-op, split screened. Classic mode. Just defeated Bishop Alexander and it wasn't such a horrific fight (Boyfriend and I were quite anxious). If you've read on it, you do kinda have to pull some cheesy strats, but hey, this is ""cheese"" the game. Looking forward to way more and I can't wait to give my full review of this game.   P.S. Also if anyone is having trouble with the Bishop Alexander boss fight I've got one (or two)  key tip(s) for you...   Height. Get to the highest point possible on the battleground map, which is on the left of the battlefield. Have one character trigger the dialogue and have the rest go around the side and make it to the hghest point (it's where the mage lady is or whatever); during the dialogue you can teleport the character to where the rest of y'all are positioned. Make sure you teleport during the dialogue or else that character is dead in the middle of the fight until you get to a character that can tele that character to a safe point. Also the wormy will mainly proc wherever there's more characters (basically wherever the most aggro is being pulled towards, so avoid hitting the worm until the end cuz the worm will fight the magisters & Alexander for you). Good luck!   "

Oberain,583,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,170.0,"I'm going to be honest here; I didn't like the first Original Sin.  I found the combat surprisingly clunky, the ""two protagonist"" playstyle akin to mashing action figures together as a child and the NPCs bland and empty.  Just everything about it wasn't as good as the raving crowds claimed.    This?  This is amazing.  This is so far one of my favorite PC RPGs I've ever played...and I'm old enough to remember the original Ultima and Gold Box DnD games.  Most areas and quests have multiple solutions and you're not really punished for taking one over the other.  There are a few areas where lockpicking is basically required but besides that stealth, conversation or brute force are typically viable options to dealing with a problem.  Combat feels tactical (something most RPGs frankly don't really do anymore) with your choices in positioning, abilities and terrain manipulation meaning the difference between victory or defeat more often than just pure stats.  With careful planning you can beat groups of enemies better geared and higher levels than you, though it's still unlikely as one lucky crit can one shot a character.  There are very few mindless ""throw away"" battles once you leave the tutorial island.  Almost every encounter will be an actual fight for your life.  There are some areas the game can be improved further.  While your companions will pipe up more and put more of their character on display than the original, it's not quite enough.  The process in which it happens is sterile and lacks organic interaction.   Instead of the NPCs talking as if the other NPCs were standing around them, they spout their one line and that's it.  If, say, the Red Prince spoke to Fane or Sebille during the journey it would go a long way to viewing them as characters instead of interchangable henchmen that happened to have a  bit of backstory or a sidequest attached. So yes, as much as people like to♥♥♥♥♥♥on Bioware...this could benefit by being more like Bioware in that regard.  Another complaint is I never feel like I'm at the point I'm supposed to be at with gear.  I consistantly feel like I'm a few levels behind with my armor and health offering a totally negligable amount of protection with some enemies wiping my party before I even get a turn.  I don't even know how the game can really ""fix"" this other than perhaps tossing in an NPC somewhere explaining that each level gives shops DRAMATICALLY better gear and the difference between level 10 and level 12 is roughly 150% increase in defense.   Oh and do ignore the publications out there that act like plaiyng Undead is sooo hard.  You literally NEVER have a reason to not be in full armor and you can easily heal from poison damage and poison potions.  It's really not a challenge at all.  Edit and Addtions:  I had originally complained at some poor coding regarding playing a non-origin character and how playing an undead PC made the game think you were Fane leading to some broken quests and ridiculous immersion breaking dialogue.  It seems since launch most of these issues have been patched and some major story moments have been reworked.  It's disappointing they were in the game at all as I can't fathom why anyone would WANT to play as an ""origin"" companion instead of a real character and why playing a real character would end up being so buggy but...that's just me."
Behemoth,662,1,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,46.6,"A truly incredible CRPG. The best modernization of the genre that has yet been made.  So many options. I've started over three times and I'm not even halfway through the game. Much better combat balance than the first game, every encounter feels unique in some way. Better designed in general, feels more directed, and has better writing and more interesting characters.  Just fantastic overall. Even if you've never played the series before, pick this one up!"
Sasherz,"1,071",1,0,February 27,Recommended,34.0,"I do have to admit I like this game alot. From the good humor, graphics, and endless playstyle you can do. you can choose to solo and all the way up to a 4 party group and quests/convos change as how you do things in the game. the combat is amazing, I love the fact you can sneak around, flank from difrent angles in this game, makes it alot of fun.  but there are some serious flaws in the game. 1: the chest you get after act 1... The size of the screen you get up is stupidly tiny compare to your own inventory screen. The chest has absolutly no sorting for easy acsess to spesific items, everythiong is in the order you put into it.  2: not enough customization you can do to character, well there is, but its not enough  3: spellbooks you have allready learned says you allready learned, but its not true for skillbooks or books, adding a simple ""book allready read"" would be super handy  Im still gonna play this game alot, more than once"

RyoheiT,101,1,0,"December 23, 2017",Recommended,273.2,"Ahhh, Divinity Original Sin...I'm a huge fan of both the first game and the second one. It's the kind of game you'd want if you're into the PURE essence of RPG and want the game to last for a loooong time. The origin characters is very appealing and hilarious. The story of the game is very interesting and immersive. The music is beautiful and the overall gameplay is amazing!  I strongly recommend this game for anyone that wants to have a great time with their friends as well as playing alone. The amount of strategies and tricky plays you have to make (At least on Tactician mode) is just lovely and once you win a battle you really feel like you've accomplished something! :D  My advice to new players however is to start it on Classical mode; as once you feel like the game might be a bit too easy for you or once you've grasped the concept of the game and believe yourself to handle a bit more, you can change the difficulty to ""Tactician"" which make the AI's a lot smarter and thoughtful. Also buffing their Health, Defense and Magic Armor.  Keep in mind that once you've gone from Classical to Tactician you cannot revert on that savefile!! Secondly; Please try out the Origin characters on your first playthrough; as they come with a built-in little campaign of their own with a lot of extra details to quests and NPCs as you advance into later Arcs!  Most of all; Have fun in this amazing game!!  ~Ryohei~"

Valchrys,51,1,0,March 31,Recommended,357.8,"It's hard not to recommend the game because the engine has so much potential. There's a good game somewhere in here, but it's not the campaign. At least, not the end game.  I've spent hours carefully building the party's gear. But in act 4, every attack by an npc instantly stripes all the physical and magical armor off the entire party in one round. In the same round, the same npc that destroyed the entire party's armor will then cc the entire party. There's no tactics here.  I would say you can't approach the campaign like it's a traditional rpg, it's not. As a player, your goal is to break the game by finding the exploits the encounter designers didn't foresee. The encounter design is just terrible which is a shame given the potential of the game engine.  The only other thing that's really bad is the inventory management. There has got to be a better way for RPG's than having to manage hundrends of pieces of loot, most of which is useless. I would suggest to any RPG designer who wants to have a crafting system to have a way to turn that system off and hide the loot that is designed for that system. I'm getting physically sick organizing my party's bags so that I can find things when I want them. If I play again, I know enough now to avoid picking up crafting materials.  In short, the problems with this game are the stupid, gimmicky encounter design and the inventory management minigame. I hope that someone in the community will write a decent campaign for this game. Of course, that assumes that near infinite action points for the npc's and over the top damage isn't hardcoded into the game."

Pepin,257,1,0,September 9,Recommended,358.1,"So, my original review was too long for steam, so I have had to cut it down in places  Let me just say here that I love the game, although it isn’t perfect I admit. It is one of the best co-op games I have ever played, and this adds extra replay value for me personally. I have never been interested in the PvP matches, so I can’t speak of that myself. Below is all I could squeeze in, but I hope it showcases my opinion and experiences of the game.  Divinity Original Sin 2 (DOS2 from here out) is a CRPG with players having a party of up to 4 characters. The game uses a fairly familiar stat pool, which you can increase each level (Strength, Intelligence etc), but also includes talents (Feats) for some cool bonuses and ability points which can add things like damage, access to new skills, lockpicking and so on. Combat is turn based, and gets really interesting with the combinations of elemental puddles, clouds and status effects in play. The story is divided into four Acts, across four separate but distinctive areas, with side quests and companion quests spanning each one.  I love a good story in my RPGs and CRPGs so I usually put a lot of stock into this aspect of the game. DOS2 story was ‘good’ and felt interesting enough, with enough little twists to keep my attention for the duration of the game. As a story overall, I didn’t think that it did anything majorly unique, it didn’t challenge the players concepts of anything in particular, but it served the purpose as a framing device for propelling the player through the acts nicely. This may seem like a criticism, but really it isn’t any more than the ‘feeling’ I had playing through. I felt DOS2 does a lot better job with the story than Pillars of Eternity 2, but perhaps not quite as solid as something like Baldurs Gate 2, so take that as you will. The theme is somewhat a mixture of serious plot, with little nuggets of humour thrown in, which I like. In places the game absolutely does not take things too seriously, and there have been multiple times where I have had a little laugh out loud. Not tearing my sides or anything, but there are many chuckles to be had through the game.  The companions are well done, for the most part. Each has their own quest line and unique interactions with other NPCs throughout the world you’re in and this can lead to some genuinely surprising moments, and in some cases just having a specific person with you can land you in hot water. I personally applaud this because I feel it makes the world a little more ‘alive’ than some other titles. You might play through once with certain party members (or with none) and then on a subsequent game you might take other companions and get different reactions with NPCs you’d never really noticed before. The quest lines for your companions are (for the most part) well done. They’re long and detailed enough that you care about their story, and don’t feel like it’s a glorified side quest. Voice acting is done well throughout and I’m glad Larian Studios took the time to implement it into the game, and then improve it for the Definitive Edition, in places it felt a little lacking. Just a little side note here…If you’re standing in a densely populated area of NPCs, expect to hear lines of dialogue repeated ad nauseam. I’m looking at you market place of Driftwood…Still, it’s not quite as irritating as the man with many cheeses from Original Sin 1.  Graphically I love how the game looks. Traversing the world feels wonderful, and if it’s a new area you never know when a fight might break out or a dialogue option pops up with a player decision to be had. The animations of the characters are a pleasure to watch, and personally I love the look and feel of the spells. I have made a purely Air based mage for this reason alone, and I’m having a wonderful time so far. Another thing I have been critical of in the past is when battles take place in previously used ‘maps’ or ‘tiles’ (sorry to bring you up again Pillars of Eternity 2). I believe Larian deserve praise for not having this in DOS2. I appreciate that, when entering a battle, it is not like other games where you’re ‘transported’ to a ‘battle map’, it just happens in real time, but when I was exploring or fighting in the game I never felt like “Oh, this area again” and I appreciate that.   I do want to point out that the music in this game is just amazing and really adds another dimention to the experience. I know Larian spent a lot of time on this, and it really pays off. I find myself humming the theme music and battle music on a constant basis after I've played (much to the annoyance of those around me, since I am as musically gifted as a deaf otter).  Quality of life issues have been improved upon from both the first game, and the non-Definitive version of this game, which I really appreciate. Managing the inventory is nice and easy, transferring items between characters is fairly intuitive, the journal has been improved to be a little less of a cluster duck, and overall the UI is well presented. I’d like to expand this section, but I don’t feel there is anything specific that needs addressing. It simply works, and works well, so I’ll leave it at that.  DOS2 does not use a traditional ‘class’ system. Sure, you can make an archetypal Rogue, or Mage or Warrior etc, but you are never locked into anything. If you’re playing a heavily armoured Warrior wielding a two-handed hammer but you like the look of a buff spell like Fortify, just drop a point into Geomancer upon level up and learn the skill. Done. This adds a great deal of flexibility to character builds and playstyles, which really helps the combat of this game and your feeling that this is *your* character. I could talk all day about builds and ability combinations, but for the purposes of keeping this to a (somewhat) reasonable length I will say that character customization is huge part of this game.  Combat in this game is perhaps the biggest positive I can say, which is why it will be another long section (sorry, not sorry). As previously mentioned it is turn based, and tactical combat. The combat works on a 360 degree movement range (that is to say, it isn’t grid based), with advantages to having higher ground (insert Episode 3 meme here), and controlling the battlefield through a mixture of crowd control abilities and surface types. You can create combos with yourself or other party members by mixing certain elements too. For example you can make it rain, which adds the ‘Wet’ status effect to enemies in an area, then go for a frost type spell, which will then potentially freeze your opponent(s), making them skip their next turn. That being said, Armour types are a thing introduced since the first Original Sin. If you want to get certain status effects onto an enemy you will need to strip them of their ‘magical armour’ to do so. Usually by hitting them with magical attacks. For players using physical attacks, you will need to bust through enemy physical armour, before you can do things like knock them down, or cripple them, etc. This is such a huge part of the gameplay that it is impossible to cover in a review without going on for days, or making a lengthy video, so please feel free to look on YouTube or wherever if you want to see this in action.  Balance can be skewed through the game, which is my only real negative point (something which Larian has worked on to improve). Act 1 can be rough, but by the time you hit level 16, you definitely notice a jump in your parties power, which can trivialise some encounters. For those looking for a more consistent challenge I recommend Tactician Mode.   Overall I highly recommend this game for people who are fans of CRPGs and like (or don’t mind) turn based combat, with a real focus on positioning and a tactical approach. It isn’t perfect, but it’s extremely enjoyable to play either solo, or with friends."

Still a bit rough around the edges (Dialogue is a bit wonky, no voice acting, movement can be weird, I recently had an error where I could see everyone's detection radius around them as if I was stealthed) but very playable and very fun. Absolutely gorgeous too, and the soundtrack is as good as ever (Also lets you choose what the main instrument will be for your soundtrack? Interesting and actually pretty neat). I loved the first game but I already love the sequel more, the interface is much simpler and less tedious and the character customization is fantastic. Totally recommend it in early access."

Every hour I played in this game matched my favorite hours in Stellaris, Planetside 2, Crusader Kings 2, Civilization 5, the list goes on. I generally don't play this style of game, it's not usually what I get the most fun out of.

Rendo,75,1,0,"November 12, 2017",Recommended,289.5,"This review is somewhat limited as I have yet to fully complete the story, nor tried the dnd mode, yet I have a good idea of everything the game has to offer.   I think Larian have done a fantastic job in creating a grounded, well-rounded, and enthralling RPG. The narrative is imagnitive and captivating. Characters and npcs are unique and interesting, with good voice acting they really feel like individuals who each have their own personalilty, some could respond well to charm, others might threaten to kill you. Combat is challenging, fluid, and forces you to stay alert, using your head to figure out the best action to take. The visuals are gorgeous for the type of game it is and help to preserve the verisimiltude of the world.   One thing I would note is that the game is designed to be challenging by nature and is sometimes very slow and frustating, so if you lack patience and prefer only action, it might not be the game for you. For those of us who grew up playing Final Fantasy or other turn-based games, it is a very refreshing reminder of how fun these games can be if done right, especially with the unique twists this title adds. I would fully recommend the game, to the stage I am even using it for a college project where my task is to create an informative video, similar to ones seen by Mark Brown."
Frankie the Frog,133,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,122.6,"This game is easily better than the first. The graphics are impeccable and the voice acting and story continue to amaze me.

I have yet to finish my very first run, but I can not recommend this game enough to fans of even just the RPG genre in general. There are a few issues regarding performance and not all the bugs have been squashed, but I highly urge paying the full price instead of waiting for a sale."

The combat is really good, can fight in many inventive ways should you wish and on the harder difficulties you definietly have to plan out what you tactics will be, I probably lost 15-20 hours of gameplay due to having to reload after failing at various battles but I still carried on playing it.  The story is cool and I defintely like having a good story line in the games that I play.

The game has a high valaue for replayability with an assurance that succeeding playthroughs will give you a different experience.    Last time I got so much hyped for a game was The Witcher 3.

Kharn Terrer,131,1,0,April 13,Recommended,385.2,"One of the best games I've played in a very long time. It has captured all the fun of older rpgs such as Icewind Dale, Baldurs Gate 2 and Neverwinter Nights and expanded on it.  The game system is really fun and the fact that your initial choice isnt the be all and end all makes for a diversive game which you can evolve your character.  The traditional RPG feel in this game is massive and the lack of silly over the top new measures that are designed to get CoD players to like it is even better.  The story is amazing and the end boss battle was one of the best battles I've done in a long time. Its refreshing to play a game that isnt a total letdown or isnt filled with micro transactions.    10/10 would play again and again and again, hope they make another one."

Shadow,157,1,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,11.6,"So my early impressions:  Pro's  Good Graphics Good Sound Amazing character creation (I recommend Origin Character)  Con's  ~The questing can be difficult as the game does not exactly tell you where to go or what to do. There are some quest markers on the map but not for all quests. Basically if you enjoy a ton of exploring this game is for you. Personally I like my quests to be more laid out, it's just a choice thing. ~I also find the game fights to be very challenging, but also overly reliant on the game wanting you to use elemental combos. Trying to beat down an oppenent that is not weak to a certain element or combo just will not work. But using rain then hail, or oil then fire, or rain then electric = easy fight.  If I rated this I would give it a 7/10. If the questing was a tad easier/laid out more clearly it would be a 10/10 for me. Again that is just a personal choice with RPG type games. For sure a buy.  **Edit** Need to patch a few bugs I have found. The main one being the quest journal not updating."

So far I prefer the Origin characters cause you're getting more story mode for yourself, instead of just your companions. Speaking of which, the characters have great build, personality and of course, story. Ingredients needed for one to be attatched to a character of your choosing, mine for example being The Red Prince.  Allow me to share a funny tale while I am here...  So I'm in a full party and we decide to pick pocket this guy, but our rogue needs us to distract the guards.

Huge ammount of character customization and reactivity to choices you make it the game with an ending that morphs to your actions.

Even if you don’t like point and click games I urge you to try this game, I’m sure you'll change your mind. The level of immersion and character development is just unbelievable. The 6 origin characters bring out the absolute best in this game. The way each character reacts to the environment and your decisions along the journey will get you hooked.   And the combat... My god if it isn’t the most fun and addicting thing about this game. The number of classes and skills will guarantee that multiple playthroughs will not be similar.  Now onto the graphics... I don’t know if can give this game enough praise for their visuals and sound... it will immerse you into this chaotic and brutal world, the shift in music when you journey around will give you goosebumps. Each town and camp feel as if its accompanied with new ambient music.  Even though the price might be high for some, trust me it’s worth every penny! 70+ hours into the game and I still haven’t progressed much into the story. If you can try to get at least one friend to join you, I can ensure you that the enjoyment just multiplies.  10/10 A MUST TRY FOR RPG FANS! "

I've never been so into turn based games before in my life. Divinity Original Sin 2 has brought the power within me! I just hope to see the awesome expansions and updates that are coming up next. I can't believe this is considered Alpha! It doesn't even feel like it! It feels complete! Thank God it is in Alpha though, because tehn I know Divinity will have more awesome packs/updates :) Keep them coming! That's how you do updates!"

If you are a fan of classics such as Baldur's Gate or Gothic or Neverwinter Nights, you will be in love with this game like I have.

Prince,40,1,0,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,106.0,"Divinity 2 is probably the first game I bought during release since San Andreas came out, I've never been a fan of turn based combat, but Divinity decided to change my opinion of the genre. The game has a very casual approach to questing, namely you will never be given a little blip to run to, instead you're going to find yourself reading the clues and finding your way there on your own.  Some of the amazing things you can do on Divinity include : Rob literally every person in the game Murder swathes of people with deathfog barrels Beat up the pope - probably  Honestly, the game has so much content that I can't even pretend to know half of it, but I hope that over a few playthroughs I can atleast learn some of it."

I got this game maybe five days ago and have already put in 23 hours... and I am just getting started. I am absolutely hooked and cannot stop playing. I highly, highly, highly, recommend this game to anyone looking for an in depth RPG with loads of interesting skills, thorough character development, and fun turn based combat.  Pros: -♥♥♥♥♥♥load of gear, skills, playstyles, so on and so forth - Fun co-op that works well with friends - Fluid combat, never feel like the game is treating you unfairly. When you get destroyed, you know damn well why.  Cons: - You don't save characters, you save worlds. So you cannot join your friends game and then have them join you later. One player must always be host. The player who isn't host will have absolutely no saved data or files. (I don't know if this is standard or not... just felt sorta odd) - Does not hold your hand at all. Can have brutal save points. It's easy to get lost and not be entirely sure as to where you need to go or what you need to do. (Not technically a con, but may be viewed as one by some) - My game has crashed one time  TL;DR: Buy the ♥♥♥♥ing game. 8/8 gr8 m8"

There is so much to enjoy here and many deep mechanics to exploit.   The most important thing about this for me is that it is fully voice acted and better yet it is done well. There are many moments which the voice acting made the game much more engaging.   The combat is turn based howerevver currently the initiative system is frankly useless. You only need one character with high initiative to go first and one point more than other friendly characters to order them how you wish but it will always be: You, enemy, you, enemy, or enemy, you, enemy, you.   This game is also 100% multiplayer with a specific pet for making it a 2 player instead of a 4 player game."

error0044,160,1,0,April 1,Recommended,37.4,"This is a beautiful game, one of the best-looking games I've ever played. It runs smoothly at 1440p, and the detail is insane.   However, I've spent nearly 40 hours playing so far, and I've only just got past Fort Joy. I've re-rolled characters over and over again to try and find a build that doesn't get constantly slaughtered. I've also tried over and over again to get my party members to be more than useless, but I've had no luck.  This is a strange game to me, because I want to keep playing it, but every time I die I wonder why I'm torturing myself.  This is one of the first games I've played where you need to have a guidebook handy to remember everything. You have to remember which character class can heal, and how. You have to find hidden tricks in the game engine to stay alive in combat. You have to scout out areas without getting automatically sent into combat mode, so you can then arrange your characters strategically and then hope that they are far enough away to stay alive, but no so far that the game engine considers them to be outside of combat and their turn gets skipped.  In short, there is no learning curve to this game. It's more like a learning cliff - you either get it, or you don't. I recoommend this game, reluctantly. It's at least worth the two-hour refund window to see if you can handle it."

Avanglion,39,1,0,September 1,Recommended,417.8,The most fascinating RPG of this style and atmosphere I've played since 'Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask Of The Betrayer'. Usually I avoid comparing labels and franchises but this time I find myself in a lack of words strong enough to describe the enjoyment I feel while playing 'Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition'. Skipped playing the original version intentionally just like I did with DOS 1 in favour of its Enhanced Edition. In both cases I don't regret the decision. I trusted Larian to improve the base games and give them a level of polish only a fanatically devoted gamer can contrive and not only did they deliver but exceeded my expectations tenfold. This is the first game in a decade that I cannot stop playing 25 hours a day and it comes with its own content creation tool which again will be the first I'll actually get to use since I last dabbled with NWN's Aurora toolset. A huge THANK YOU! to Larian and Swen for enduring all the hardships so this moment could come. I wish them all the best. I don't know about tomorrow but today I feel like the future of electronic RPGs is bright and it's only because of the masterpiece that DOS2 DE is.

Foolish Observer,130,1,0,April 29,Recommended,171.1,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the best rpgs I have ever played. The music is wonderful, the gameplay is amazing, and the writing is top quality. The main selling point of the game is player freedom, and this game does not let you down when it comes to freedom.  This game is the type that you can spend any amount of time, or have any amount of runs going, and everything can still feel fresh and original because X npc didn't die on the second run, or because the cat became a friend, or because any other number of variables that can lead to a run being altered heavily. This game is about as close as you'll get to dnd without needing friends to play dnd with.  The combat is slow, tactical, and can be pretty tough when you haven't gotten the hang of it. Players can make builds that combine classes or are just a powerhouse in one particular type of combat, or they can put all their points into civil skills. Also, elemental combos are awesome. You can set fire to oil puddles or poison clouds, or electrify water/blood or steam, or teleport an oil barrel on top of someone who is on fire which causes them to explode. The amount of different ways you can tackle foes is truly amazing. It's fun, well written, has a great soundtrack, fun combat, and is an all around great way to lose countless hours to a game."

Second time went on to become a divine emperor of holy red dragons, vanquisher of demons, friend of dogs and chickens, the hero of Rivelon.  Third time on tactician, carefully micromanaging every single character, third time is the (or)deal!  And fourth time, going lone wolf, is the creme de la creme. Because every single minute of the game, while realising your own mortality and all the mistakes you've made, you also realize how much you missed during previous playthroughs. And how much you are going to.  And don't get me started on the couch coop factor here... Because this was just the beginning.  Long story short: This is the game you have been waiting for since Baldur's Gate 2. So much to do, so much to see, so much to cheese... together with friends! . . . . . . So many memories..  Like that time when you save a dog from a beggar who exploits him.  Like that time when you play hide and seek with a little kid to take his mind off the horrible fate awaiting him.

Gwynbleidd,86,1,0,January 19,Recommended,109.1,"What a brilliant game.  I am not a great fan of turn-based RPGs (or at least wasn't till now) but D:OS2 really changed that. The combat system is simply epic, both in terms of visuals and dynamics. It is so much fun to fight with strategies and due to the well-balanced difficulties, most of the fights are very exciting.  Exploring is also incredibly fun. The game has maps of decent sizes but more importantly, each act is generously full of well-scripted contents. You never know what you will find but you always know you will find something that makes your exploration valuable!  The story is quite compelling. Side stories, however, are often even more compelling. Additionally, all characters you meet have a personality that speaks to you on a human level. The attention to details for creating such a lively world should really be appreciated. Even animals have individually established personalities that make meeting them much more fun. Similarly, the dialogues are of the same quality. Very good voice acting and very well written lines.  The open-world aspect is, again, very good. The number of options you have through the gameplay is vast and unlike most other open-world games, your choices actually matter. Abundance of options applies not only to your choices of progressing through the storyline but to each part of the game. Almost everything expects some decision from you.    Graphics are very stylish and they look really good. Just by looking at the screenshots you can tell that this is a game with a fantastic world that will immerse you 100%.   The price is completely worth is without a doubt. You can easily expect 100-110 hours of gameplay from D:OS2.  In my opinion, if you like the genre of RPG at all, don't even hesitate to buy this game. This is a RPG masterpiece. "

I was, unfortunately, born too late to see Baldur's Gate 2 in all its glory when it first released, and by the time I did play the game, it had already felt extremely dated, and even still held a certain magic to its world.  Even though DOS:2 does not hold that same kind of magic, it has its own special moments while feeling like a modern game. The world has absorbed me, the characters have enraptured me and I think on an overall, this is one of the few games in which your choices actually matter.  Plus the price isn't your traditonal 60$, while still feeling like a bigger game than most 60$ games these days.  So yeah, if you're into RPGs, wonderful worlds and fun characters... Buy it."

frozen north,40,1,0,"December 8, 2017",Recommended,113.4,"Holy crap. This game is amazing.  So heres the run down. This game is in effect a massive game of dungeons and dragons, only the game is the dungeon master rather then your friend being the dungeon master.   The RPG aspects all feel really nicely done here, with concious effort being required to decide on how best to talk your way through a situation. The fact that every character in the game comes with voice acting is simply astounding, esspecially given just how many characters there are in this game.  As far as combat is concerned, its very similar to XCOM and atlas reactor. Each character recieves a turn, with the order being determind by each characters initiave stat. Much like XCOM and atlas reactor, every action has to have its strength and weaknesses weighted against the situation. To be completely honest, the combat system feels so smooth and effective, it makes the non-combat sections feel underwhelming as a result, and believe me, they definetly are not boring.  The multiplayer aspects are really nice. Personally, I recommend only playing multiplayer with friends, but that has more to do with ensuring cooperation then anything else. One nice feature of playing with friends is that it makes every moment feel more enjoyable.  All that said, I do have a few nitpicks about this game. The ingame market system can feel annoying at times, since only one person can foot the bill for an order of gear. Similarly, there will be many occasions where you can find yourself running through the same dialog again and again in hopes of achieving the best result.  However, despite everything else I have said, the single best thing about this game is its customizability. Built into the game is an editor that allows you to alter the map, the story, and where all enemies are located, which gives the game huge replay value. On top of that, the game is perfectly capable of accepting mods, which cranks this games replay value up to eleven.  Summary: Pros: + Absolutely amazing combat system that feels very familiar to anyone who has played XCOM. + Amazing graphics quality. + Insanely rich story and lore. + Dozens of hours per campaign. + Tons of replay value. + All voice acting is well done, and if you can talk to it, it has a voice. + Loot has a heavy ammount of RNG attached to it. + Everything is right there after you download the game (an increasingly rare thing these days). + Your starting class is completely flexible, and you can change just about everything about your starting class. + You do not need to stick to a specific class as the game goes on, allowing you to adapt as you go. + A ton of workshop content, and the games less then four months old.  Cons: - Things can get a little tedious at times, particularly if your not the best at keeping your saves up to date. - Purchasing from vendors is a little annoying, and I personally feel it could stand some more quality of life features. - You may find yourself restarting fights often as you realize what actually is happening.  Conclusions: Divinity original sin 2 is simply an amazing game. Almost everything about this game screams of quality, and feels like it is the result of honest game design. When people say this is a top of the line RPG game, they are not kidding. With extreme ease of modding, and a still growing community, its easy to see why this game is being called game of the year material.  Score: 9.9/10"

It has all the elements to be a rewarding game with satisfying game playability (i.e., you can play it in so many different ways you never get bored). However, when fighting multiple foes it gets disturbing that the player must wait ages until every one of them took a shot at your character.

Thanosphophyllite,250,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,166.7,"TL;DR: Every minute spent playing the game is an absolute blast and definitely worth every penny.  The very strong points of this game are the amazing versatility of the spells and combat mechanic, making you feel like you can actually come up with a sensible strategy to beat certain fights instead of just ramming into the beef fest head first. Unless you're playing a lone wolf pure warrior, in which case these two concepts meet one another. The ""puddle"" mechanic is intuitive and very fun to experiment with, for example making it rain upon your foes before striking them with lightning and finishing them off by turning them into a pile of frozen electrified flesh.  The only problem you'll encounter is that you need to make your own replayability of the game in the form of changing playstyle, class or upping the difficulty as the content is nearly always the same.  A few bugs here and there towards the end of the game but nothing major, it's mostly just spells unslotting themselves if you reorganize them a bit too fast and the such.  The soundtrack is the perfect balance of soothing and tense, keeping you on your feet yet feeling like you're playing a D&D session with friends, great fantasy RPG feel. The voice acting is pretty good too even if you do get these moments YARROW GIRL! You. It is you. I have found you. Vermin. What's this? I found something!  A very solid game to play alone for a RPG feel or with friends for a great love/hate relationship that the main quest helps you build up and even actively encourages during certain parts of the game, much like the coop of Portal 2!"

The only complaint I have at this point is the crafting system, which still seems very cryptic. I presume it will be improved for the final release, but as it stands, I was only able to craft some arrows and potions. The recipes and books I found were all restricted to arrows, potions, and some cooking stuff (the cooking stuff seemed pretty useless up to now). Apart from that, the game looks and plays beautifully. The history is pretty interesting as well and keeps you immersed and hooked for what's coming next. I actually felt a bit sad after beating Act 1 because I want to play the rest of the game so bad, but I know I'll have to wait at least a month until it gets released. In conclusion, if you played DOS1, you have to play this game. If you're new to the series and enjoy very well designed turn-based RPGs, with challenging fights and a myriad of different skills and spell combinations to choose from, then you also have to play it."

The combat is fun as ♥♥♥♥, the role playing is great, the graphics are insane for a top down game, it looks so good that it's comparable to highly modded skyrim (that's impressive) and the characters are interesting.

Echo466,65,1,0,March 14,Recommended,79.5,"So there are many things you should know about Divinity Original Sin II before you buy it.                                                                - Time and Dedication -    1: This game is a massive timesink. You have to invest into this wonderful gem of a game in order to take appreciation for what it is. If you are unable to put in 100+ Hours? Probably dont buy this game. I am currently forty hours into this game and I feel like I am just beginning to scratch the surface.                                                                 - Patience and Understanding -    2: This game is quite punishing and can be frustrating when you lose to the same group of enemies 5-6 times just because you are outnumbered 2/1. But knowing HOW to approach a battle and WHERE is key and if you do it wrong? There is a good chance a relatively easy battle will be much more difficult from such a simple miscalculation. Now this game is not nearly as unforgiving as its original predecessor? But it is still punishing.                                                                 - Things I like -    A: The story. It does a MUCH better job of gripping you this time and actually keeps the player actively engadged with what is going on, and if you played the first one? You know exactly how dry the first one was.     B:  Combat is relatively the same but minor changes here and there, positional awareness and planning are key.     C:  This is a wonderful multiplayer title, I can not even bring to mind one that challenged this in terms of just raw playability and fun. IF you have a friend or two that can play this with you the entire game? It enhances the gameplay by leagues. This game was made to be played with friends.                                                               - Things I dont like -     A: It has strayed away from D&D mechanics a bit more than the first one? But that is okay. It makes it more accessible for other players that arent interested in this.                                                                 *This is a big one*    B: The introduction of magic and physical armor to every piece of armor and apparel. Now normally this is fine? But the way it works now? The physical and magic armor acts as a buffer to the characters health. They have 1000 Physical armor? Your Barb wont be able to touch him for most of the fight as attacks will only hit the physical armor portion of his health. They have 1000 magic armor? Well your mage is now out as magic will not be able to inflict and damage to their health until their magic armor is depleted. In addition each of these respective new ""stats"", they also act as a shield against status effects completely while active. Cannot burn someone with magic armor, cannot cripple someone with physical armor, cannot blind someone with magic armor. This system feels absolute and a bit broken because if you have enough of both? You are immune to damage and status effects for that stat type until the armor depletes.      C: It can still be quite easy to lose yourself in what is going on. I have to constantly be re-reading through my journal to make sure I know what I need to do. If you spend a week or two away? Expect to sit there and decipher the journal until you have retraced your steps enough to know where and what you need to do.    Anyways.. This game is amazing. I love it and highly reccommend it if you have the time to put into it and of course a friend or two to play with. If you are on the fence about this? Dont be. Get it."

empiu,267,1,0,"November 13, 2017",Recommended,248.0,"So, I finished the game. What can I say to those, who came to read the reviews, thinking about buying this game? I think I'll use default pros/cons list of things doesn't mentioned on the game page:  +  Content/price ratio. It will probably took you about 80~100 hours just to complete campaign. Can be more, can be less.  +  Great feeling of adventure, even the main quest line feels more like an exploration rather than just following the markers on the map (hello to Skyrim main quest).  +  Neat battle mechanics. And again, it's not a straight line of pushing the buttons to deal damage (hello to Dragon Age combat). You can explore the possibilities of different spells effects, you must check resistances of your enemies, you should care about positioning your heroes and seeking good spell combos (at least on high difficulty settings).  + Good storyline (highly subjective opinion). Some nice twists (one final twist actually can be predicted long before it's happening by watching closely on a particular NPC characteristics, which is nice), characters with different stories (both past and ongoing).   - Despite the story being good (highly subjective opinion), I didn't find characters catchy or very interesting. I would rate them as ""okay, I guess"". None of them, I don’t know, touched my heart and made me worry about him/her. I guess it's because they rarely showing their personalities through some sort of a tete-a-tete dialogues with your hero and very limited interaction between party members.  -  Bugs. Few in singleplayer (mostly side quests that can't be finished properly and incorrect dialogue sequences, nothing critical, but still it is an unpleasant experience) and a lot in co-op mode (you can find lists of current issues on reddit if you really want, it's constantly changes because old bugs being fixed and new being discovered). Developers fixing them and rolling patches very often, but I think the game without a publisher demanding the product here and now should be polished better on its release.  - When I selected ""tactician"" difficulty, because default level was too easy and then I find that the “tactician” is easy too, I couldn't go higher because ""tactician"" doesn't allow changing the game difficulty. WTH?  - Patches are breaking localization. I played the game in Russian, but after some patches some spells began to use English names and some entries in the quest log changed the language.  -  And lastly, I want to mention the dark side of highly variable combat. Huge possibilities mean huge exploits and when battle was too hard for me, rather than winning because I learned something from my mistakes and improved tactics I usually won because I've found a way to cheat the game.  Major ""cheat source"" is stealth mode and NPCs reaction to it. In most cases, if all party members are Solid Snaking, they will just stay in one place obediently skipping their turns and waiting when you decide to show yourself. Only if combat can be finished without killing all enemies (I think this is how it works) they can start walking and searching for you like the source puppets from the last part of the game.  In the end despite all cons I've found this game really fun to play and rate it 8/10 spooky scary skeletons with buckets on their heads, totally recommend."

Ballistic Drop,92,1,0,"November 20, 2017",Recommended,42.4,"I have been looking for an ""old school"" RPG for a long time along the lines of Baldur's Gate.   This game reminds me of what I fondly remember those games to be. The games I used to play weren't as good as this, so I must be getting senile in my dotage.   Pro:  Character Creation. This is the first time I really wanted to play a non-human character. In older games you would get the same old Tolkien-esque non humans to choose from that in the end were just humans with different stat caps. The non-human characters in Divinity 2 actually give a whole other way to roleplay your campaign; from special abilities that shall we say, might be a little too gastronomically challenging for squeamish players to ones that add a delightfully morbid sense of humor to the game. Time to break out of our ""humans only"" team leader habits.  Tutorial. The first third (or so) of the game can be considered a tutorial for how to maximize your party's effectiveness. Much better than simply throwing you in a training room and showing the basic button clicks to make a fight happen.  Graphics/Art. I'm usually not overly concerned with every game having absolutely jaw dropping graphics to be entertaining. That being said, Divinity 2 is gorgeous. The attention to artistic detail has led me to walk into more than one trap while admiring the art on the walls.  Story. I'm not going to go into a great level of detail here, I want you to discover the story yourself. What you get however manages to balance what we expect from a fantasy RPG while adding new elements that keep you guessing whether you really are the hero or not.   Side Quests. Plenty to do there to take up all of your free time. One feature I really enjoyed is that there isn't always a good solution, and that solution might have repercussions down the road you did not expect. No Mass Effect Paragon system here folks.  Cons:   Learning curve. After the tutorial adventure the difficulty can seem to ramp up very quickly, I found this to be primarily due to the sheer amount of customizability you have available to you. Be patient, save often.  Pathing. Sometimes your party does not like you and wants to go sightseeing when you are clicking on the next objective. Keep an eye on where they are going.   Divinity 2 is a fantastic game that shows you don't have to go to the AAA publishers to have a memorable experience. Give it a try and gnaw on a couple of dismembered arms for me. "

I have only played a couple of hours in the story campaign but 95% of my time has been spent playing around with the GM mode. There is load of workshop support, the sound, graphics are all fantastic. The only downside is the limitations of useable content when creating campaigns with the GM mode, most of it can be accesed via mods but I don't understand why this stuff wasn't accesible in the first place.

I like that you can choose whatever start class, and then switch in mid game and use some of the points just to get the one skill that you want to use.  The main downside of the game is the quest browser. It's quite difficult to keep track of all the quest (even more if you are playing with 3 other friends in your party) and you cannot even search for name of quests or npcs that gave you the quest, so either you remember everything, or you get lost among all the quest.  Still I would recommend it to everyone who likes rpgs, the transition between the normal game and the fights (that are turn based) is really good."
Jack Bright,251,1,3,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,120.3,"So I woke up on a boat in a bunch of rags tied to a table and realized this isn't my usual state of affairs, and I was on a boat to auschwitz but for cool people. I met some elf lady and she was carving names into her arm like an edgelord and was like ""yeah I can read memories by eating people"" and I said ""No ♥♥♥♥ing way"" and she's like ""Lemme lick your arm I'll prove it."" So I gave her my SKELETON ARM, because I decided my character would be 2spooky for this world, and she was just like ""lol whatever"" and did it anyway. Turns out she was telling the truth. Neat.  Then some stinky red lizard looked at my teeth and said I would be a bad slave becuase I can't cook. Shortly after that some old woman blew the boat up because she's got a touch of the dementia.  I woke up in a concentration camp for wizards and then I murdered people extorting a woman for protection money, and then she took me into a cave and a small child asked me to play hide and seek so I did and then he showed me a secret door and I went inside and he introduced me to an old giant skeleton and the old skeleton told me about a secret passage next to a statue. So I went that way and I found that elf chick that licked me spying on a stinky lizard and she was like  'Nobody gets the drop on me, I should just kill you.' And I was like ""Okay but what if"" ""You didn't"" And she was like 'You know that's a pretty good point lets go kill the stinky lizard' And then we did.  Turns out some smelly lizard enslaved her and she's on a grand revenge quest and the names in her arm are who he made her kill so she doesn't forget what he did, and on her other arm its the people she's going after. I wasn't sure if it was edgy or badass so I decided ♥♥♥♥it lets just go.  Also apparently I'm the second coming or something, so that's cool. But there's like six other people who are also the second coming and there can only be one in this scotland. Speaking of, one of them is the elf that's helping me, Sebille or some♥♥♥♥♥♥ Anyway...  Anyway, then I went through the passage and I ended up in the KKK's basement, but I couldn't figure out how to get out, so I killed some teleporting crocodiles and just kicked the front door in before murdering EVERYONE, then went back into the basement and then I killed their flesh stitcher and then I ran into the swamp and fought a skeleton that made illusions so I could get a wand that eats magic and then I used it to kill the grand wizard.  To be more specific I used it to bypass a bunch of screaming jesuses that shot lightning at you , then summoned a giant worm because I tried to fix my armor, and then murdered the pope and his teleporting gimp sidekicks (but not really because he had an extra life in his backpack)  Anyway, after that I stole a talking boat by convincing the door to the captains quarters that in order to answer the security question to recover the password I had to know the password, so it told me and then realized that it was dumbtarded. That's how I showed up in Driftwood. I got told ""YOU NEED TO BE A BETTER WIZARD. I went snooping about for leads. Which led to...

""TELL ME HOW TO BE JEEEEEEEEESUS"" 'lmao no' ""Mang I'll ♥♥♥♥ing kill you don't be a♥♥♥♥♥♥quot; 'okay holy♥♥♥♥♥♥just eat this space lobster heart and leave me alone' And then I ate the space lobster heart and got superpowered. It was pretty cool, but I needed INFORMATION. ""What were you stealing"" 'It may or may not have been nerve gas' ""Who did you give it to?"" 'I cant tell you that he'll kill me' Then I slapped him with my pimp hammer and he tried to tell me but then he exploded. Weird.  Anyway I asked some demon possessed lizardman to give me more magic and he just did it for free, demons are pretty cool like that. Well, mostly free, he just wanted me to kill some cultists I would have done anyway, so that's pretty good. He told me where to go, and I went for the place with a really unimaginative name where I'm supposed to jump in a lake and become the new god king or something like that.  Got there and Sebille was like ""Hey you know that ugly lizard that enslaved me and made me kill a bunch of people? He's there."" and I was all 'oh♥♥♥♥♥♥m80 what are we gonna do' And she said ""Look dude you're actually a pretty cool guy (♥♥♥♥ yeah I am) and you've really been a huge help to me and I feel like I can trust you, because you've literally been solving the worlds problems left and right (You're god damn right I am) so I'm gonna teach you how to use my slave scar he gave me to stop him from instantly mind♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me by proximity"" So she did and then we hugged and stuff and it was really weird because she said I have soft hands and I think she forgot I'm a skeleton.  Anyway then we landed on the island and the pope was there and he told us to ♥♥♥♥ing murder everyone else so we did because, well, they were♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Also killed that stupid lizard that enslaved my comrade. She was pretty hyped about that.  We get to the door to the god-making kiddie pool and she says ""Hey, you can be god. I really think you'd be better at it than me, since you're such a hero.""  Which is great because I actually kinda like this chick and didn't feel like smashing her... with my hammer.  Anyway all the other casuals were there and they were like ""WE GOT KILLED BECAUSE OF YOU BUT THE GLORY OF SATAN BROUGHT US BACK TO LIFE AND WE'RE GONNA ERASE THE WORLD LIKE IN UNDERTALE.""  To which I replied ""that's pretty gay"" and beat them all to death again. But right as I was about to become the god emperor...  Some edgy ♥♥♥♥♥ resurrected Ganondorf to teach her how to kill all the magic so he gave her an ancient Shamwow that sucks up magic instead of liquids and then she cucked me out of godhood and killed the pope by using her magic dishrag to♥♥♥♥♥♥all the power out of the divinity granting tanning bed and ran away like a♥♥♥♥♥♥ but ganondorf is getting out of his bondage leash and murdering ♥♥♥♥♥es when edgelord isn't looking so he can be the new hokage.

Holon,57,1,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,252.6,"I am over 200 hours into the game now. And I can say by now, this is my personal game of the year 2017. It's brilliant. It's a great coop game as well as a great solo game.   I would have to write several pages to review why this game is good. But I'll try to keep it very short:  + Full voiced over  + Entertaining NPC talks with a lot of laughs you get from it  + Interesting and often suprising story, that will change in the details, when you play another character build.  + By far the best turn based combat system I have ever seen in a game. I usually hate turn based fights, because it often feels like playing chess. This game does it so much better. Just go on youtube and watch some videos on fights. You will see how nice it is designed.  + A pretty intelligent and challenging AI that makes combat really hard and strategic if you like.  + Beautiful graphics. The world looks amazing.  + Beautiful music / soundtrack  + Very good level design. When you enter the world, you want to explore it, and you can get lost in it in a positive way.  + Perfect coop implementation. You can join a friend's game at any time and take control over one of his companions. Or you start together and create your own characters.  + The skill system is pretty huge and you have a lot of customisation options.  I really try to balance this review and tell you good and bad things about this game. But I have hard times to find any bad. This game is just so bloody good. But here aare things, I would like to see improved. They are highlevel critic on an almost perfect game:  - The quests in this game are recorded in some kind of diary. I like that kind of questlog, but it needs more information added to it: It doesn't tell you what level that quest is for, which is kind of a problem, as you have quests ranging over 6 and more levels in a region. I started to explore a region but didn't do every quest I got right away. So when I started to solve quests later on, I ran into a lot of enemies that were 2 or 3 levels higher than my group. In this game such a difference in level often means you don't stand a chance, especially on higher difficulty. So I would like to see a level written to each quest in the diary. At the moment you pretty much have to finish quests as you get them, which makes it a bit of a linear experience. I would like to be more flexible.  - Also the log doesn't tell you where you got a quest and not all of them get pinned on your map. So it's really hard to remember all the locations, which could also be improved.  It's very hard to review this game, because it has so many aspects. The world of DOS2 is full of things you can discover, I got a lot of laughs out of the dialogs and I like the story. The story also really surprised me at times, you can't predict how it will go and in the details it will be different depending on what character you play. Which is brilliant and gives this game so much replayabillity. I am in act 2 at the moment and I am almost 200 hours into the game. This game is vast... it's just huge. You get so much content, I didn't expect this game to be that big.  I love this game to be honnest. It's probably the best RPG I ever played in over 10 years.  So, there you are, this game is worth every penny. Great Story, amazing voice over, great combat, great RPG, great graphics.... what else? I love it."

Ren,4,1,0,February 1,Recommended,141.0,"Initially I was thrown off by the turn-based combat system, but after delving further into the game I absolutely loved it, I've now completed the game on classic mode, and got around 150-200 hours of playtime out of it, though I plan to play through it again with higher difficulty, and different characters for different individual questlines. Overall I highly recommend DOS2, and would encourage anyone to try it out!"
★ Eth ★ The Spurned,479,1,1,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,108.2,This game is better than the original Baldur's Gate back & Neverwinter Night's multiplayer days. You love Crpg ---> Own it. No excuse.  Btw : One of the best soundtrack you'll ever heard.
CptClutch,175,1,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,104.8,"Finally an RPG that does significant strides in bringing the pen and paper core values and ideas into a digital format. It has room for improvement, but thats what Original Sin 3 is for!   As is, at the time of writing this review, Divinity has come the furthest amongst its RPG peers in reaching a new degree of freedom and player agency. The amount of effort put in by Larian Studios often breaks the fourth wall and smacks you in the face from behind the monitor. It is just that obvious. You constantly come across something SO stunning, that you feel the need to take a step back and savor the full scope of what the game is trying to acomplish. This game reaches for the distant stars and it touches the Sun. It is truly magnificent."

Every single quest feels like it has purpose to it, I really enjoy the combat (even if it can be a little cheap with the stuns sometimes) and the story is amazing. The Devs seem to really care about making a good game, and honestly the only bad reviews i've seen so far have been people raging about how to min-max their characters. Besides that, this game should have Extreamly posative reviews!"
Don,332,1,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,187.0,"It's hard to find games like this anymore.  The care they put into it shows, it comes packed full of content, you can easily get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of it; the story is extremely rich and really long, and the turn based combat is fun, interactive and also challenging. If you like tactical turn based combat I recommend you choose Tactician mode, it will make you earn every combat you start. Enemies will not respawn in this game and there is a finite amount of experience you can get, which is good because it saves you from having to grind to level up.  The music is really good too, it gives the game its personal touch and adds a lot to combat and exploration.   The gameplay is a callback to the classic RPGs era: isometric camera, point and click movement, multitude of meaningful different dialogue choices and choices in general, a strong emphasis on exploration to find secret caches and treasure, and a quest system that will not hold your hands. This game rewards you for being attentive and reading, more often than not you will not get clear quest markers that show you exactly where you need to go and what you need to do, you'll have to figure it out by yourself. The same goes for puzzles.  The world building is great, you will feel very inmersed into the lore, the characters and the world you're exploring. The world you play through is divided in 4 giant maps that you will access sequentially, however, you can freely explore and do things in the order you prefer within each one of these maps.  The writing and voice-over is also excellent, although sometimes a bit cheesy, but it's clear that most of the times it was intentional. The story is a lot more mature and dark than the first original sin's. Humor is nice. I recommend you take the Pet Pal talent with at least one of your characters, the dialogue with animals is just too good, sometimes hilarious and other times depressing.  As for difficulty, you have 4 options: explorer, classic, tactician and honor, which are easy mode, normal mode, hard mode and hardcore, respectively. Honor mode will delete your save if your entire party dies so you have to start over from the beginning, definitely not recommended for your first playthrough. Tactician is challenging at first and it will make you sweat each and every victory, but it's also really rewarding, and once you get the hang on the game's mechanics it will feel a lot more natural and accessible. Classic is still challenging especially if it's the first time you play the game, but enemies will have less health and armor, and the AI will be more prone to making tactically inefficient decisions to give the player some more room for mistakes. Explorer is the difficulty for people who just care about the story and want to breeze through the combat as quickly as possible.  And finally, multiplayer and extra features. Coop is a blast, playing a campaign with a friend is great. Up to 4 people can play together. the game adapts perfectly to multiple people playing the same campaign except for one thing: the dialogue. Only the person who starts a conversation with a NPC gets to choose the dialogue options, which honestly can be a little frustrating when you and your friends don't agree with something, but otherwise everything else is perfect. The game also features a GM mode where you can create and edit your very own campaign, and then share it with everybody else. I can't talk too much about this feature though because I have only checked it out real quick, it looks very complex and the editor seems like it gives the user a lot of tools, so all I can say is that the potential is there.   Overall, I won't be surprised if this game becomes a classic and we start seeing a lot of new CRPGs being born thanks to it. The developers have earned this success, and this is a 100% recommended purchase for every lover of the genre, and also for people looking for a great time even if they're not very keen on the genre."

ateo.ars,226,1,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,57.4,"This is a great game, but you need to be aware of a few very frustrating game mechanics. You will be thrown into battle with enemies who, even if they are your level, will have far better spells/skills/abilities at their disposal and will almost always have far better field position than you do to start the battle(even if you attempt to position your forces prior to starting the encounter). You will also frequently be outnumbered even if you have a full party and you will probably die horribly if you take on any group that's above your level. If you're a fan of loot pinatas, you will be disappointed. You will fight and win very challenging batlles where the odds are stacked against you only to loot bodies that are mostly empty or have junk loot. You will be frustrated and rage-quit if you don't approach every battle with caution and aren't prepared to cheese your way through fights, when needed. The game is still rewarding despite these things, but it is not a simple hack-n-slash RPG."

dominoblox,58,1,0,"November 9, 2017",Recommended,97.2,"If you are a fan of games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and other RPGs games based on heavily entrenched lore, you will most assuredly love this game. It's polished, has a lot of history attached to the world, and every character feels important in some way or another. On top of that, every tiny thing I move or interact with feels like it has changed my game for the good or for the bad.  Pros: -On my brand new Alienware desktop, the game looks pretty dang good. There are a few issues I can mention, but it would only be me nipicking. I'm not a huge stickler for graphics anway.  -Everything feels ALIVE and like I am just a tiny part of a huge world. -The combat feels fluid and well-refined. -The story is enthralling. Cons: -The combat, though fluid, has a few issues. The first is that there is a great deal of metagaming that takes me out of the world. On many occassions, I found a battle completely impossible until I restarted the game, positioned my characters around the future battlefield for an advantage, and then triggered the battle. It feels like I'm cheating, and I don't like that! -I know it's for space, but I'd like to have an option to have a free roaming world where I can travel between islands. Once you're done with a location, it locks you out!  Other than that, this game is splendidly done and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story. :)"

Lima,402,1,0,May 6,Recommended,92.0,"In short, one of the best games to buy if you are looking to spend some time with friends, in a co-op adventure. If that is what you are looking for, I highly suggest to just buy it, and not read the reviews.  What is there that others haven't already said? The game scores extremely high on both professional and user reviews.  The way you build your character, roleplay him/her and interact with your companions, creates a unique and memorable story. The game is full of life, an interesting story, amazing gameplay mechanics (seriously, I sometimes couldn't stop thinking about ways to build my character, since you can literally do any build that you want. I ended up as the summoner, healer, buffer, croud controller of my party the first time we played, with six hotbars).  A friend of mine told me that a game is worth its price if 1€ (or whatever currency you have) equals to 1 hour of gameplay, and we passed that mark a long time ago. Definitely worth your money and time for a great experience.  I'm excited to see their next game :)"

Mumen Rider,106,1,0,"December 29, 2017",Recommended,91.0,"When I started reading reviews calling this ""the greatest RPG ever made,"" and even ""the greatest GAME ever made,"" I had to  try it. The reviews reminded me a lot of The Witcher 3 and it was for the same reason that I bought and played that game way back when and it's now considered my favorite game of all time. So yeah, I got a little excited.  Then I played the game and I felt kind of disappointed. It seemed extremely difficult and I wasn't used to getting the cold shoulder from a game. By that I mean compared to most games this one does not hold your hand, you won't get arrows pointing you in the direction you need to go, everything you need to know is actually in the dialogue and/or read in notes and books (and sometimes a rare hint from the narrator). I kept feeling confused on where to go and who to talk to and the quest system seemed kind of clunky and hard to understand at first.  I'm ashamed to admit, I asked for a refund at about the hour and a half mark. Then I went a couple days thinking about the game and that I couldn't believe I couldn't get into it. And then I thought about it again and again and realized that something was nagging at me and I couldn't stop thinking about it.  So yeah... I bought the game again. I looked up tips this time around on which characters people like in their party and which skills really help early game (Lone Wolf changed everything for me). And most of all I had to learn to slow down, stop running through rooms like nothing matters. This game made me change the way I approach video games. I started to appreciate the detail and get into the story, and I have to say, the story is absolutely amazing. The characters are all interesting and the situations I found myself in during certain points in dialogue had me on the edge of my seat.  Now I'm 40 hours in and I can confirm, absolutely one of the greatest RPGs ever. And I haven't even had the pleasure to experience co-op with a friend. 10/10"
KRiP,171,1,0,"December 27, 2017",Recommended,79.8,"Best RPG game I have ever played.

Jon Rando,341,1,0,"December 4, 2017",Recommended,148.9,"Wow, this game is just a breath of fresh air in an age of sequels and recycled gameplay.  I've been playing through this almost exclusively co-op with a few friends and it has just been one of the best co-op experiences I've had in a long time.  I can’t really think of a comparable quality story driven, co-op RPG on PC since maybe Neverwinter Nights and that is 15 years old.  I really like the fact that everyone is free to run around and do their own thing and have their own conversations without generally locking the party into cutscenes or anything like that.  You can choose to follow your companions around and listen in on them, or you can split up and report back what you've heard in your own conversations.  Not having control of your character usurped every 5 minutes for an unskippable cutscene is quite nice.  Over the last few years, I’ve played some Dungeons & Dragons on Roll20, Skype or Tabletop Simulator.  Playing through this game feels very much like the D&D experience, even borrowing many of the mechanics like passive perception and attacks of opportunity.  Both in and out of combat, the game gets a lot right in this regard and really shines as a result.  And speaking of the tactical turn-based combat, it is really great.  I’ve mostly played it co-op with friends, but I played the first little bit single player as well.  Either way you go it is very fun, and can be quite challenging at times if you get in over your head.  And you can’t just eat a lot of deaths either because your resurrection options are limited, at least early on.  A lot of the combat revolves around elemental mechanics similar to that of Magicka.  So for example you can spill oil on the ground, ignite it with fire, put the fire out with some water thus turning the water into steam and then you could shock the steam cloud and make it electrified.  This makes for interesting situations in combat and there are often unintended side effects if you are not careful.  The combat AI of the opponents seems passable enough.  I have seen them do some pretty questionable things at times though.  In particular, during one fight we had an enemy archer spend 2 or 3 turns shooting arrows into a barricade because it didn’t have a clear shot at our rogue.  There have also been a few other instances where they would take actions which seemed to benefit our side more than theirs.  We’ve only played on the ‘classic’ normal difficulty though so I can’t really comment on the higher difficulties.  The controls can also be a bit tricky at times, leading you to accidentally move when you intended to use an ability or vice versa.  But this mostly just comes down to being patient and paying attention to what you are doing.  If you try to do things too fast before the animations finish it can mess you up.  Also the game won’t tell you if your ranged attack (bow/wand/staff/etc) will hit something in the environment so you just need to be aware of things.  Although I’ve somewhat taken a back seat in the story development process in our play through, the fact that all the interactions with NPC’s are voice acted really helps.  And while every side quest isn’t Witcher 3 levels of amazing, I haven’t had any complaints.  You can even take a perk and talk to the animals if you want to be just a little be more depressed along the way.  All in all I have been thoroughly enjoying this game and would gladly buy an expansion or another sequel in this series.  I look forward to future releases from Larian Studios and hope they can continue to provide truly phenomenal games without all the shady modern business practices like endless microtransactions and loot crates."

The game is pretty similar if you took elements from D&D and turned it to a more XCOM style turnbased game. The writing is excellent and got me hooked immediately and there are so many different ways to play and interact depending on your characters. You're free to choose the party you want and the characters are all pretty unique (went with a lizard, skeleton and a possessed mystic myself)...and you can play it all in co-op instead if you prefer. Just regret not checking out the original when it came out, but this sequel is extremely hard to pass up.

When I want to play an RPG i look for something like the witcher, skyrim etc...an awesome adventure, where I feel as if i AM the character, in a manner of speaking, So I can really enjoy the game, and get attached emotionally and physically to the story..( i know im getting to deep here ill tone it down LOL)..... HOWEVER...I have been looking for a new rpg to play recently and this popped up...You can understand my hesitance even with the reviews of people creaming over this game :P...because this game is isometric/top down...   SO know after 20 or so hours I GOTA say a few things...ONE.....this game is hard as F**K lol...BUT I RESPECT THAT.. :) no easy ride for this pizzaman..TWO.....im, what some might call a graphics wh*re...and this game is pretty as F**K :)...and lastly.....YES..it is top down, and YES i freakin hate that view...BUT...these developers, have created something MAGICAL...i cant quite say what it is..but I can NOT stop thinking about this game....I have ACTUALLY managed to feel pretty freakin immersed in it aswell...I am VERY HAPPY to say :) .  Considering I literally could not STAND playing any game like this in the past( diablo, this, etc...) I would definately recommend it. Thank you developers for opening my eyes to a new world of video game..ing..age...ness ;)"
Finzy,242,1,0,"December 30, 2017",Recommended,29.6,"Best 'western' RPG I've played in ages, brings back memories of playing Neverwinter Nights and the like back in the day. The game is pretty similar if you took elements from D&D and turned it to a more XCOM style turnbased game. The writing is excellent and got me hooked immediately and there are so many different ways to play and interact depending on your characters. You're free to choose the party you want and the characters are all pretty unique (went with a lizard, skeleton and a possessed mystic myself)...and you can play it all in co-op instead if you prefer. Just regret not checking out the original when it came out, but this sequel is extremely hard to pass up.  Soundtrack's great too, and just about everything in the game is fully voiced which was a pleasant surprise."
Alarah,503,1,0,"November 26, 2017",Recommended,77.1,Probably one of the best top down RPG games I've ever played. It's certainly the best in recent memory.

I was a fan of the first Divinity Original Sin game, and though I never finished it, I was not sure what to expect from the sequal.  This game has exceeded my expectations so far, through it's story, the characters thus far, and how they expanded the classes and added to the combat system.  The changes/additions to combat is what I have been happy with most.  Of course the music is great.  The voice acting is not the best, but it is still enjoyable."

I've been playing RPG's since Darkstone on PS1, and I have to say this is my favorite. It's complex, the characters matter to you, and every time I think that I'm a god that can't be stopped, DO2 puts me in my place.  I finished the game but I still cant believe its over. My party is done and went on to do amazing things. I'm going to start a new game, with a new party, but I'll always have my memory of my first adventure with DO2. God I'm excited to begin a new story.   This game is a home-run. The gameplay takes a little bit, but getting your own personal strategy down is wonderfully rewarding.

MooCows,416,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,77.0,"I'm sure by now you've seen many reviews raving about the pros of this game (and there are many pros). So rather than rehash everything that's fantastic, I'll keep this review brief by listing my few quibbles with the experience.  1) Misclicks: I've had a number of irritating cases of accidentally clicking on something I didn't intend to. Outside of combat this generally means I accidentally stole something because the vendor I tried to click on moved. It would be great if there were a ""don't steal crap"" option to avoid this. In combat it usually happens when I try to attack an enemy and click terrain instead because their model isn't static, resulting in wasted AP at best, and being on the receiving end of attacks of opportunity at worst.  2) Companions: The only complaint I have here is that they seldom seem to react to your choices and actions outside of direct conversations with them. So far it's seemed too easy to keep all of my dramatically different companions happy as clams - even two who would or should be trying to kill each other in their sleep.  3) Co-op: Sort of a pro and con... Your online experience may vary. The game puts no real restrictions on the behavior of other players in your game. There are a lot of ways they can help or hinder you (including betraying you in the middle of a battle). So, like with traditional pen & paper games, the people you're playing with determine whether or not you will get any enjoyment out of it.  If none of those serve as a major deterrent for you, then you are going to greatly enjoy this game. I honestly can't recommend it enough to RPG fans. I've enjoyed all forty hours that I've put into this game at the time of this review, and I feel like I've barely scratched the game's surface."

Run out of lockpicks? Pick up some nails, use a hammer on them. BOOM now you have lockpicks. Keep slipping on ice? Well if you havent used all the nails up on making lockpicks, put them on your boots. BOOM, slip proof boots.  Someone really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥you off? Turn them into a chicken. Need a temparary sheild? Drop a painting in front of yourself. Cant get round a door? Either use force and brake it down, or play it smart and teleport around it.  The list goes on. I honestly cant wait for my second play through to see what i missed. And then my third play through to see what i can do better.   Before this, ive never truly enjoyed a game.

They opened the unique experience window based on the race you choose. They provided extremely original options to mask your character and alter their NPC treatment mid playthrough, and continued the tradition of allowing an unlimited number of ways to complete a quest.

memopek,409,1,0,January 6,Recommended,152.2,"+ Co-op All the game!  + Good dialogues. They are all voice acted and well written. It does not bore you to hell to listen to people. Some talking options are sometimes a little vague but it's water under the bridge.  + A Good story Not like it's an emotional tale, but the game takes the extra effort to give you actual characters with backgrounds and sets you in a cool world, built neatly.   + Cool Combat Turn based combat has its downsides but this is one of the games where it is fun. You have a nice variety of useful skills and combat options. Also you can build your characters as flexible as possible and respec them if you want.  + Tons of Content You have all these different routes and dialogue choices to explore throughout the game, which is a heaven and a nightmare because you feel lost in it and have to sink your 150 hours into the game.  + The Art It looks and sounds good.    This would be the best game ever if it was not for a series of intersected problems. They're not so bad themselves but together these problems make me think twice if i want to play the game.  - Entering the combat in a wrong way. If you did not get a good headstart and hit your enemies before entering the turn-based combat or get your characters in the right positions, you might as well as load. Most of the time you're the underdog (even more with higher difficulty) and have a power/stat disadvantage. They could've at least give the player half a turn to move, not even to attack.  - Random Encounters Entering the combat feels a little clunky, but what makes it worse is that you won't know when you'll be entering the combat. Were you talking to someone? They turned hostile. Were you exploring a cave? You were ambushed by high level monsters. They are fun and interesting when they are sparse but turn out to be a hassle if you come across them in a row and go into a dozen of long/difficult fights. This game needs more fights where you can actually plan before going in.  - Turn-based combat takes time Who knew you'd have to wait your turn right? You wait for AI to think. You wait for the animations to happen. You wait for your co-op mates. You miss your turn if you get stunned. So if you walked into a random encounter, or get defeated in a fight and want to try again, you will sit there for a while.  - Loading screens take time I admit this might be on my end because my hard disk is getting old. But i can still tell the game is hard on my hard disk. When i get into combat, i always find myself having to decide whether to load right there to get a better headstart or wait to see if i can somehow pull through, learn the fight then try again. So I end up waiting for something. The need to load often does not help."

vermouth,56,1,0,January 6,Recommended,117.9,"Just finished the first play-through on tactician difficulty... still sinking in at what was said at the ending and ponder the strange feeling I have now that my adventure has come to a close. This game has the most intriguing, twisting, imaginative, and board-sighted story line. In my first play through, because apparantly I have built my character so strong that I defeated the final final boss with the click of two bottons (though involveing some tricks), the combat has not been the actual high lights. It was the stories that kept me hooked. I never knew where it would take me, never knew what's the truth of this world that I am in, the relationship I can develop with my partners, the images I could fill in with my imaginations to paint the world as what I want it to become... It is just a shame that this has to be only a game, not a real universe; the ending had come too fast: where my own imagination truly ran wild and where the game presents what should be the most remembered part of the story, it just felt that it ended very quickly. But this is no complaint of the game, endings like this had me recalling every past moment of my adventures and together the ending actually painted a very big picture, but it was just so good that I can't help but want more!!!!! I could honestly play the ending over and over and over again!!!!  If you decide to play, my best advise would be to paint a picture of the world while you advance through the stories. With every conversation, quest, discovery of secrets, encounters, the picture would become a little bit clearer. Through this you can capture the true beauty of this game! I just hoped that I didn't have to realize this until the ending and had to take it all in at once :)"
Gilmez,113,1,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,217.3,"THE STORY: This is by far the most densely rich lore I’ve played through from any game I’ve played, where almost everyone and everything is connected in one way or another. Creating a living and breathing world, where one’s actions and decisions will affect their adventures through Rivellon. The part where this game shines the most, is how it gives the player choices on how they want to advance the story in any way the player chooses to play. Choose to be good, evil, just or whatever mood you choose, this game adapts to it and guides you to the end that your choices led to. While I’ve only completed Fane’s Story (in the moment of writing this), the endings it gives you will satisfy however you played. While you can choose how your adventure ends, the game lets you know how those actions will affect Rivellon in the future. The reason why I love this story is how grim and real this story plays out, no one is truly good or evil, it’s all a grey area, but it’s your choice on how you want to navigate in it.  THE COMBAT: There was never a dull moment every time I went into battle, or stumble on to one. While combat is turn-based, pre-battle is when things become interesting. Some approaches I found to be more fun is laying out traps and pre-emptive attacks on unknowing enemies. I can go into combat with my enemies clinging on 5% health and wipe them out with one attack. This is true liberty that this game gives to players, it gives you the tools and it’s up to you on how to use them. And this is just combat, skills can give a creative twist to combat. You can chain attacks to deliver devastating blows to your enemies or toy around with them by unleashing various Statues Effects and skills that can either immobilize them or transform them into chickens. All this creates a simple yet complex toy box you can play with. Finding out what seems fun and effective will make you want to seek out the next battle and unleash your battle plan.  THE MUSIC: I do not, in any way, have any complaints or criticisms about the music. The only thing I can say is that it is Divine. The music makes Rivellon and in turn makes you believe that it is a real place and these characters who live in it are part of a giant play. The 4 instruments that you can pick (while you build your character) creates the mood in how you want to play and you can change it any time you want.  This is the best RPG for this generation. While there are quite a few bugs the developer needs to fix, this doesn’t affect how much I love this game. "

E⑨id®in,160,1,0,February 7,Recommended,90.9,"We were somewhere around Fort Joy on the edge of the ocean when the source began to take hold. I remember saying something like ""I feel a bit sourcemuted; maybe you should fight..."" And suddenly there was a terrible storm all around us and the sea was full of what looked like huge slugs, all swooping and screeching all around the ship. And a voice was screaming: ""Divine Lucian! What are these goddamn animals?""  The early looting had also given me 300 gold in cash, most of which was already spent on extremely important revival scrolls. Our luggage looked like a mobile junk shop. We had two bags of food, seventy five notes we didn't care to read, five tomes of crafting books, a salt shaker half full of stardust, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored potions, bottles, grenades, spellscrolls and also a quart of healing brew, a pile of intencies, a case of portraits, a bunch of rabbit paws and two dozen golden spoons. Not that we needed all that for escape, but once you get locked into a serious trash collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the crafting. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of a crafting binge. And I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon."
Dome Chomsky,78,1,0,"November 2, 2017",Recommended,213.1,"10/10, Larian has done it again  Everything I liked about the enhanced edition (my first title by them) has been kept, and a few things I didn't like have been improved upon.   The combat is really fun, and is developed. You should check out some videos or streams to see if you think you'll like it. I first played on classic but then started a new playthrough on the more challenging mode, Tactician.  The NPCs and voice acting is top notch, and this goes for the generic scholar, trickster voices you can choose for your own player as well. The voice acting for the origin story characters Lohse, The Red Prince, Sebille, Beast and Ifan are amazing as well, there was one part where I nearly cried it was so touching.   If you like RPGs, or especially if you liked Divinity Original Sin, then  get this game, you'll love it.  If you really like a challenge, try the game on honour mode...it is the hardest difficulty, and I'm considering playing through again  P.S for me, time to complete each act:         Act 1: 9 hours, Act 2: 17 hours, Act 3: 6 hours, Act 4: 10 hours  total 42 hours (2nd playthrough technically, original time to complete act 1: 24 hours pre-release) "

Kafungalung,59,1,0,February 10,Recommended,196.7,"Pros: If the developers of this game used the same game engine and style and made a D&D title my life would be complete. As someone who hates turn based games this game is amazing. the graphics and story are captivating, the abilities are satesfying and easy to understand and the game is just great. In addition the game does not cradle you one bit you will find yourself quickly defeated in any fight where you don't play to your party's strengths and avoid their weaknesses. and with turn based combat fighting lots of enemies at once can be a massive challenge forcing you to eaither set up traps or pick them of a few at a time. I spent over 150 hours on this game right when it cam out and that brings me to the cons as i see it.   Cons: This game has a lot of gear in it so you are often getting new items and then you have to go through and see which out of all the items is better for you and there no fast way to do that. That mixed with the crafting in the game means you can even augment certain weapons making them do tons more damage. I found that a weapon with a fire or air stat could have poison added to it for more damage then runes to add even more but there werent any other dmg types i could add making the weapons a bit odd to sort through some times.   Crafting is in no way intuitive and some items are just downright silly to craft. I will give a spoiler and say that honey and honey jars are the most op crafting item in the game since they can make charmed items which sell for large profit. You will often have to scour a website to craft things and thats a big con for me and i have 3 monitors.   Verdict: Over all the game is absolutely amazing and i give it a 9/10.

I was playing with two friends from the Phillipines and South Africa.  Everything worked perfectly. Inventory swapping, skills, combat, movement, and our connection was stellar. The graphics are good, the music even better.  Items feel rewarding, the skills are coherent and interesting to combine.  The storyline is average amongst good RPG's.  The gameplay is great fun, and it was surprisingly and thrillingly challenging at times."

Jackrabbitofdoom,140,1,0,"December 3, 2017",Recommended,55.7,"It's a lot of fun even if you're new to RPGs in general.  Combat - Simple, VERY open system in which you can attack anybody at any time. (Good for setting up fights with neutral characters you don't like or friendly characters that have good loot.)   Dialogue/Story - The dynamic between the templar-esque people and the summoners is fun. Skills such as the one that makes you able to talk to animals serves as a way of having a unique experience that most people wouldn't pick. Though I have to say, some of the mid/later game story is pretty boring and I skipped through most of it.   Graphics - Game looks good as♥♥♥♥♥♥ I really enjoy the elemental damage appearance. Ex. Pouring rain on an area then hitting it when lightning.   Control - It's mostly point and click for everything. There are some pretty nice things in the game though, like the ability to detach certain members from the main party.   Replayability - I have yet to play half of the classes and two of the races in the game.   Overall - 9/10. Besides the story that begins to drag a bit near the mid/end game, it's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of fun."

I've only played for about 16 hours so far and already I can see how vast the game is, how my choices have affected me thus far, and how I even wish I could start over knowing what I know now.

New additions are the choice of making your own character or choosing a pre-set one with variations on back story. There are significantly more spells and skills than before and you also have physical and magical armour. Being able to gain an advantage on the battlefield using height is a welcome addition. However, where I feel it is inferior to the first is the humour, there seems less in the sequel and I didn't care much for the playable characters. Despite this minor flaw I absolutely love the game and would recommend it to fans and newcomers alike."

This does not effect the overall game story, however, it's the extra content that they don't need to include, but do that impresses me. I have to give this game 10/10.

Shyrahja,146,1,0,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,95.2,"I am unsure where to begin with Divinity 2 at this point. This game has been and still is an amazing journey you can take on alone or with your friends.  I am hardly convinced with most of the games I play but Divinity has me on a collar. I cannot look away or stop playing it. I already am at 50H and haven't even experienced the whole singleplayer campaign.   The fact that you can talk with every single NPC, including animals (if you got the ""Pet Pal"" Talent early on), that you can explore every corner, find new clues and ways to secret caves or find treasure chests. All those aspects are a big yes for me to recommend Divinity2.   But was that all? Hell no. I haven't even covered 20 percent of what this game is capable of yet! I really enjoy freedom. I want to choose what to do, how to do it and, that should I take the wrong path in a conversation, have to deal with the backfire. Each race reacts differently towards NPC's (as do they. A lot of racism going on in this game) while adding more tags to your character such as ""Barbarian""""Scholar""""Outlaw""""Mystic""""Soldier""""Jester"" and ""Noble"" gives you the options to get more information out of them or successfully persuing them after they saw you stealing. (I have to add this since it caused me great pain. Do NOT click on a trader while they are walking by. I accidentally stole a bottle of wine instead of talking to the trader and hell on earth broke out. Never steal wine guys. NEVER.)   Each races armor looks different depending on what armor you give them. The same helmet looks differently for each race which means just getting out all the armor sets probably took ages and I am glad they put so much detail and work in this game. You can see the development teams heart in it. A great game that is meant to be so much more.  It is sometimes hard to keep the playerbase or even raise those numbers shouldn't there be options to replay the game after ""finishing"". Divinity did everything right. I am putting the word ""finish"" like this simply because of the fact that you will be having a hard time completing this game 100% if not impossible. So many options depending on what you chose while creating your character, while talking, whom you talk too and how. So many options to go, so much to explore, so many ways you can complete a single quest will make it hard for you to not get lost in this wonderful world <3  And I haven't even started to talk about the Game Master aspect. So far I have't been able to look at them simply because of the fact that the moment I have freetime I play the campaign.... I might be addicted at this point.  The option to create your own campaign, invite your friends or upload your work on Divnity's Steam Workshop will give you a never ending adventure.  My friendgroup started to use Divinity as DnD platform. Our GM creates the world and through Divinity you don't need to only imagine it, you can actually see and play your personal adventure.  Since the game is turn based you have everything a little RP heart needs to be happy.   In short: If you enjoy exploring, a never ending adventure and have a great time with your friends while playing Divnity's campaign, a downloaded one from the workshop or your own this is the game for you to play.  A long awaited tripple A game that has been worth all the wait. Hands up for an amazing adventure I will be enjoying for a long time!"

HappyThoughts,144,1,0,February 16,Recommended,178.9,"I loved it. It gave me the same feeling I had when I first played Dragon Age Origins, and I couldn't wait to wake up in the morning and get back into the game.  The turn by turn combat is rather well implemented. There aren't really any ""easy"" fights, or if so, very few, and as such each and every encounter has it's own importance.  If you read the forums a little you'll find out that there are both people complaining that the game is too easy and people claiming it's too hard. I think it is rather well balanced. Succeeding in combat relies a lot on knowledge. This means that you might find the first few battle frustrating . You will fail, but what's important is what you learn from each failure. Some fights can require quite a few reloads and changes in both strategy and equipment. As you learn to optimise your character as well as fully utilize the environment to your advantage you will progress.  The story is engrossing. I am unfamiliar with the previous games so I speak as an initate to the world of divinity. Each character of your group has a well-fleshed out backstory that you'll want to discover and a personal arc that you will want to see to its end. Dialogue is in general rather well written. The lore is easy to get into. There are a number of well-written books and scrolls you can read, but you can do without them. You'll grow familiar with the world as you interact with it, and nothing ever really confused me. For those of you worried it follows the current ""You are the Chosen One"" trend, well, it does, but only kinda. You are A Chosen One, not The. The world doesn't bend over backwards to suit your whims. In fact, Chosen Ones in this game seem to get very little respect.   The quests are all excellent. There isn't any ""filler"", you're never really told to go kill and 10 people. I think we can all fondly remember in specific games we played a select few ""memorable"" side-quests, distiniguishable by the fact that they had an actual story with their own characters and that they lasted more than ten axe-swings. In this game, most quests are as such. And they nearly all have multiple possible endings, depending on how you approached them.  The music is top-notch and the graphics are rather pleasant.   The wide-variety of possible character builds, the character stories to live through, and the multiple endings to each quest grant this game an immense amount of replayibility.   As someone who isn't really a perfectionist but does try to empty his quest log, my first run-through took me about 40-50 hours. For a 45 euro game, it's a fair amount of bang for your buck. "
Crow,124,1,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,109.2,"A game who got turn-based action right for once, the story is interresting and change's slightly based upon your choice's however if i had to say what i feel is best i would say ""voice acting"". The voice acting of this game reaches a yet unseen height in quality similar to that of a movie yet npc's are not limited to 2-5 lines like most but actually appear to have countless options based on what direction the conversation is heading towards.  I am thinking of how i would play it on my 2nd playthrough while i am not even past my first playthrough and what i would do differently for example if i should more of a villain, hero or merchant etc.  If Larian where to make a 3rd original sin i would buy it... i never tried the 1st but i got hooked from the 2nd even if it had a couple bugs and its crafting window was lacking."

Super Elephant,107,1,1,July 5,Recommended,140.0,"D:OS 2 is a thrilling and beautful adventure across the fictional land of Rivellon in search of becoming the next divine. The combat is deep and unique, and especially more fun on the higher difficulties where more strategy is involved. The voice acting is spectacular, particularly with the main cast of pre-generated characters.   However, where the game falls flat is its lack of originality in the main storyline. Esentially it brings upon the typical ""hey theres a bad guy and hes bad and powerful and we gotta be more powerful to defeat him"", with a few extra bits thrown in there. It continues like this until the later acts where it picks up. Thankfully, there are individual character stories that take place between for those before mentioned pre-generated characters, if you happen to have any in your party.  Overall, being a $45 title with easily 65+ hours content on just your first play through alone, this game is easily worth the price. And even being, there is an upcoming ""enhanced edition"" which is said to improve on the main story. I cannot recommend this game enough, despite its downfalls in the story and is easily in my top 3 games of all time."

Great character customization, a lot of different classes to choose from, you can learn new skills along the way by finding the scrolls as you play the game. Every companion and character you find/talk to in this game has an incredible story, every choice you make changes the way the story goes. The turn based combat is really fun, challenging and sometimes frustrating.  Now, this game doesn't hold your hand, it's not easy, everything you do requires thought and good decision making, from combat to quests, finding stuff, everything is a challenge. If you're looking for an easy story RPG you should probably look elsewhere.  So far i've only completed the first part of the game, or act 1 whatever you wanna call it (took me about 13 hours), and it might already be the best RPG i've ever played.   I give it a 10/10.

[TT] Valentinus570,175,1,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,121.1,"It's a great game !  I got the feeling that I played a good old paper RPG like D&D: no proper ""classes"" (you mix your own), lots of characters, speeches, way to fight, ...  BUT it's definetly not for everyone. It's like you have a sadistic GM: it's tactical, it's hard, it's unforgiving. Prepare for looots of quicksaves, or you'll live with the consequence of your acts Wrong move ? Dead. Wrong answer to a pnj ? Dead. No characters with this ability ? Quest almost impossible to do  Exemple: (very very light spoiler ahead)  I could talk to a Scarecrow: i start the discussion, and then there was NO way, at least for my character as i build it, to avoid the fight with 10 scarecrow 2 level above of me -> F8 to last quicksave	  For those who know/liked the 1st opus: run for it ! Same base, but everything is enhanced, with a lot of quality of live changes, etc ...  I highly recommend for anyone who like hardcore tactical RPG. Btw, the 1st opus is absolutly not needed, for lore-lover, a quick wikipedia summary is enough.  -----------------------------------------  C'est un super jeu !  J'ai vraiment eu l'impression de jouer à un RPG papier oldschool genre D&D: pas réellement de classes (on construit celle qu'on veut), beaucoup de personnages, de dialogues, d'actions possibles ...  MAIS, c'est pas un jeu accessible/plaisant pour tous. Comme dit plus haut, c'est comme avoir un MJ sadique: c'est très stratégique, très dur et impardonnable. Préparez-vous à souvent faire des quicksaves, ou alors vous vivrez avec les conséquences irrémédiables de vos actes. Faux mouvement ? Mort. Mauvais réponse ? Mort. Aucun personnage avec telles compétences ? Quète quasi-impossible.  Exemple: (très très léger spoiler)  Je pouvais parler avec un épouvantail, je lance donc le dialogue, à partir de là, il n'y avait AUCUN moyen, pour mon personnage tel que je l'avais construit, d'éviter le combat avec 10 épouvantails 2 niveaux au dessus de moi -> F8 vers la dernière sauvegarde rapide	  Pour ceux qui connaissent/ont aimé le 1er opus: prenez sans hésiter ! C'est la même base, mais tout est amélioré, avec beaucoup de modification ""quality of live"" , etc ...  Je recommande vraiment pour tous les fans de RPG ou tactical game un peu hardcore. Au fait, le 1er opus n'est absolument pas nécéssaire, pour les puristes, un rapide résumé wikipédia est suffisant."

Don,332,1,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,187.0,"It's hard to find games like this anymore.  The care they put into it shows, it comes packed full of content, you can easily get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of it; the story is extremely rich and really long, and the turn based combat is fun, interactive and also challenging. If you like tactical turn based combat I recommend you choose Tactician mode, it will make you earn every combat you start. Enemies will not respawn in this game and there is a finite amount of experience you can get, which is good because it saves you from having to grind to level up.  The music is really good too, it gives the game its personal touch and adds a lot to combat and exploration.   The gameplay is a callback to the classic RPGs era: isometric camera, point and click movement, multitude of meaningful different dialogue choices and choices in general, a strong emphasis on exploration to find secret caches and treasure, and a quest system that will not hold your hands. This game rewards you for being attentive and reading, more often than not you will not get clear quest markers that show you exactly where you need to go and what you need to do, you'll have to figure it out by yourself. The same goes for puzzles.  The world building is great, you will feel very inmersed into the lore, the characters and the world you're exploring. The world you play through is divided in 4 giant maps that you will access sequentially, however, you can freely explore and do things in the order you prefer within each one of these maps.  The writing and voice-over is also excellent, although sometimes a bit cheesy, but it's clear that most of the times it was intentional. The story is a lot more mature and dark than the first original sin's. Humor is nice. I recommend you take the Pet Pal talent with at least one of your characters, the dialogue with animals is just too good, sometimes hilarious and other times depressing.  As for difficulty, you have 4 options: explorer, classic, tactician and honor, which are easy mode, normal mode, hard mode and hardcore, respectively. Honor mode will delete your save if your entire party dies so you have to start over from the beginning, definitely not recommended for your first playthrough. Tactician is challenging at first and it will make you sweat each and every victory, but it's also really rewarding, and once you get the hang on the game's mechanics it will feel a lot more natural and accessible. Classic is still challenging especially if it's the first time you play the game, but enemies will have less health and armor, and the AI will be more prone to making tactically inefficient decisions to give the player some more room for mistakes. Explorer is the difficulty for people who just care about the story and want to breeze through the combat as quickly as possible.  And finally, multiplayer and extra features. Coop is a blast, playing a campaign with a friend is great. Up to 4 people can play together. the game adapts perfectly to multiple people playing the same campaign except for one thing: the dialogue. Only the person who starts a conversation with a NPC gets to choose the dialogue options, which honestly can be a little frustrating when you and your friends don't agree with something, but otherwise everything else is perfect. The game also features a GM mode where you can create and edit your very own campaign, and then share it with everybody else. I can't talk too much about this feature though because I have only checked it out real quick, it looks very complex and the editor seems like it gives the user a lot of tools, so all I can say is that the potential is there.   Overall, I won't be surprised if this game becomes a classic and we start seeing a lot of new CRPGs being born thanks to it. The developers have earned this success, and this is a 100% recommended purchase for every lover of the genre, and also for people looking for a great time even if they're not very keen on the genre."
The Geoff,91,1,0,"December 26, 2017",Recommended,131.5,"This game is rad as hell. There is so much attention to detail in every aspect of the game. It easily makes it into my ""Favorite Games of All Time"" list. I would do a long, in-depth review, but I feel like it would be better received if I did pro's and con's. However, know that I could gush about this game for hours.   PRO'S -Great Story -Incredible attention to detail and good flavor text -Great characters (The sassy lizard man and sassy skeleton are my favorites) -Combat is INSANELY fun, yet difficult -There are easily over 100 hours of gameplay in a single playthrough. I haven't even finished mine yet, and I'm at 94 hours while writing this. -Tons of quests -Different factions you can help, or ignore -You can have sex with a sassy skeleton -Cool environments and areas -Magic is actually fun and useful. (Something that I think is sometimes rare)  CON's -Pathfinding can sometimes make you facepalm -Character creation could be a little more in-depth -Some quests could use a liiiiittle more direction to the player because it can be hard to figure out where to go"

Want to get a turtle and rat to hook up? Go for it. Interested in regicide? Bring some friends. Does the idea of a witch spitting bugs into your mouth get you going? This game has that too.  This is essentially D&D in video-game form.  Do whatever the hell you want to do. If you can think of it, there's probably an option.  If you enjoy fantastic writing and a grand over-arching story, genuinely compelling characters, a complex and terribly fun combat system, as well as a great balance of seriousness and humour, pick this goddamn game up immediately.

Big Daddy BeefDick,82,1,0,March 2,Recommended,263.6,"Fantastic Game if you're into RPGs. They took Divinity Original Sin and made it better it most aspects. The game is engaging all the way through and provides hours upon hours of game play with different ways of getting things done. The new restructure of Stats and Abilities makes you feel alot more in line with where you should be compared to other creatures of your level without feeling broken.   They simplified the way a lot of things work and the only one that irked me was Crafting. Crafting in Divinity Original Sin and Enhanced Edition really brought a lot to the game with money making and being able to stack resistances to make up for lower end gear that you just couldn't find an Upgrade for. In Divinity Sin Original Sin 2 you can forget about that and weapon enchants are down to just Two methods. Poison Barrel or an Eternal Object for Lightning. Poison Barrel adds Poison damage which honestly hurts for a ton of fights where you're partially healing the creature you're damaging(Undead).  The Dev Team is great, even after being released as a full game for this long they are still pumping out Bug Fix Patches and Game Balance Patches which shows they care about the Game and what the Community thinks.  I'd give this game an 8/10, Larian Studios really knows what they're doing."
Seppy,89,1,0,March 2,Recommended,56.4,"Total: 9.8/10  Here's my review    Customization/Progress 9.8 Customize things like: Appearance, Attributes, Abilites, Skills, Talents, Tags and your battle music whenever you kill an enemy. Every small upgrade you choose makes a big difference. Its a little poor when it comes to the face/hair customization but the other things makes up for it    Gameplay 9.8 Gameplay is smooth and feels immersive. Especially the dialogues and the impact it can have in most cases. The turn-based action gives you alot of time to think for the right moves and it's a game where you can relax and not just button mash your way through like Diablo. The ability to play with your friend(s) through the game is also very enticing. The reason I took away 0.2 of the score is because it can be quite confusing for newbies to find out what to do (especially if you haven't played Divinity 1 before)    Graphics 9.9 Suprisingly good graphics even up-close, but the ""Deathfog"" is annoying to watch while the camera is moving which is why I took away 0.1 score. Fortunately you won't see too much of it   Optimization 10 Very good optimization, with ""High"" settings I don't even notice frame drops in fights with alot of things going on.  Specs:  Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4690k CPU @ 3.50GHz 16 GB DDR4 Ram which isn't even insanely good specs either.  "

Big times!  Original Sin 2 is a proper old timey isometric turn-based RPG game, with instantly nostalgiafied music and characters, at least for me.  Around 200 hours played, went through it twice and loved it both times.  This was an instant classic for me so I'll have to give it 7,5 Godwoken out of 10. Cheerio!"

There are some quest markers on the map but not for all quests. Basically if you enjoy a ton of exploring this game is for you. Personally I like my quests to be more laid out, it's just a choice thing. ~I also find the game fights to be very challenging, but also overly reliant on the game wanting you to use elemental combos. Trying to beat down an oppenent that is not weak to a certain element or combo just will not work. But using rain then hail, or oil then fire, or rain then electric = easy fight.  If I rated this I would give it a 7/10. If the questing was a tad easier/laid out more clearly it would be a 10/10 for me. Again that is just a personal choice with RPG type games. For sure a buy.  **Edit** Need to patch a few bugs I have found. The main one being the quest journal not updating."

I went into this thinking it was just a generic diablo clone (which I like) and instead got something with the depth and freedom of the first two fallout games and the writing of an HBO series. All the characters are vibrant and lively, and even with a custom character you can find yourself playing exactly the personality you want to play with how varied the choices are. I hope other companies take note -- this is the sort of RPG and storytelling people are after in open world games."
sonofabelll,78,1,0,"November 17, 2017",Recommended,213.6,"Where does one begin? I do my homework about games, and I rarely rarely rarely pre-order anything ever. This game. This game has everything correct about gaming. This game has everthing correct about having fun. This game reminds me of the days where I enjoyed the story, not just the 10-second thrill you get after grinding for 2 weeks for a better weapon. This game took me back to my first play throughs of ocarina of time, of donkey kong, and of knights of the old republic. The combat in those games were great, but the story is what made them legends.  Okay, so to make sense of everything I just wrote... Whatever you think you can do, chances are you can do it. Whatever you think you can't do, chances are you can do that too. For example, a mop bucket? OR A PROTECTIVE HELMET! Doing a sidequest to get a key to unlock the door? OR JUST SAY NUH-UH AND TELEPORT A GUY THROUGH THE GATE TO STEAL THE KEY FROM THE GUARDS AND THEN LET EVERYONE ELSE THROUGH BUT THAT RAISES THE ALARM SO NOW YOU HAVE TO BATTLE YOUR WAY OUT BECAUSE THE DUMBASS LIZZARD ISNT SNEAKY! Is that a weird black cat following you? OR THE MYSTIC BLACK WIZARD CAT THAT CAN TELEPORT YOU TO PLACES!  The game has so much content, and it intentionally bars you from about 1/3 of it due to party member limitations. The sheer amount of interaction my character has with the rest of the NPC's throughout the game and how it has shaped my path is amazing. The replayability is amazing...................oh yeah and I'm still in the first zone and I can say all that.  If you were wondering what you should do with that time off this holiday season, forget the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t EA is doing and buy this game."

It took me 100 hours to complete the game in Tactician mode and to clear Lohse's and Red Lobster's (uh, I mean the Red Prince) stories. I'm planning to restart the journey in HONOUR mode during the Thanksgiving break....   The battles are challenging (sometimes painstaking in Tactician mode) but almost all of them are well-designed.  I need to spend a lot of time making the strategy for each one, which as a result makes the victory more encouraging.  For me, a non-native speaker of English, the obstacles are some esoteric words. Hopefully in the enhanced version offical Chinese subtitles could be added.   P.S. I also got the DLC. The OST is awsome, so as the artbooks!"

Galahad,324,1,0,January 6,Recommended,272.0,"Games like this are what make me appreciate video games. This game has it all and is so well constructed. Larian has outdone themselves here and I can not recommend this game enough.  Some selling points:  -Deep strategic combat possibilities which feel amazing to master. Not only that, but the battlefields are usually constructed to allow for many approaches to combat. Status effects, different types of armor, and a myriad of skills and abilities means hundreds of ways to design a character and a vast amount of unique ways to approach combat.   - Flexible character customization possibilities. The game doesn't lock you in or punish you for not optimizing your character construction, instead it allows you to respec after you gain a deeper understandning of how everything works.   - Extremely pleasing aesthetically. Th terrain, art, armor  and weapon design, all beautiful. I enjoy just walking around in the game not even doing anything.  - Gripping and Engaging Atmosphere. The game pulls you in and contains realistic elements that make it's world fantastical but also believable. People actually notice when you steal something from them. They notice when you have a fight in the backroom of a tavern and forget to close the door.  - Interesting Origin Characters with their own stories but also the option to forge your own character in that world.  - Vast amount of things to do, places to see, secrets to find, enemies to kill. This game is huge and only costs 45 dollars. That alone makes it an alluring investment.  Downsides:  - some bugs, glitches. I've found these are very minor and usually solveable. Journal wasn't working, restarted game, fixed. Helmet stopped displaying on character, didn't care didn't like that helmet anyway. Larian clearly cares about this game and I think they will continue perfecting it.  - Learning Curve. I will say the game is a complex one to master and at first looking through all the skills, stats, terrains, items, etc. you can feel a bit lost. So it requires some patience. I found the complexity enjoyable but others may not.  Really I think this game is the definition of adventure, I've loved every minute going on quests, exploring, and feeling like I'm not sitting in front of a computer. It's blissful escapism and exactly what you want from a fantasy adventure game.  To anyone from Larian that reads this: thank you very much for your work and what you've created. It's a masterpiece and a fine example of what is possible when games are taken to their highest level. You should be proud."

Goose,277,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,161.1,"To say that this is a great game, actually does it a disservice, it is a phenomenally made game with amazing RPG elements and spot on tactical gameplay.   At first I thought the game was a bit overbalanced on the NPC's side,  but ended up finding out that it was just me.  A few key gear purchases and suddenly I was taking out fights that I had an incredibly difficult time before.  The combat does a great job of making you feel powerful while never making it feel easy.  Your tactics matter.  From your choices of companions (and what specializations they have) to the positioning on the battlefield, to trying to create your own ambush instead of getting ambushed is just amazingly done.  The game does not hand hold you along, but at the same time it does not feel hard to keep up with all the different quests and side missions that you have on your plate.  Not every fight is meant to be tackled the first time you see it and the game rewards you for taking out something in an ingenious way with an every increasing power level on your gear.  You are always advancing in one way or another.  I never write reviews, this is probably my first so hopefully that says something.  Such an amazing game, do yourself a favor and buy this!"

I then snuck in my rogue and back stabbed one of the archers (and turned him into a chicken). Next came my wayfarer, using fossil strike and a fire arrow I blocked the enemy from approaching my backline. Afterwards my summoner made a bunch of creatures. Poison, explosions and madness ensued  While all this was happening the boss was still casually talking, replying to my threat 'That's cute.' with a rogue behind him, 4 summons next to him and a wayfarers crossbow aimed at his skull.

marklane212,48,1,0,"December 4, 2017",Recommended,89.0,"9.5/10 The only thing that this game needs is more content. The story is incedibly immersive and the character creation and development is 2nd to none.  NEW PLAYER ADVICE/TUTORIAL If your starting divinity as a new player, heres some advice before you start running into the game head-on thinking this is skyrim; as you will add to the list of players claiming this game is way too hard on classic mode...   No spoilers here btw.  STARTING THE GAME At the very start of the game you are asked to create your character (sorry, spoiler!). DO NOT RUSH THIS PART OF THE GAME. Before you even look at building a class, or rushing into the game, the classes in the game develop over the course of the game, so your playstyle with said character will also change. This game is very slow and methodical, not unlike a game of chess; you have to plan ahead and think through your actions, there is no timer!  For players that have come from COD, or Diablo etc. this is not hack and slash, so you cant just run in head-on; its like sending your king and queen in to try and kill the pawns as fast as possible. try to think about what will happen each turn, and plan 2 turns ahead.  SAVE OFTEN pretty much self explanatory, but you get jumped a lot, so safe often so that you dont have to retrack the past 10 mins of walking around.  READ EVERYTHING AND SPEAK TO EVERYONE. This is probabally the best piece of information i can supply, and without revealing too much. divinity is about tactics not hack and slash, so speak to as many NPC's as possible and explore every area. this will grant you more experience and access to more items. As the enemies in divinity are all level based, this will allow you to stand on equal footing with them, rather than being 3 levels; wearing a loincloth and wielding a knife on a stick (actual weapon, sorry spoiler!) against a group of 7 decked out enemies all positioned in highground and chokepoints. Also reading enemies weaknesses and levels/armor etc. will help you to control fights better.  YOU DONT HAVE TO GO THAT WAY! Many situations you come up against will look pretty damn scary, especially when you realize the enemies ounumber you, outflank you and outlevel you. This usually means you are underlevelled for the area you are currently in, so go back and complete a few more side quests, or just try taking a different route and coming back to said area (hint, you might not even HAVE to complete that area, but this could mean it holds some good items, and more levels!).  WHAT IF... This is the most important question to be asking yourself during the course of the game, and will mean the difference between winning a fight with 0 Deaths, and losing a fight without killing a single enemy... analyse what you can do, what can happen if you do it, and how your opponent can respond (sorry this is vague, trying not to spoil anything). abuse the terrain and your opponents limitations!  TO CONCLUDE This game is as difficult as you make it, which is why a large group of people find it so difficult, because their game is half complete! turn every area upside down before you move on, as there is probably about 3 quests you missed with 2 levels of xp. And DONT RUSH CHARACTER CREATION! Dont be ashamed if you start a new game after playing for an hour on your first playthrough, i did, because i realised i missed so much and learnt what i was doing wrong. Good luck and take your time!  (spoiler) PS. dont let the cat die...       "
Hexadorus,189,1,0,"December 4, 2017",Recommended,160.7,"I don't write many reviews on Steam, but I just have to say that this is a RPG gem.  The sheer amount of content will keep you occupied for several playthroughs, and the way it handles co-op is exceptional.  Bringing a friend or three along for the ride is so fun, and doesn't feel tacked on; your story will become that much more interesting, and at times hilarious when your friends are calling out for help!  If EA published this game, it would cost you thousands of dollars for this much content, which makes the actual pricetag a steal.  I haven't had this much fun in a top-down Roleplaying game since Baldur's Gate II.  If you're on the fence about buying this game, take it from me that you will be engrossed in the story if you wind up purchasing it.  It does take several hours to get into the swing of things, but after that, you won't be able to put it down."

That being said, I've probably played through this game like 6 times so far and not only is it still so fun, I'm pretty certain there are still things I have yet to see! The game is amazing as is, but the mods really let you take it to the next level.  Already, there are mods for crafting, combat balancing, new spells/items, and a host of other really cool/enriching elements that can be added.  I love to browse the workshop to see how I can spice up my next play through.  I'm more of a single-player person and so I haven't tried playing this game online, but I imagine if you enjoyed multiplayer then there will be 100s of more hours of quality gaming to be found with D:OS 2.

yvesp,67,1,0,"December 26, 2017",Recommended,375.6,"Larian turned gold to lead, but this game is probably worth it, provided that you know what you do.  First off, choose wisely your play level. I chose tactician as a veteran of RPG. I was well served. Indeed, tactician it is! But it doesn't say that you should also scratch every single little advantage that you can (steal as much as possible, stack on potions etc.) in order to be well prepared for the last fight. It also doesn't say that you shouldn't expect your characters to be heroic! Indeed, in many situations at that level you will have to resort to cheesy tactics such as some characters fleeing the combat to recover skill timers, heal, then come back while the combat has been frozen because you left one character or invocation hold it... Or by reloading consistently because you were not prepared for a nasty surprise in a combat and had nothing left to deal with it; so you reload, come back with smart prepositionning and the combat will go smoothly. I remember a fight against some outrageous horror -helped by numerous cronies, all of them more powerful than my characters despite being one level above-, which I easily lost head to head, then won after reloading, placing my characters far enough, engaging with invocations and keeping my characters far enough -actually out of combat- that I could always cast a new invocation when one died. I finally won that fight without a scratch. Smart ? sure. Pleasurable ? Hardly.  So unless you like going very slowly, always moving like there is a fight at the next step (or reloading often), managing inventories to be sure each character has the absolute best equipment, has the necessary consumables,  and so on (i.e. total micromanagement), skip the tactician level. At normal level, the game is going to be challenging enough for most players. Especially the last combat, which I never finished -I have done quite well in the first part, but am hopelessly outnumbered in the second part. I probably know what is wrong, but I won't be going back batching the potions that I am missing, respecing my characters to more useful stats, traits and spells, changing runes for more useful ones etc. you get the picture for tactician level.- So, I won't know the end of the story line I chose, and I won't change my storyline just so the last combat is easier. That's a bit sad.  And NO: YOU CANNO'T CHANGE THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL DOWN! That's a real shame!  Also, there is no excuse for larian in turning an excellent character development/combat system into the mediocre thing that it has become. In that respect, Original Sin 1 was way better. The current system has clearly been designed in order to foil the player and outrageously favor the opponents. You cannot inflict secondary effects (blinding, stunned etc.) as long as the target has magical or physical armor (a new protection that comes above your hit points.) This means that the first rounds of combat are always going to be damage dealing: you won't have any crowd control coming until you've done some attrition first. Worse: the system favors teams which choose a damage type and stick to it. I made the mistake of wanting a balanced party: the result is that I am too weak for the last fight. Actually in some fights, I had characters standing aside, watching the combat go because they did not deal the right kind of damage...  After all this has been said, I still recommend this game because the story looks good, the world is well developped and generally speakig as RPG go, it stands on the top if you don't fall into the trap where I fell.  EDIT: I finally found the courage to do what I said I wouldn't do, and of course finish the game. As expected, I had to respec my characters, and decided to go for lone wolf. The advantage in lone wolf lies not in the power of the characters (they indeed are stronger, but you have overall less firepower), but in the fact that you don't have to bother about the survival or such and such character, as well as reducing the drain on your consumables (you use two instead of four for a similar effect.) The fight was easy [SPOILERS (light) AHEAD] mostly for use of the special tea sold by Mrs Kremm, combined with at least +50% full elemental protection potions and five star dinner -i.e. all elemental damage did heal me, which both let me remove most healing spells as well as use my own offensive spells for healing-, the pawn and duck duck goose (for good movement, not mentioning spells.) Other talents which I thought would help did not (guerilla) [END SPOILERS] ; I changed my main character from pure mage to hybrid melee (fighter) / mage, helped by an archer/assassin ; as explained above, this was a choice to favor physical damage over magical damage, choice made necessary by the difficulty of that fight. I of course had to spend considerable time to prepare the characters and the consumables, buy or craft the required potions and books as well as redistribute equipment. The trouble is that in that fight I did not recognize the character(s) I played consistently from the beginning (no respec before the end), which is annying (to say the least) for a RPG! The other trouble is of course that I could not have to feeling that the hero was well above the other contenders to deserve my victory. Indeed, the stats of all other human opponents were consistently above those of the hero. Understand who can!"
Nekomatagirl,108,1,0,September 4,Recommended,117.0,"--No spoilers--  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a game that at first kind of looks meh. The graphics might not appeal to some and others might find the spells and other things clunky at first. But the game is rather quite the opposite of those problems. It's a great game but a game you need to get invested into. I enjoy the combat greatly because there is so much to do and so much to interact with. I also really enjoy sidequests and this game has a ton of them. There is a lot to explore and discover.  At the time of writing this I have about 116 hours and still haven't completed the game. Do not think that it tastes that long to finish a campaign, but merely there is a lot to look and do. One of the problems of the game isn't even the game's fault. It is the players. Some people drop games or get to busy to continue.  I've restarted the main campaign about a dozen times (sometimes my fault) before finding someone that would go all the way. But it really is a blast when you are with a friend or friends.  Though I must say the crafting system is kind of lackluster when it comes to anything but potion making. I barely use it unless it's to make potions. Some places are annoying to deal with and that one battle with oil slugs or whatever they were called didn't do my computer any good. Loading screens are longish but you barely have to do any load screens at all because the entire map is just available to you. The dialogue and narrator are also one of my favorite parts of the game.   Overall? I recommend it highly! It's absolutely worth it."

You'll want to replay this game with new character ideas or to test your knowledge of the game in tactican or honour mode. But if I thought DOS1 was brilliant and needed changes, then I must admit I feel the same way about DOS2. My main issue being that the combat system filters you to certain ways of playing which DOS1 did too but DOS2 does in different ways. Party of 4? Stick to either physical or magical damage focus for all, as mixing stats makes both weak or one side essentially useless (but doable on explorer mode). Party of 1 or 2? Hit that Lone Wolf talent on character creation and you'll have the most fun the game can give. To an extent you can mix damage skills quite well and not have a bad character.   With that said, you'll have many hours of fun making characters that work and even those that don't (which you can thankfully fix after act 1)."

Buddytiger,115,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,192.4,"Divinity: original sin 2 is my first game in the Divinity series, and I bought it following the overwhelming number of glowing reviews everywhere, including from friends. So I am now unabashedly jumping on the bandwagon, writing that the game deserves every praises and accolades showered its way.  As a computer role playing games veteran, I played its spiritual ancestors, the likes of ""Baldur's gate"", ""Neverwinter"", ""Planescape: Torment"" and ""Arcanum"", and I can say that I am feeling right at home with Divinity: Original sin 2. It feels and plays the same but not quite, with the improvements in technology providing luscious sceneries and sumptuous special effects, all the while with great sounds, voices and a haunting music.   The combats can be made as difficult as one wants, and there is a whole world to explore with its mechanics and secrets. Spells and environments combos are there for the finding (or the googling...). There is very little hand holding but at the same time the game offers many ways to solve its plethora of quests and side stories, and it is designed in such a way that walking off the most obvious path is rewarded ""sometimes"" so it leaves the player wondering whether he should. Compulsive item collectors will have either a field day or nightmares trying to keep track of everything, and new dialogues will open up depending on which character speaks or takes the action.  So if you feel like going on a great adventure, alone or with friends, grab the game, then your sword, staff or wand, and be prepared for the journey of a lifetime (or two, or three..)."

Some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a game, really can't recommend this enough.  Be aware that the gameplay, whilst I personally think is great, may not be for everyone, so watch some videos if you're not sure. 10/10 would love to see this as GOTY. "
VonKlaus,357,1,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,100.5,"Wow.  I just finished my first full playthrough and this is easily the best game I have played this year.  It took me 67 hours at a moderate to slow pace and I was mainly of the first 2 difficulty modes.  The only real negative that I have is that I wished they had kept more of the weapon and armor upgrading from the first game.  That said, the runes you can add to items do help fill that role.  Well done Larian on such a fantastic expierence!"
Thunderface,77,1,0,May 12,Recommended,162.4,"it's simply the best  ISO-rpg out there. And unlike most of them, it has a great story, voice acting, and world all combined. I never felt the best combination of those things since planescape torment or Diablo II. The gameplay is deep and thought provoking. And the ability to manipulate the evironment is second to none.   The game ALMOST falls into the 'you are the chosen one' trope (like the first one) but does a clever twist on it towards the end. The pacing can be tough, and the story can be fragmented  - but that is the nature of a real 'choose your own adventure'. The begining animated sequence is a little add as well. It was better in the alpha when it just immersed you in the world straight away.   Fane (the skeleton) and Izban (soldier) are by far the best voice actors and background stories."

Micblayo,263,1,0,"November 19, 2017",Recommended,3.9,"1 hour in, and I already love this game.  You can tell they put a ton of effort into making every step a smooth experience. There is a ton of polish. And the world building is fantastic. I feel like I'm reading a LOTR series, except I get to take part in the events. There are kings and queens and emperors, and monsters and villains and heros and gods, and things going on over here and over there while I'm doing my thing.  Most current RPGs make it really hard for me to imagine myself as taking part in the story. For DOS2, it takes almost no effort. I really want to know what happened to my characters ancestors, and what my friend wants to do, and what their family is doing, etc. I can make decisions based on how I would react in each situation.  And on top of all of that, they have coop too! Like WTF, they don't know when to stop!  It really feels like a labor of love. For what you get, this game is wayyy undervalued - I'd be willing to pay at least $80 for all of these features."

Faux Dog,222,1,0,January 11,Recommended,312.3,"Probably one of the best strategy RPG games I've ever stumbled across. I bought the game back during it's EA, before a lot of the current content was around since it was cheaper then. However, finally taking the time to play it has shown me it was worth waiting for.  Fights all require a lot of strategy, I always end up challenging myself on SP by having no companions. I sometimes get cheesed out in fights, but have always re-tried with different tactics in order to overcome what was presented to me.  There's a lot of side quests and fights to help you level up if you find yourself behind in a particular location.  tl;dr +Good combat system. +Character respecs allow you to change your character if you're not liking your build. +Looks and feels fantastic as games go. +Music is awesome, instrument choice isn't used in every track, but combat incorperates it.  =Loot everything, never know where a good item will generate.  -Some fights will cheese you to death if you play solo like myself(So not inherent fault of the game.) -Saving can take a very long time if you've interacted with all the objects(Again, probably mt own fault.)"

As is, at the time of writing this review, Divinity has come the furthest amongst its RPG peers in reaching a new degree of freedom and player agency. The amount of effort put in by Larian Studios often breaks the fourth wall and smacks you in the face from behind the monitor. It is just that obvious.

You can make your character how you want OR play through as one of the prebuilt characters.

I have played quite a few Divinity games, Divinity I, Divinity I Enhanced, and now this one. sadly, I have not beaten Divinity one just yet...becasue this game has ensnared me it it's beautiful artwork, charecter classes, and story. In this game, Divinity one is turned around as you now play a sorceurer, the 'bad guys' from the first game.   As expected, the combat is tougher than the first since you start with the bare minimum. You can't run in swinging on the first Island, it takes quite a while before you reach the 'run and gun' stage of blowing away the compition. hell, I was wrecked by some silent monks because a spell went a little crazy.   The Island rquiers you to play smart...very smart. you need to watch everything and make sure you are not standing in water before you electrocute it. you have to look for archers hidding in the bushes. You have to heed the warning of 'don't break this jar or something bad will happen to you' (That something bad being five skeletons showing up an wrecking your face)  In short, the game is difficult if you are reckless. A single wrong click will screw you faster than a missed swing in Dark Souls. I recommend saving often and having a backup file just in case. the Island will trap you, and It will kill you. You have little hope of succsess... Welcome to Rivalon.   now, some positives and negatives: PRO: -Voice acting. Totaly worth it -stratagy to make my brain hurt -A litteral TON of loot -dark humor in a dark game that I shouldn't have found so funny. -steal EVERYTHING!....then die -Super Rewarding when you reach that point where you can actually fight, insted of flail and hope you hit. -A actual story, something that I miss in many of the other games I play, complet with plot, conflict, and a resolution...if I ever get there.   CON: -The mouse can be very picky when you click, and will not hesitate to f**k you over. It can be a real rage feast when you try to shoot an arrow, but insted you walk next to the guy with a sword bigger than you. -The Price. I got this a while ago when it was in development and I had the money. After playing Divinity one, I scooped this game up fast. If you are on the fence about the game, wait until it goes on sale. This game is totally worth the price to me, but I knew what I was getting into. 20/10"

Del,147,1,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,181.5,The most enthralling RPG I have played in years. Improves upon the original in every way concievable. The game encourages you to cheat and break it in any way possible and never skips a beat because of it. There are endless permutations of party compositions and this is one of the few RPGs where just about any character you could make is viable (unless you want to mix bows/daggers/spears with swords also spears suck don't use them even though you want to)  -A person who hates turn based combat
DASUltima,316,1,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,155.4,"This game is a masterpiece, plain and simple.  I highly recommend it to all those remotely interested.  Coming from somebody who had not finished the original due to several factors, including; messy story-line and general boredom from the odd pacing set in the game, I can wholeheartedly say that this game vastly improved upon the original's flaws and then some.  The player comes for the game-play (advertised as no rules sandbox of sorts), and stays for the story (which kicks off rather nicely). And truly what magnificent game-play and storytelling it is. The adventure is told through both ""Origin"" characters and an unique ""tag"" system that allows the player to select titles of sorts that give additional dialogue options. Pretty neat stuff.  There is never a dull moment to this game as it is stuffed to the brim with content. Over 120 hours played and I still don't want to put it down. Adding mods to the equation just adds more and more replay-ability.  Granted while the difficulty can be rather steep for some, and having beaten it on ""Honour Mode"" (Ironman on steroids), I can say with certainty that truly enjoying the game requires both and open mind and a knack for the unconventional.  Thank you Larian, for easily the best experience the past several years.  Tldr: Play, Love, Kickstart Divinity Original Sin 3"
Suq Madiq,171,1,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,109.3,"The game is alot of fun and i have had a great time in it, so far the only and biggest complaint is how buggy the quest journal is and just ignores updates through the game.  Hopefully this will get a fix or a mod to sort it out."
Luke,178,1,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,137.4,"If you are rather a action oriented player you won't like this game but it is a must have for rpg fans who like slow, turn-based combat. Plenty of (well narrated) quests will keep you busy for many hours. The character development and skill system is also interesting since it provides to opportunity to try out different approaches to gameplay and combat. What I also like is the fact that the higher difficulty levels are definitely challenging and require some planning before engaging in combat.  However, the complexity might too challenging for people how want to have some quick fun. You will need some time to get used to all the options that you have.  Camera movement is also a bit annoying in my opinion ... but maybe I am too clumsy. Many people also seem to have experienced save game bugs, which is of course a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥and should not happen after release.   All in all, I definitely recommend buying the game but be aware of possible save game bugs. Hopefully, good sales will result in more games of that quality."

LouskRad,"3,694",1,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,165.8,"Simply amazing.   In terms of strorytelling, this rpg provides an immersive experience with a story you won't guess from the first gameplay hour. It's epic and it's character dependent (to a point). The optional pre-made characters enrich this story, even if the player does not play one (they can also be rectuited as party members).  In terms of rpg gameplay dynamics, the potential this game offers for character skill variation can result in absurdly overpowering characters, yet the level progression system somehow compansates; resulting in a feeling of powermonger.  On top of these, all dialogues are voice acted, graphics are beautifully stylized (ne can especially find the richly colorful style goes quite interesting with story) and the game camera works wonders.  As a result, I was quite happy that I backed this game and it was honestly better than I expected."

You also need to pay attention to what's going on, as with the original there is almost no hand holding in classic mode. I my case this lead to me falling back into old habbits and killing everyone that looked at me funny. Due to what appears to be an increased aggro range this has lead to most of the camp now being used to grit the path when it gets icey (i'm guessing this will come back to bite me, but it's fun anyways).

Definetely worth every penny even if you buy it for the full price.  I don't believe there are any other RPG out there that makes the class system so obsolete. You can play with your character any way you like, literally.. Wanna play a melee pyromancer mage? An elementalist who controls every element? A baddass ranger who is also a dual wielding rogue? A Warrior with a big♥♥♥♥♥weapon who flies (yes, with wings) around the battlefield while shooting laser rays out of his/her♥♥♥♥♥ Go ahead, no one is stopping you. Your own imagination is the only limit in this case.  Multiplayer is also fun, nothing beats when your friend uses a poison bottle (combined with red dye to look like a healing potion) in combat and dies without knowing why or how. You can play with up to 4 players online or even play local co-op if you have 2 controllers.  Also, speaking with animals? PRICELESS! A powerful wizard who happens to be a rooster, known by the name of Magicockorel, teleports you away if you make the mistake of not believing in him and call him a liar. The conversations are so good that I felt like speaking to a dog or a chicken. What else to say?  But to be honest there are some flaws in the game, especially in the inventory management and crafting sections. I wish the developers had implemented some basic UI options like a simple ""search"" bar to ease dealing with the overwhelming components, ingredients and foods that keeps piling up in the inventory page. Minor bugs in quests are also present that sometimes prevents a quest completion.   Nevertheless, it's a GREAT GAME."
Gamrage,86,1,0,May 8,Recommended,384.2,"I'm surprised that I haven't written a review of this game since I first started playing it. This game from my own perspective offers quite a bit.   Story: Every single quest has multiple ways of being approached and there is no system of good or evil. You could be doing good thing for terrible people or bad things for noble causes. You could just be pure evil for the sake of being a jerk, and you could make every kindhearted decision out there. There is no wrong choice and anytime you block a certain path due to a choice you made, there is always another option to be explored.  For the amount of choices that this game gives you in terms of social and story progression, it's worth a full price buy in that alone.  Gameplay: Honestly, there is no such thing as a game without bugs. For all the bugs that this game has, it has a devoted team of developers to constantly patch and repair whatever the community reports to them. For every feature the community asks of the devs, they take everything into careful consideration. The combat mechanics are simple and complex at the same time. Every attack has it's own property, physical or magic. Physical damage has no sub categories while magic damage splits into, fire, water, earth, poison and wind. What makes the magical damage so complex is how the elements interact with each other and the environment to make the gameplay more immersive.   Unfortunately, if you want to play the game for pure optimization and not immersion, most people go into pure physical damage builds to ignore the majority of elemental immunities that certain enemies might have in the game.  To sum it up, the game is great and worth more than it sells for."

Jubi,103,1,0,May 16,Recommended,335.3,"REVIEW UPDATE Adding on some extra thoughts due to the Definitive Edition.   The Definitive Edition takes an amazing game and makes it even better. Performance improvement, glitch fixes, balance changes, a revamped ACT 4 and a lot of quests got extra dialogue to improve flow and better explain objectives. Inventory system and the Journal are much better now.  Nearly every improvement was for the better - the only ones that anyone might be upset about are the exploits that got fixed!   My original review is down below. But in short: The Definitive Edition is an improvement on an already amazing game.     -----ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW-----   Easily one of the best games I've played. You can go at it solo, controlling anywhere from 1 to 4 characters, or team up with friends for up to 4 player co-op.    A rich, beautiful world, memorable NPCs, great story telling and voice acting, fun quests. It's earned every single award it got.  Plus there's so many different ways to play! It has a very tatical aspect to it: building your character up, trying skill combos, moving around the varied battle fields, using mechanics to your advtange, controling the fights through terrain effects. It's challenging, but as you get stronger you actually feel stronger. As you leran more you start finding ways to overcome fights by clever use of mechanics rather than brute force. Of course, the brute force works juts fine!    There's no defined ""class system"" - as you level up you can put your skill points anywhere you want. As you gain more skill points in different areas (like say necromancy or pyromancy) you become more effective with those types of abilities, and can learn stronger abilities in those trees. You can freely respec anytime you want after Act 1, making the only cost to respec being your armor and skill books. This system allows you to try out tons of different builds: and a lot of them work! You're starting class only determines your starting skill points/abilities and weapons you'll get (which will all be replaced quickly). But even then you can customize your class during character creation.  You can go at it with origin characters, characters that have a lot of extra presonal story and quests built into it, or make up your own character! Want to be an undead lizard? Go ahead. Even if you aren't playing an origin character, you can still recruit them as party members to see their stories (but you won't have as much control over it).    It's an amazing game."

[ 狼 ] Wulfee,131,1,0,"September 9, 2017",Recommended,97.9,"I have to say, they really did it this time. If anyone knows how to make a new game whilst improving on it, Larian knows how.  Pros- +Gritty- Honestly the first DOS was a bit too much on the comedy-irony side of the coin, and lacked the emotions I wanted from an rpg. DOS 2 on the otherhand, flipped that and made it a more emotional world where you connect with the people you save (or at least try saving). +Spell combination- Spells combined and formed new wonders in the first game, now it's even better with logical after effects. Stone skin putting out fire and stopping bleeding makes sense, and thats exactly what'll happen here. +Graphics- The graphics have improved, and no longer do people look like cartoonish buffoons living a care free life like in dos 1. Though I do hope they add in more customization to characters, and i'll get to that soon.  Cons- -Character customization- There was barely any in the first game when it came to choices, unfortunately it's the same here. Hopefully with better mod support we can just get it through the workshop. But I have hoping to have a deeper character customization. -Elves- The elveslook very strange indeed, nothing like its counterpart in the opening picture. They seem to have dents or vein lines? or something weird across their body, and look more akin to the avatars (those tall blue folks) than an elf. Maybe thats just how they look in the Divinity universe, but who knows.  So far that was all that I could think of. At this time the game is still in early access so I don't want to criticize the other parts yet, like the lack of portrait pics for npcs or no voices, but till then kudos and cheers."

I can't write one of those hyper-detailed ""very useful"" reviews, but:  1) the entire game is hand crafted with great detail and care. Everything has had a great deal of thoughtful effort put into it.  2) there is a LOT of it. This a long and content-filled game. You can rush through it much faster if you want, or spend time to see it all.  3) graphics are great, actually beautiful, detailed and rich  4) voice acting is top quality, and the game is fully voiced  5) the environment is very open-ended. You can pick up virtually everything. Furniture, barrels full of oil, I'm currently taking a variety of paintings off the walls because I expect some kind of player stronghold later on.

Sargonist,51,1,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,62.8,"Very VERY Good game. Exciting, Story Driven, great customization.. The only thing id say about it, and its NOT a negative, is its VERY HARD. If you create a HERO, and DON'T build him/her correctly & a good mix of party members, you MIGHT find yourself stuck, dying every direction you choose to go the first few hours. In fact you might have to start over a few times. Choices MATTER so MUCH, Saying the WRONG thing to the WRONG person can spell disater VERY quickly. Tread conversations with Most anyone very CAREFULLY. I reccomend researching the kind of build you want and forming a very good party to mix them in with. The Voice acting is INSANE, EVERYONE has a voice, and conversations rarely follow the same route with each different party member.  I only have 10+ hours in this game, but i can tell the REplay value is  going to be great. Another thing, is multiplayer seems to need a little ironing out.. So if youre buying this for Solo, GO FOR IT.. Multiplayer? UNLESS you have  FOR SURE Friend(s) to play with, id hold off on Multiplayer with RANDOMS for now. All in All, id say buy this game ASAP..  its worth every penny..  This is like.. my 2nd review.. so sorry if its lame.

Bürgermeister,140,1,0,"October 11, 2017",Recommended,129.1,"At first I was hesitant at getting this. It looks great, and like a lot of fun, but maybe not worth the price. I thought maybe I'd pick up the game on a sale or something.  But I'm very glad I got it.  The story is very rich and there's so many ways to play. I'm excited for my second and third play throughs.   You can steal from anybody, kill anyone, befriend NPCs, talk to your followers if you choose to have them, and each story is different from character creation. Each race is treated differently, you have different dialogue options if you're an Outlaw, or Scholar, or even if you play a smart Wizard, you can persuade people with your smarts, or intimidate people with your strength.   The combat is very fun, and comboing spells and attacks is awesome.  Classes aren't really set in stone either. If you're a Fighter but decide you want to shock people, or grow some wings, you can very much do so.   And the GM mode is amazing.   As a Game Master for D&D games, I've always wanted a game to play it in, to immerse the players, and let them explore with out having to explain every small detail. And this game does it very well. You can create custom items, NPCs (even down to what hat they wear), allies, and customize the pre set maps the game gives you. I would honestly buy a DLC that includes more maps. But there are plently right now, I'm just afraid that through multiple play throughs we'll all think ""Oh, this map again.""  This game is a masterpiece, but it's not perfect.  The combat is very hard, even on the easiest difficulty it sometimes feels like I need to kill a couple NPCs who don't deserve it so I can level up and continue the story. And sometimes this makes the game feel linear. I don't know if I'm missing something, or I chose bad classes for my party, but either way that's a big down side for me.  That being said, at the time of posting this review I'm 71 hours in, and I havent even completed my first play through, which is a good thing. I'm taking my time, exploring the world, talking to every NPC and living the world.  UPDATE (very minor spoilers):  I finished the game, and I have to say while the ending was good, it was very buggy. I was unable to use res scrolls, enemies would teleport everywhere, and some other minor things.  Arx also felt very bland for what it could have been. Driftwood and all of Reaper's Coast felt huge, and there was so much story there, but Arx... You were there for one thing, and that was to beat the game. I tried to find more to do there, I tried to find side quests, just anything, but there was nothing. Maybe I missed stuff, maybe I didn't. Either way I feel the game no longer deserves my original score of 8.5/10.  8/10"

A coop strategy RPG, with enough customization, depth and variety in character creation and builds to keep you busy for a long time.   After playing around 20 hours I still haven't decided on a build or character that I want to continue on. (I'm very picky) There's so many fun mechanics that it's hard for me to decide.   That being said it's not SCARY depth-filled. If you're casual you can still pick up an easy build and steamroll for the great VOICED story. THEY ACTUALLY VOICED THIS GAME WHAT?!

RC,37,1,0,February 20,Recommended,280.3,"This is the first time I have written a review on steam, and this game made me do it.  I'm playing honour mod, and after some 40 hours, and about 2-3 dead characters, I've succesfully managed to get to level 6 with a very solid party that is looking to become very powerful.   Lore: I haven't played any of the other divinity games, and am completely clueless to the lore. However, the NPCs do a good job of explaining their views on the world, and there's various books you'll find giving you insight on different, relevant subjects. I'm not the guy who usually reads books in rpgs, but in DoS2, so far at least, there's only a couple of pages long at most, with interesting content.  Companions: I instantly got hooked on the potential companions, legit within the first 30 minutes of playing the game and without even being aware they were potential companions. Very unique personalities, well written dialogue, excellent voice acting and actual, interesting backstories. It's so good it's actually difficult to pick who you wanna roll with. In turn though, that adds to the games replayability factor, so that's another plus.  Fane and the Red Prince though, those guys will probably be in all of my campaigns.   Speaking of replayability: You can get crazy inventive on your builds. There is SO much you can do with your talents and skills. Want a traditional DPS Archer? No problem. Death knight wielding necromantic skills, a big♥♥♥♥♥weapon and plate armor destroying the front lines? Sure. Support caster? Fire mage raining hell? Electromancer thundering all over the battlefield? no problem.  Also, skills combo really nicely with each other so not every comp is viable, and on the harder difficulties you don't want to spread too thin (Jack of all trades and master of none will not get you far). You also want to not create anti-synergy. A water/ice wizard will combo extremely well an Electromancer, obviously, but not as well with a fire mage or geomancer.    Strategic layer:  On the honour mod (perma death), this game does an exceptional job of encouraging tactical play and strategic decisions. Xcom2 - Long War on legendary difficulty comes to mind as a comparison, except you don't really have to deal with ridiculous RnG punishing otherwise brilliant play.  Combat: 10/10.   Story: Very engaging and immersive. Also you can do pretty much anything in this game. There's nothing stopping you from walking in the city, guns blazing, and attacking everyone in sight. Well, except from getting killed. So maybe don't do it at level 2.   Quests: Can be finished in a good number of ways. They're unique, they have flavour, are interesting and I have yet to find a single ""Go fetch me 15 of x object"" types of errands, or a quest repeating itself.  Like I said, I haven't played any of the other games and am completely new to this title. And yet this review still reads as if it was written by an avid fanboy. What can I say, it's just that good. For the quality this game offers, honestly, it should cost at least double. Get it. Stuff like this does not happen very often."

ScottaBlast,149,1,0,"December 16, 2017",Recommended,137.0,"Oh boy, where to start?  In the past, I've played the original Divinity, multiple GOTY RPGs such as The Witcher III and Skyrim, along with playing Dungeons and Dragons for years.  After beating this game on classic difficulty, I've realized it is my favorite game of all time, trumping those previously mentioned.  Divinity 2 is the closest I've ever seen a video game get to DnD, near perfectly emulating the freedom of the players.  Notice how I didn't say sense of freedom or illusion of freedom.  Other games try to decieve you into thinking your actions matter, when in all actuality, they make little to no difference.  Here, the game responded multiple times to actions I had done dozens of hours prior.  Not only in simple little references, some had astronomical impacts.  There are also 4 different endings with significant, world-changing differences. You can try to kill anyone, try to steal anything, and have to live with the consequences.  It doesn't hold your hand, and because of that, it makes every decision and discovery you make feel like your own.  Divinity 2 is also a huge step up from the previous game, mainly in terms of overall polish.  The original game was great, however there was an incredibly boring starting zone, poor music, sub par graphics, and nonexistent character in your party.  This sequel does what any true sequel does and improves on the old, in nearly every way, while adding new elements.  Upgraded music, graphics, along with the introduction of origin characters with some of the best writing I have ever seen help breathe more and more life into an already thriving world.  The developers also streamlined the combat system while keeping the depth that make it the king of tactical rpgs.    One of the things that stood out to me was how good the story was and told.  With a lot of big, AAA games such as destiny, there is an amazing story, but the delivery is mediocre, turning a great concept into a meh grind.  Here, everyone is fully voice acted well.  You can tell from talking to people in game that this was a labor of love.  The actors poured their hearts and souls into their performance and it really shows.  The story is also brimming with twists and turns that you never see coming, which caused me on occasion to stop in shock, before yelling at the monitor or tearing up.  There is also one origin story character quest (Lohse's) which really hit me hard.  Never have I ever been so happy for a character before.  Then there is the multiplayer.  This game was a full and satisfying package on its own.  But on top of that, they added drop in and drop out multiplayer, so you can experience on of the best games ever with your friends.  There's an arena mode for pure combat.  AND A GM MODE TO CRAFT YOUR OWN GAMES.  This is huge.  The fact that I can run a Pen and Paper RPG for my friends through a medium such as this opens the floodgates to opportunities normally nonexistent if it was just a normal game of DnD.  It also gives people who host online games the option to give their players the  impression of a more living, breathing world.  The only negative aspect of the game I have experienced are the bugs.  They are few and far between, only amounting to a rare crash, or the voice acting not loading or being delayed.  However, Larian studios are hard at work and have been continually sending out patches to address these issues.  Best game I have EVER played.  I finished the game in 85 hours, doing everything I could along the way, and it's not even $60!    10/10  buy  this  NOW!"
DarkOwl,327,1,0,"December 30, 2017",Recommended,87.4,"I dunno. I enjoyed the first Original Sin more. Something about the setting and direction was more enjoyable. I feel that both suffer from the problem of, unless you figure out (or follow guides) to exploit the crap out of things, it's not a game that rewards general play. This will appeal to some people, but if you aren't super interested in deeply understanding its mechanics, it may not be a good experience.  I got to the temple area, I've explored a bit, but I'm kind of bored. I don't want to deal with the slog that combat is, and I don't much care for the plot. Also, every other fight seems to become an entire screen filled with fire (especially the blackpits).  I'd recommend it I guess... but tbh I've kind of just given up on it and don't have the desire to complete it."

On another note; it's truly amazing that these days it takes private funding to make a high quality gem like divinity 2. The big game developers have taken advantage of the gamer community for far too long by releasing crap after crap unfinished indie turds, and pay to play DLC to boot..

I'm in to RPGs like Skyrim, the Witcher, Dragon Age(ish), and fantasy stuff like that. I had always seen this game advertised on steam's front page in recommended for me, but i never took it seriously since it gave me a very ""Diablo 3"" kinda vibe, and that felt too grindy and un-fun for me. But eventually, I finally caved a decided to take a good look at it and felt i should try it out, since I've heard pretty much only good things (see entire review section of this game lmao). Basically, i didn't many expectations starting out.  Holy♥♥♥♥♥♥ This game is good. Like really good. Like REALLY, REALLY good. I did not expect to fall in love as much as I did, nor to ♥♥♥♥ing binge the game and end up earning 80 hours played within a week. I believe a testament to this game's quality is how hard i fell for it, even without playing (or even really knowing about) the first Divinity. It's detailed, it's fun, it has a great story, the gameplay is engaging and does not get dull, and the sheer freedom the player has is incredible. The game's dialouge and overall feel gives me a big DnD vibe. There are many, many branches a dialouge, quests, and the story itself can break off into which will seriously affect how you go forward in the game, even affecting the ending in a very critical way, not the ""good"" or ""bad"" ending bs you normally get from choice-based gameplay like Dishonored or Mass Effect. Moreso, the games gives you more freedom in how you want to build your character, not confining people to class, but rather providing a ""skill level"" you must be leveled up to in order to learn certain abilities, which are all fairly low.  I don't have the ability like other people to give you a long review about every little thing, so I'll leave with this: If you are looking for a fantasy RPG that will reward you with a in-depth experience and let you truly craft your character to be exactly who YOU want them to be, then this is the game for you.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a calibur of game that belongs with the other incredible RPGs like Skyrim or The Witcher 3, and possibly has the potential to surpass them, in my opinion. 11/10 ♥♥♥♥ing fantastic"

I found myself unable to turn away right from the get-go, wanting to turn over every single stone, search every crevice before moving on - and I'm sure there's still plenty of secrets I missed. I had over 12 hours logged before I'd even escaped the fortress for the first time.  The gameplay is engaging, the story compelling, the music enchanting, and the world a true work of beauty. I haven't felt this way about a game since I picked up Dungeon Siege off a Walmart shelf back in the early 00's."

Johnford,414,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,187.2,"Can't stop playing! It's too good! I haven't been this engrossed in a video game since Witcher 3. The various systems of the game are so well crafted, and open up so many possibilities both in terms of combat and how to deal with quests.   The tag system and large dialogue options allow for proper roleplaying. There's a TON of things to do, and none of them are of the ""icon clearing"" variety found in your typical open world GTA/Ubisoft AAA bore.  The writing is very solid, it doesn't take itself too seriously and it's very funny, but deals with serious subjects (racial tension, faith, abuse of power etc...) in a mature way. The music is also seriously underrated.  The graphics are good in terms of the environments, but I guess I'm a not a big fan of the character models. The faces are quite ugly, and the fact that every ""finesse""/rogue armor pieces are baggy pants and sleeves kinda irks me, it doesn't look very light and stealthy. A very minor gripe however, since we don't spend too much times looking are our heroes up close.  I've read that some people have encountered broken quests, and I guess it can be expected at launch given the insane number of them and unlimited possibilities (you can literally kill any NPC, steal any item etc...), but personally the only issue of that kind that I've encountered was just a completed quest (I got the item rewards for it) that didn't clear out from my quest log (The Imprisoned Elf).  I'll just finish by going back to how good and fun the combat is, the interactions between the different elements is a fantastic sandbox to play, and sometimes horribly fail, in. The AI is not exempt from that, I cried laughing last night when an enemy rogue went invisible and promptly revealed himself by falling on his butt after sliding on an ice patch he had created moments before! There are so many builds to be created and ways to approach a fight (including not fighting it at all sometimes, either through dialogue or sneaking/thievery), I can't see myself getting bored anytime soon!  The replayability seems huge as well, since you can have very different questlines depending on who you bring along in your party and who you're playing as your main character.  TLDR:  Fantastic RPG, breathes fresh air into the genre, most fun turn based combat this side of XCom, gives you a ton of freedom and fun with it's system. Serious GOTY contender!  Edited because apparently the word for butt that starts with an A gets censored, by Steam... what?"
deltachi205,175,1,0,"September 20, 2017",Recommended,92.2,First time review here.  Just thought it was time to review a game I enjoyed more than most.  This is honestly my first dive into the hardcore crpg genre and as such I decided to dive in head first.  I have been taking my time to slowly read everything and triple check all areas.  That being said I'm ~20 hours into the game and I'm hooked.  Those 20 hours are over 3 days and I'm still enjoying every second.  Pros:    -Immersive gameplay that introduces you to your party and their backstory  -Voice Acting...simply put EVERY SINGLE LINE is voice acted.  This helped a newcomer like myself really want to hear all the dialogue and enjoy the story unfolding.  -Battle Mechanics...Every battle has a million ways of being approached and with the customization of your party you can take that to even more possibilities   Cons:  Only minor things that are more annoyances than cons...  -Party refuses to walk through status effects outside of combat.  Its nice that they auto walk around these things but the fact that they just won't follow the leader if there is no way around can be frustrating.  -Slower pace out of combat can tend to keep you out of the action longer if you are walking from one side of the map to another.  Nothing major here and honestly I'm reaching to find any cons so far.  TLDR: This is one of the best games I've played in a long timeand I think I've found a new favorite genre.

[RnT]Hank,160,1,0,"November 27, 2017",Recommended,93.7,"78 Hours in, not halfway through 2nd area yet.    Similar to D&D but with its own very unique universe.  Like Baldur's Gate only good.  Pros - Single, Multi, World Builder, DM mode.  Easy, medium, hard and hard +1 save file.  Long game (so far), hard game even on medium.  All NPCs are interactive, all can be killed, most will trade.  All dialogue is voiced, multiplayer dialogue can include input from all players.  Many ways to complete objectives - cleverness is often rewarded.  Looks generic on the surface, but the races are all very unique and a few small changes make for a big difference.  (Example, all elves can eat body parts and gain their memories.  Simple twist, major consequenses.)  Cons - Inventory management is tedious.  Crafting ""discovery"" is stupid, but IMO wikis ruined that for all  games.  There was an instance of me being able to kill and loot the same guy in two different locations on the same campaign - didn't hurt my game much but I guess it was immersion breaking.  There really aren't enough cons here to make a list."

If you are a fan of any sort of role playing game, you will most likely adore this. It feels like a love letter to Baldur's Gate 2, except with great visuals and all of the comforts of modern day games. The music is fantastic, the lore of the world is rich and deep, and the writing and voice acting are among the best I've ever seen. The gameplay and combat itself is spectacular.

strekalalex84,48,1,0,"December 2, 2017",Recommended,201.2,"The mechanics of the game's system is somewhat similar to Pillars of Eternity, in that your character's stats function in terms of percentages and there is a skill system of sorts that you build from 1 and up. It is an open classless system where, while one selects a few options as a baseline at character creation, one is free to invest in any of a full variety of skills over the course of the character progression. However, it does turn out that, at least from an optimization or min/max perspective, maxing the Warfare skill ends up being the default choice for builds that care about damage. There are a few other potential balance issues with the skills, but that's the big one.   The overall combat difficulty in this game seems to be harder than one has probably come to expect from most new RPG's, even on classic mode (the equivolent of the ""normal"" setting), though things can get easier as one learns and exploits the system. But, especially when approaching it on my first playthrough, I too often found myself putting it on story mode (""easy"") to overcome otherwise tough battles. I dislike doing such a thing in an RPG. It feels cheap, But I found myself doing it. The dual physical and magic defense system is simple and functional, though perhaps it is not the most nuanced or fun basis for combat in the way that it works. Combat becomes a matter of destroying enemy defenses in order to leave the enemy vulnerable to taking damage.   There is an attempt to have a little dialogue depth when talking with companions and important NPC's. I would say the dialogue and roleplay involved in it is okay. Nothing super immersive and detailed, nothing like a Torment game or a Dragon Age: Origins, but it's there more than would be the case in a more pure action RPG. There is some choice and consequence based on certain dialogue choices. Your companions have distinct back-stories and personal goals, and stories of their own that can play out over the course of the game. Further, due to the 4 character party limit, there is a little bit of replayability in terms of playing with different companions.   One of the problems with the game is that there simply is not enough explicit direction for the character to be able to follow or complete quests, since there are no quest markers and not much in the way of detail in the journal. Sometimes this is the case in such a way that breaks certain quests because of timing and choice/consequence issues. In and of itself, I don't object to a lack of quest markers or the idea of having the player have to work for things a little. But while it isn't much of an issue in the early game, by the mid to late game I found myself with a journal half filled with unfinished quests simply because I had no clear idea or memory of exactly where the characters I'm supposed to talk to are, or because I had progressed too far doing other quests and missed a vital quest cue or one-shot oppurtunity.   On a 1-10 scale, I'd give it an 8/10."

Some of them may seem uninspired at first, but as you go along they become more and more complex and, for me, more interesting.  -Graphics, soundtrack, visual arts mostly in the right place. Voice acting isn't terrible but some accents are a bit pushed i should say.   -Some good old dungeon crawler humour, mixed with tactical turn based combat gives a unique feeling, which i find awesome.   -Environmental storytelling, crafting and easy-to-comprehend platforming all add up to the fun.  -Enemies are NOT easy so far. I do hope that the game lets you kick some♥♥♥♥♥in the later levels. (In some areas at least)  -User friendly map system and interface.

The goodThere are some good changes to the first game: - you can choose your companion's class when you recruit them - you can respec your character and your companions at almost any time! - if you respec, you don't lose your learned spells/skills - you now have a skill bar with many slots at the bottom of the screen - summoning, hands-down one of the best class in the game; summons can really turn the tides of battles, especially since they can be infused with different elements - full voice acting (I know EE also has that, but the original D:OS didn't)  The so-soThere are also some changes, let's call them neutral; some I've learned to like, while others not so much: - physical and magic armor: you first have to tear through your opponent's armor before you can apply any CC to them; this bothered me a lot at first, when I didn't have the means to get rid of their armors easily, but, as you gain more skills and spells, it becomes less of a problem; there are still some weird things about this system, like you fight an attack dog and it has physical armor for no reason (I mean, I understand when a human enemy has physical armor because he has a breastplate, but a naked dog?) - you have to spend skill points on Memory, which increases your skill slots; I didn't like this at first, because I'd want to spend my points on other attributes; however, it isn't as bad, as you receive free Memory slots when leveling up at certain levels - Source Points; I still don't like this mechanic as some of the best abilities are now locked behind the need of source; these good abilities already had the disadvantage of using more than 1 Memory Slot, but you also need Source to cast them; of course, you can steal source from enemies or corpses, but enemies can also steal you source - a bit of spoiler ahead: the companions that are not in your party at the end of the first area will die, so you cannot see their storyline for the remainder of that playthrough; in my opinion, this is horrible game design, but I guess it helps with replayability - your party members can leave you permanently late in the game, depending on dialog choices, even though you had a good relationship with them (high attitude) until then; I was shocked when this happened, because I don't understand what the point of companion attitude is - new game modes: PvP and Game Master; I haven't tried these yet, so I don't know if they're good, but they're there - it also comes with a free Map Editor  The badThe game also has some bad parts, of course: - I didn't play it when it launched because I was sure there were going to be bugs. I've waited for a week or two and a few patches and played it without major technical issues (though I did have a 100% crash in an area that had a lot of lava around, but lowering the graphical settings resolved that). - on the gameplay side, as many have pointed out, the last part (Arx) isn't as good as the rest of the game, but it's not really that bad. There are some weird fights with respawning enemies in a certain embassy, but those can be avoided by sneaking. P.S.: When writing this review, I'm just before the last fight, so I'm not sure what that's like.  The uglyRed Prince and the lizard kin. They're ugly AF.  VerdictThis is a must buy for any gamer who likes party-based RPGs."

₭r⊙п6∆cᚻ,293,1,0,"November 25, 2017",Recommended,86.6,"This is an absolute gem. It is absolutely incredible. The graphics, the story, the gameplay, the comedy, you name it. I typically find top down cRPGs rather boring but this is definitely one of the top 10 games I have ever played. Time will tell where it lands but it is incredibly good.  There are plenty of full reviews out there so read those if you want a general review. Here is what I specifically like about it: Larian loves its players and it shows.  They really do. In DOS2, you can customize this game to make it the game you want to play. For example, I am not a hardcore CRPG guy. I like a more casual experience and I also want to play this with my partner, preferably without having to cash out for a second copy. While that might be difficult for most games in the genre, DOS2 lets us set the difficult to Explorer (which feels perfectly balanced for us) and play coop in split screen. It also allowed us to redo our builds after the first act so that any mistakes made could be adjusted without having to start over again. It also autosaves plenty, so we could easily recover from any mistake.  I could easily see how I could play DOS2 by myself and love that too. Or to play it with 3 friends who really love hardcore games. In fact, this is the closest any videogame has ever come to being a tabletop pen and paper roleplaying game IMHO.  Can't wait for DOS3."

Seemingly endless character options and abilities beg for replay and the inclusion of complex generated characters to role play only make the emersion more delightful. Excellent voice acting and compelling storyline makes this one of the best RPG games I have ever played. Diferent difficuty modes allows for a more casual approach to combat in the easy mode to forcing you to really think how your battle will play out in the hardest mode which does not allow reloading a saved game if all your group dies.  This game hits all the marks and exceeds them. No serious bugs. Appropriate rewards. Meaningful crafting and colorful, tactical game play that rewards thinkers and not point and click mindless fighting. Elements interact and affect combat.  I can't recommend this game enough."

marklane212,48,1,0,"December 4, 2017",Recommended,89.0,"9.5/10 The only thing that this game needs is more content. The story is incedibly immersive and the character creation and development is 2nd to none.  NEW PLAYER ADVICE/TUTORIAL If your starting divinity as a new player, heres some advice before you start running into the game head-on thinking this is skyrim; as you will add to the list of players claiming this game is way too hard on classic mode...   No spoilers here btw.  STARTING THE GAME At the very start of the game you are asked to create your character (sorry, spoiler!). DO NOT RUSH THIS PART OF THE GAME. Before you even look at building a class, or rushing into the game, the classes in the game develop over the course of the game, so your playstyle with said character will also change. This game is very slow and methodical, not unlike a game of chess; you have to plan ahead and think through your actions, there is no timer!  For players that have come from COD, or Diablo etc. this is not hack and slash, so you cant just run in head-on; its like sending your king and queen in to try and kill the pawns as fast as possible. try to think about what will happen each turn, and plan 2 turns ahead.  SAVE OFTEN pretty much self explanatory, but you get jumped a lot, so safe often so that you dont have to retrack the past 10 mins of walking around.  READ EVERYTHING AND SPEAK TO EVERYONE. This is probabally the best piece of information i can supply, and without revealing too much. divinity is about tactics not hack and slash, so speak to as many NPC's as possible and explore every area. this will grant you more experience and access to more items. As the enemies in divinity are all level based, this will allow you to stand on equal footing with them, rather than being 3 levels; wearing a loincloth and wielding a knife on a stick (actual weapon, sorry spoiler!) against a group of 7 decked out enemies all positioned in highground and chokepoints. Also reading enemies weaknesses and levels/armor etc. will help you to control fights better.  YOU DONT HAVE TO GO THAT WAY! Many situations you come up against will look pretty damn scary, especially when you realize the enemies ounumber you, outflank you and outlevel you. This usually means you are underlevelled for the area you are currently in, so go back and complete a few more side quests, or just try taking a different route and coming back to said area (hint, you might not even HAVE to complete that area, but this could mean it holds some good items, and more levels!).  WHAT IF... This is the most important question to be asking yourself during the course of the game, and will mean the difference between winning a fight with 0 Deaths, and losing a fight without killing a single enemy... analyse what you can do, what can happen if you do it, and how your opponent can respond (sorry this is vague, trying not to spoil anything). abuse the terrain and your opponents limitations!  TO CONCLUDE This game is as difficult as you make it, which is why a large group of people find it so difficult, because their game is half complete! turn every area upside down before you move on, as there is probably about 3 quests you missed with 2 levels of xp. And DONT RUSH CHARACTER CREATION! Dont be ashamed if you start a new game after playing for an hour on your first playthrough, i did, because i realised i missed so much and learnt what i was doing wrong. Good luck and take your time!  (spoiler) PS. dont let the cat die...       "
Hexadorus,189,1,0,"December 4, 2017",Recommended,160.7,"I don't write many reviews on Steam, but I just have to say that this is a RPG gem.  The sheer amount of content will keep you occupied for several playthroughs, and the way it handles co-op is exceptional.  Bringing a friend or three along for the ride is so fun, and doesn't feel tacked on; your story will become that much more interesting, and at times hilarious when your friends are calling out for help!  If EA published this game, it would cost you thousands of dollars for this much content, which makes the actual pricetag a steal.  I haven't had this much fun in a top-down Roleplaying game since Baldur's Gate II.  If you're on the fence about buying this game, take it from me that you will be engrossed in the story if you wind up purchasing it.  It does take several hours to get into the swing of things, but after that, you won't be able to put it down."

I look back with solem regret I didn't buy this game long before finals. It's in our moments of stress and weakness we look to games to distract us from our hobbies. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is not just a distraction. Assuming it was just that marked my grade's fate.  It's a masterpiece of a game. A true storybook in a sense. It's something that will envelope you into a world of its own and keep you there for hours on end. Should you buy this game? If you're looking for a new hobby that you can invest a couple hundred hours a week into, buy this now. If your schedulle only allows for a few hours here and there, realize you can live off welfare and still buy this game now."
Anon Ymous,68,1,0,October 21,Recommended,118.6,This is the actual game of the year. My only problems with it are that putting too many mods onto standard edition makes targeting act screwy and your hits will sometimes just go through the enemy or actors will act outside of the turn order. I recommend playing with mods that change the armor and cc systems because if you don't you're strongly incentivized to play a party of 4 of the exact same character. This game is great with friends and pretty good alone. 9/10
gosusteele,243,1,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,56.2,"Although I played the original game I never finished it. From what I have played so far, this game resolves a lot of issues I had with the first game. There are so many options that it could easily overwhelm a player that has never played an RPG game such as this one. The game rewards you for experimenting so save constantly and don't be afraid to experiment and explore. The game also reminds me a bit of one of my favorite RPGs Dragon Age: Origins. I highly recommend this game to any RPG and strategy game fan."
Skeletor64,17,1,0,January 2,Recommended,147.9,"This is my first review so I'll keep it ""short"" and try to get to the nitty gritty. I bought this game on a whim after seeing a friend of mine had it on his wishlist and couldn't figure out what to get off the store. I wanted something immersive, with serious replay value becuase I (like most people) don't care to drop $40 to $60 on a game you play for 20 hours and never touch agian. Knowing nothing about this series I went ahead and bought it totally blind to what I was in store for, and I'll go on record saying I have ZERO love in my heart for turn-based combat. This game has literally changed the way I feel about turn-based combat. I have never played a game that literally ran off an element I didn't like and still love to play the game, yet I'm drawn back to this title agian and again. In what time I have played it I've barely scratched the surface and I'm constantly wanting to know more. The world is BEYOND immersive, nearly every single NPC has some quest or bit of lore that you can soak up anytime you want, making you run from NPC to NPC trying to figure out the current task or quest you happen to be focusing on at the time. It is not an easy game, but the drive to learn and lose yourself in this world is so great the challenging combat becomes less about a challenge and more about a the actual world itself. I became less driven about the loot as I normally would and was solely driven by want to know more of the story. No game has done that to me since the original God of War. Basically if you want a game that you can totally lose yourself in, this is THE game for you."

OniRaze,49,1,0,February 10,Recommended,115.4,"Okay, after about 84+ hours into this game, you can assume that I really love this game considering the amount of time I put into it, and you're right. I LOVE THIS GAME. Now, I am not a fan of turn-based rpg's, but this one really made me reconsider. The combat in this game just makes you feel that you need to spend A LOT of time thinking about what your next moves will be because one wrong move can potentially destroy your hopes and dreams of winning the battle. You may think i'm exaggerating, but i'm not. This game really makes you use that thing between your ears. For an indie game, this gem is worth the price.  Lets get down to the pros and cons shall we?  Pros/cons (+/-): +Combat is really good. Makes you think. +ALL of the NPCs are voiced and just doesn't present you with a dialogue box with no one speaking. +Narration is godly +Build according to what you want out of your game. There is no godly class (well, there are some), play what you want. +++Free skill/attribute/talent reset +Amazing soundtrack +The ending(s) depend entirely on what choices you make. +You don't need a full party of 4 to progress. I've seen a lot of players do it solo and it's glorious. +Every map is massive and chock-full of secrets to explore +No loading when fast travelling to waypoints and going in/out of dungeons. +Romance. (There's no gender discrimination either) +Moddable. (check nexus mods for more) +Multiplayer! Play with friends, or play with strangers that could potentially destroy your game. your choice. +Caters to casual and hardcore players alike.   -Could use a little bit more character customization. (Not a lot of options to choose from) -Monsters don't respawn. Therefore, no grinding. :( -Some quests are confusing to complete. (Had to consult the wiki on how to do them) +/-Classic difficulty (aka normal) might come as a shock to new players (like me) considering the massive spike in the learning curve of the game. -Needs more rebalancing. Mages have cooldowns that are too long, Melee classes are too OP.  -Needs more skills -Some skills have a very long animation that makes some fights very long. (yes, im talking to you, source vampirism)  Questions people may ask:  Should I buy this at full price? -YES.  Should I wait for a sale to buy this? -Why would you even do that?  Do I have to be MLG to play this? -Nope. ;)  Overall: 10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! "

Its completely awesome in so many ways. The combat, the lore, the sound effects, the skills, the environment, the score, the voice acting.. just head to toe this game is crafted with every detail taken into consideration.  If offers tons of replay value, a nice variety of characters, and so many ways you can approach fights, dialogue, progression.   Its not a hold you hand game.. there are things you will find and things you will miss. It will frustrate you, it will challenge you, and it will provide you a feeling of satisfaction when you win or turn the tide of a fight. It will make you think, it will make you plan and use tactics, it will make you really work on your team and its synergies.   I've already clocked almost 75 hours and haven't gotten too far into Act 2 before I decided to start over now having a better understanding of the game mechanics (this time playing as a lone wolf build).   There simply are too many things in this game that I like to list off here.. as a long time ARPG player I don't tend to spend much time or money with turn-based RPGs, but this game has changed that standpoint for me big time. Its so well thought out, so well designed and is such an intriguing game. Get lost in Rivellon, go explore, talk to everyone, find all the secret loot and solve its many puzzles.   When you leave a game and realize that you're thinking about it when you're not playing about it quite often, you know that its something special. Haven't felt that way about a game in a while!"

Freddy K,117,1,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,185.4," Rating; 9.8/10  Seriously engrosing gameplay! It's a blackhole that secretly sucks hours and hours until you realise that you spent 20hrs on the first island - and that's not even half the gameplay.  The story is rich, voice acting believeable, and it allows you to make choices - ones that matter, and ones that don't.  But not only that, the choices can be conflicting, it really forces you to think about decisions and consequences.   So actual features that I really enjoyed working with Character choice - kill them/ steal from them/ distract them and loot their home/ story choice/ choose who you want in your party [or none at all]. Combat is both easy and difficult - easy to understand basics, but every fight with my mages, I ended up standing ontop of cursed fire due to some ill-fated mistake I made. Explore! - so much to explore, rewards for exploring, and little tid-bits of joy in every corner Visuals are amazing - with specific areas having different ambient glows/effects, which can be like night/day For example the graveyard is dark and dreary, then you move several metres outside to the green pasture, and it is suddenly happy and chirpy etc.,, I have to wrap up this review, because I just subscribed to new mods for D:OS2, and want to play them, so here we go!  It's worth every cent! I was dubious at first, turnbased RPGs aren't what I would have said 'my thing', story rich games aren't 'my thing', but D:OS2 ties them in so well, that it's entertaining and just works well.  So many small things that this game brings to the table that are worth attention, but alas - you'll have to check those out yourself.  I have one con about this game; it's hard to play 'the bad guy', in the story. You can be a♥♥♥♥♥♥to people, but the core story doesn't have some ultimate evil badguy option, which was a bit dissapointing as my second playthru as a solo-thief/asssasin means I can't take over the world and make everyone my slave.

Connectivity works as intended.  Character movements are fluid although excruciatingly slow when out of combat.   Throughout the world, there can be clutter (lootable/theft-able) items surrounding NPCs you wish to interact with. A ""are you sure you want to steal this item right near the owner because isometric cameras are ridiculous while in a tent"" feature would be nice. Incredibly frustrating to 'load' a previous save file because I clicked a half milimeter to the left of the NPC only to steal his +5 I don't need this cooking pot because I'm overlevled for it; only to be attacked by every person in the same post code.

The game has a fantastic soundtrack and sound effects, the world models and textures work well to expand the world and the way elements of the game interact often leads to fun interactions (or massive explosions)  I found the game can vary in difficulty although this appeared to be due to my own inexpierience. The only issue that I truly had with the game was the large upload once I finished playing (as of 2017).

Nxmzy,180,1,1,September 15,Recommended,72.6,"AHHHHHHHHH where to start. You are thrust into a world of magic without knowing what to do, but you use something called the HUMAN BRAIN to explore and inspect the world around you talking to every detailed and voice acted character, listening to the smooth Chocolaty voice of the narrator. This is your world, this is your land to trade and kill on or that's what I would say if it was an MMO but THIS GAME GOOOD is what I'm trying to hint at.  The Gist - You start out as a prisoner the lowest of the low (kinda, Prisoner might not be the best word for this) and are shipped off to an island for reasons you need to find out by playing the game. You try to escape and meet whatever your goal is. One thing to note is this game does not hold your hand you have to find out what you want to do or what you want to be.  Combat - The game consists of a turned based D&D styled combat where you have your move and initiative whoever has the highest initiative goes first lowest last etc... There are Spells scrolls abilities and more you can also just attack (melee) It can be very action packed at times where you're at your last heath and the enemy misses giving you one last chance ONLY TO MISS AS WELL there are also huge monsters that can kill you almost instantly in not prepared. [combat 9/10] There are just times when it doesn't work as well though  AI - Brain dead at times but it works, and can also be funny. [ AI 7/10 ]  Story - The story is kinda Celica BUT it works how everything molds together and even better for each main quest there are usually about 10 different ways you can do it or you could just skip it all together (this might only be for the first section the skipping part IDK that yet)  Map(s) - There's about 4 of them and they are each with there own story and problems you can choose to fix or simply just kill them all the people (BTW I tested this and yes you can kill every one IKR AMAZING I LOVE KILLING!!!!!) no people no problem. Every map is diverse and different from the last with different looks and settings which only helps the game to feel EVEN MORE ALIVE. (Maps 10/10) They are all ♥♥♥♥ING fantastic love em.  Quest system and shizz - For you to start a quest you must speak to someone who has one right? YAH YEET pick up a sword BOOM you just started a quest pick up a phoenix egg BOOOM you just started.... well I guess ended a quest but hey that's for you to find out. The quest system is pretty regular compared to most quest systems BUT GUESS WHAT there is no back and forth quest EX: Hey you send this letter to queen stupid face so she can send me back and equally useless letter so I can send her back another and another etc... This game Has NON of the thankfully also you can get a quest from animals these Devs were on like weed or something when making this game because some of the quests are AMAZING there was one where I had to kill a chicken. [Quest System and shizz 10/10] amazing overall.  Conclusion - This game is a must buy for D&D players strategy players and also starters it is well optimized and loading is like zipping fast but in some areas, they do throw a lot at you so be wary of that, and if the game is on sale it's even MORE worth it. So it's a Buy. [This Game is a 9/10 With a Badass seal of approval]  Quick shizz:  Cons - Kinda repetitive at times/story can lead you astray in the last part /  Pros - Good combat / Replayable / Great sound design / Awesome music / Good effects or graphics / Gorry / Charm / Fun even if you don't have friends :D (like me ;-; )."

Poor blacksmith decided to start walking as I moved a chest closer in and instantly died :(  So I loaded up here belongings into said chest and headed to the Kitchen and this time VERY carefully moved it close enough to sell everything not needed to those NPC's.    All in all, I made quite a *killing* over in that zone.  But at what cost?!   I also learned that dropping stuff on people kills them...

RareLight,93,1,0,September 1,Recommended,64.6,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of the best games ever created. It is about creating your own story and crafting your own experience. Characters can die before you even have the chance to meet them, even off-screen, so 2 playthroughs will never be the same. You can take a lot of decisions, be it slaughter a town, make enemies or allies, betray people, steal stuff, mind control them, eat them, absorb their souls, save a dude only to realize he has one hell of a sword and that you want it or decide between killing a dragon, freeing the dragon or breaking his shackles to challenge him to a fair battle to the death and so much more.  The game also features total freedom. You can always respect your character starting from act 2 and there is no class system. Everyone can change their equipments and skills on the go. Mixing certain tree skills allows you to create devastating combos and you can really enjoy watching as your character grows from a nobody to someone that can be praised, hate or feared across the land.  Music is extremly good and you can choose from up to 4 different instruments, each making the battlefield give off a different vibe and enriching your experience. From a calming flute to a intense chello. Graphics are also pretty good for a game of this scale, most areas are detailed and the effect of skills and environments are breath-taking. When you cast a thunder, it sounds and looks realistic, it gives a feeling that it is really going to zap someone's life out of them. Creatures design is also decent, while you might find stuff you had already seen multiple times in other games, there are also some stuff that has never been seen before. Like flesh eating elves that are also plants.  The only faults I find in this game are that it can be pretty hard for newcomers or people who don't play strategic games often, that it could explain some of it's mechanics better or be more detailed in how certain things came to be. But these are all minor complaints for the most part. Do yourself a favor a buy/play this game becuase if you don't you are only missing out on some of the best stuff on Steam.   A tip I would give to everyone who plays this game is to take the ""Pet Talk"" talent. It allows you to speak with animals!( or for them to speak with you) and this gives you access to some of the most funny stuff in the game as well as dead threats, unique situations, some of the most interesting characters and even foretelling of dark lords coming to kill all life on the planet.  5/5.  Would love to hear more about insects dark lords, being roasted by a LV 3 guy with a fire dragon and fighting inmortal trolls that won't allow you to pass through a bridge unless you pay insanes amount of golds."

I've put some time into this game, and just writing this makes me want to do a 4th playthrough. Buy this game."
Skwatch,196,1,0,September 28,Recommended,39.2,"Playing Divinity Original Sin feels very much like playing a Dungeons And Dragons game, and it's also the game it takes most of its inspiration from. It's an easier to understand version of DnD, and I think it is perfectly possible to release a PnP version of the core rules of the game. While these rules aren't really explained in-game, they are very intuitive and it's easy to comprehend what is going on behind combat.  I like Divinity Original Sin 2. It's a little bit different from the first game, but still it feels very fresh and the problems addressed with the first game are now gone.  Differences from the first game One of the biggest differences are now the ""two-type-of-armor-system"". One is physical and the other one magical. Little bit similar as in the Starfinder Pen And Paper RPG, where you got AC for physical damage and EC for Energy Damage. Other differences are balancing of the skills, damage dealing and spells. Also the action points are fixed. Crafting is different too and is now easier. The rock-paper-scissor mini game for conversations is also gone.  Another big difference are two new races, which in the beginning I wasn't really convinced of, but if you play further they fit really well into the story.  The Story The story is also in my opinion better told than in the first one.  I'm not a fan of voice acting in general, but this game does it really well, especially since dialogue is mostly text-based and everything is also voice acted. It's very nicely done. So you don't have to listen to the voice actors to know what is coming. You can just read and respond to it faster.  What is good about this game is that the story allows for multiple solutions to certain problems. This can be from ignoring the quest and fight your way through to multiple civil solutions you can do by ""roleplaying"".  These solutions aren't always clear and not everything is handed out to you by map markers or highlighted characters. You have to find out most of the stuff yourself.  The first time I played the starter island, I dumbly fought my way out of the prison. But actually on my second try of the game, I already found 4 ways of getting out of the prison. Which made me wonder now... how much stuff I have missed or didn't see the first or even the second time I will play through this game.  Combat Combat is very similar as in DnD. It's turn-based, which is fun. But sometimes also so slow when facing many enemies at once. It can also become very difficult at times. It's not an easy game.  So when combat starts, just as in most turnbased RPG's everybody gets their initiative, based on their initiative score and something else I don't have found out... That determines who gets first in combat. Note that turns always alternate between player and opponent. Your initiative only determines the order of your own characters.  The other difference in divinity from other RPG's is that no matter what, you will almost always do damage. The percentage of missing an attack is very low. I think characters can dodge an attack if they have the appropriate talent or if the attacker simply just missed. When dealing damage, you first have to destroy their respective armor and then you can lower their HP. Which is pretty cool. So you don't have to roll to hit against an armor number, which makes it possible and more fun to attack a higher level enemy with multiple characters. It gives you the sense that your attacks actually do something instead of miss. There is also a chance you do critical damage with each weapon. That percentage is also determined by your wits. And the percentage damage it does extra is determined by the weapon stats itself.  Damage dealt is also more fun than in D&D. You always do minimal damage with certain weapons. So if you have sword and it does between 5-8 damage it would be in DND 1d4+4. There is no way you do only 1 damage, there is no way you can roll bad. Also the damage of weapons and spells increase with your attributes.  Character Creation The damage you do, they hp you have, etc... is based on your attributes. Which is very similar to abilities in D&D. The names are sometimes different, but they work in the same way. The only new one is ""Wits"", it effects your critical chance, initiative and perception.  Next to attributes are abilities. Which are called skills in DnD. These increase characters effectiveness with weapons or allow you to take more skills. There are two kinds of abilities in the game. Combat and Civil abilities. Some help with bartering or sneaking other with damage of certain weapon types.  Then there are skills, which are also are a little bit like skills in D&D. They determine the effectiveness of your spells and weapons. The huge difference is that you can always learn a new skill, thus getting the proficiency with everything related to that skill. So if you want to cast fire spells with a certain character, just give him the pyromania skill. These skills get their bonuses from their respected attributes and scale with level. The weapon related skills scale with the weapons you have.  The skills you can actually do are those you have learned from skill books, which act like the feats from pathfinder or DnD 3.5. You can find those books or buy them from vendors. These are plenty and easy to find and mostly bossfights will reward you with one. The number of skills you can remember are determined by character level.  And then at last you have the talents, which are also a little bit like feats or special abilities in DnD. The talents are passive and give you certain perks. Like talking with animals, or you heal more if you are alone, stuff like that.  Similarities with DnD What also came over from 3.5 DND is that the range and damage of your ranged attacks are higher when having the higher ground. That you can flank enemies and that you can have attacks of opportunity. The different kind of states the characters can be in are also the same: sleepy, diseased, slowed, poisoned and they are also healed in almost the same way. The different kinds of terrain also work the same and make the combat very entertaining because it's a huge part of the game. It's also one of the first basic tricks for every DM in a rpg to make combat interesting by having cool environments.  O, yeah, graphics and stuff... Furthermore, the graphics and sounds are very good. The user interface is very well done with many effects to make it enjoyable to use.  Actually I'm not really into graphics of games and while this game is obviously more demanding and detailed in its graphics and sound in comparison to the first game, I still prefer... the original - not even the definitive edition - of the first game. Because of the more cartoony look. If you know me, my favorite type of graphics are those of the computer games between the years 1998 and 2004. Those were good times.  Only <3 for this game!"

The Guardian Fox,481,1,0,May 1,Recommended,189.5,"So good it will make you question WTF everyone else is spending time and money on when they develop an RPG. It's the best turn-based RPG I've played in a very long time, and one where I actually feel like I'm playing a role. Which is especially good since you all know we can't count on Final Fantasy for that fix anymore.  The Good: Fully voiced campaign, including all NPC's! (Even big budget titles don't do this!) All playable characters are customizable, and able to be used as their own character, including recruited companions. Pick an origin story, or make up your own. Fun, tactical, and innovative combat system. Very Replayable. Moddable, with a custom campaign creator to boot. As if that wasn't enough, it has a D&D style Game Master mode.  The Bad: Persuasion is overpowered. Don't get me wrong, I like having a charming character who can talk their way out of some situations, but it seems like most things in this game have persuasion options, sometimes when it wouldn't even make sense for someone to be convinced otherwise. It requires little effort to make a character to fulfill the necessary requirements, as it's easy to pump your main character full of persuasion and let other characters handle other areas. Sometimes I consider this a great boon to the role-playing side of things, but it also makes for a weaker experience in gameplay. One of the weakest aspects of the game in fact, IMO.  While Larian did an excellent job desiging the areas and leveling, enemy level scaling still doesn't exist. I know some people like those moments where you revisit an earlier part of a level and you can just murder everything, but I prefer every combat encounter to have weight.  I enjoy little moments in games like Elder Scrolls, where NPC's act racist, especially toward non-human races, because it's realistic, helps immersion, and gives you an added cause, with characters and concepts to combat. You want to do your character's race justice, perhaps change opinions, or get vengence. It's good for role playing. But in this game TOO MANY characters are racist. I get that they want to add text that changes based on a character's race but, good land, does everyone hate the lizard-folk? It seems like they do! Even the *animals* slander my main character. It just takes a good, immersive idea too far, and just pushes it to the point of being expected and annoying.  Overall, however, the positives outweigh the negatives by far. This is now one of my favorite games of all time, and I could not recommend it more."

Torsk79,203,1,0,"November 11, 2017",Recommended,173.3,"Divinity: Orginal Sin 2 is probably the closest I've felt that any game has come to replicating the Dungeons & Dragons experience in a video game.   This game has a combat system that is a close approximation of the D&D/Pathfinder ruleset and you can play with up to three other players for a multiplayer experience.  The game is difficult, even on the standard difficulty but I would highly recommend the game for fans of tactical RPGs."
Kudakero,103,1,0,"November 18, 2017",Recommended,156.0,"Just finished this game and I have to say this one of the best RPGs I've ever played. It feels like a D&D game story-wise and the decisions you make can have big consequences. Combat is awesome - complete with terrain variations, elements, and explosions. You control all characters in combat which means you aren't just stuck with one playstyle or character type. If you enjoyed the Dragon Age series this game will definitely pique your interest.  The music is awesome and powerfully sets the mood.  The only negative I really have is the pacing can sometimes be slow. Just go into the game with the understanding that it's going to take awhile if you plan on doing most of the content.   Due to how many plot choices and party choices you can make in a playthrough, I just beat it and am already mapping out my next playthrough!"

Even if you don't like RPGs, this game will change your mind. Even if you don't like top down and turn based strategies, this game will change your mind. Even if you don't like Single Player games, this game will change your mind.  Divinity Orginal Sin 2 is a breath of fresh air, the voice acting, the graphics, the character depth, the longlasting but interesting storyline, the freedom, the combat, and the overall complexity/amusement this game brings to you will make your reconsider what really well devloped games should be like.  It cannot be expressed enough on how enjoyable this game truly is, the subtle comedy and the well written diaglogues (with almost all voice acting) makes you cream. It's downright splendid. This game packs 20x as much content without any real DLCs, and depth/effort/time put into this game by the developer that is still cheaper than a AAA title? You've got to be kidding me!  Once you're finished playing this game, you'll be fed up with the rest of the mediocre, money grabbing and trashy AAA title games on the market.  Thank you Larian Studios."

You play the game as you want, there are many combat skill combinations and ways to approach quests and dialogue, but that can also lead to a lack of meaningful gameplay when you sort of get how it all runs and are doing things just to do them becasue you dont feel super invested in your character.

Vinny Vally,205,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,65.5,"Awesome!  So me and 3 of my mates are playing the campaign together - Each of us for the first time so it's all fresh and fun!  Last night we were attacking a group on a balcony which drew aggro from 3 below - There were 2 stairways up to us, one directly and one that went ALL the way around the balcony.  Within a turn or two, two of the guys at the bottom start running up to us. On the close stairway I cast rain and lightning it, stunning the two. After the lightning effect wears off, I oiled a portion of the area and slowed them down. During this time, we finish of most of the enemies up high. The third guy however walked in circles at the bottom seemingly ignoring us...  After a turn or two more, the 2 guys on the stairs reached myself so I teleported one of them back to the bottom to give us some extra time. When I did this, the third guy STILL at the bottom decided to ATTACK his own TEAMMATE to heal himself!! He was on full health!! He just attacked poor Timothy for no reason hahaha!!  Sooooo, a few turns later, the second guy had run back up the stairs and we'd dealt with him and all the others. Just the third guy remaining... He, who obviously wanted no part in this fight, had decided to, for whatever reason, to go up the other stairs and ALLLLLLLL the way around...  So, we decided to set a plan of ambush - Because at this point we were all laughing and just mocking this particular guy anyway - So we all gathered on the balcony that the path led to just around a corner, except for our support guy who stood right at the back of the path.. I set a layer of ice, and some oil, and then we just skipped turns for him to run to us.  Finally, one turn away, JUST around this corner we could see him. I froze the poor guy, and someone else warmed him up just to toy with him. We were all laughing given how long it took for him to get there... HIS TURN!! FINALLY!! We figured we'd let him hit just one of us just because.. But no!! What's this?? He's run past me... And my friend... And another... And then past 2 minions... Where's he going?!?! hahahaha. He ran directly at the support guy but ran out of AP and just stood next to him thinking for a while, then passed his go! Hahahaha!! He'd just about made it around the entire balcony when we finally killed him..  God damn that was funny!! Cannot wait till we're all online tonight :D    Basically the same game as the first but with improvements in skills, choices, graphics, etc. Highly recommended!"

Anyway, the game is a typical Larian Studios game. They put a lot of effort in every little detail, even if you wont see half of them in one playthrough. The possibilities of problemsolving to almost everything are huge. And of course its played best with some friends who each have their own main character and own questlines.  This adds a lot to the replay value, not only that all of the six ""origin"" characters have their own unique quest, everyone does their own adventuring if you reach new places and get quest for the group find secrets or loot for himself"

Astroflap,78,1,0,August 31,Recommended,125.9,"TL;DR Buy this game! Best RPG game I've ever played and in my top 3 games of all time without a doubt. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay here. The gameplay is quality unlike games like Skyrim which pretty much relies on mods to be fun for extended play sessions, which this game also offers. Dialog and story is also some of the best you'll find in recent games with  every piece of dialog being voiced which is just a great thing for an Indie game to do.  Seriously 9.9/10 game.  This is honestly the best RPG I have ever played and one of the best games I've played in general. This is one of the few single-player games that I just can't stop playing.   Before I played this game me and my friends played a lot of D&D, but we couldn't find enough time to play as much as we'd like since we were in our final year of school. So for ages I looked for a game that could emulate that same expirence. Being able to do what I want, having funny moments as well as epic. When one of my friends showed me this I was hooked.   The mechanics are almost the exact same as old school table top games, so iif you're into that turn based combat you'll love this, but even someone like me that normally hates those kind of combat mechanics in games I just loved these just because of how polished they were. The combat suprisingly has a lot of depth to it. There's so many different spells and equipment and many of them interact with eachother in their own ways.  The story and dialog is also one of the best I've ever seen in a game. Most of the dialog has so much character and is of such high quality, only of the voices feel as they were acted poorly, but 10000x better than you'll see in any Bethesda game. The fact that all of the dialog in the game is voice acted is also just an amaznig thing. It makes it feel as you're living in a real world and it also helps with the consistancy where some lines would be voiced and some wouldn't. This wouldn't mean anything iff the story wasn't good, which thankfully it isn't. The story is so good. It pulls you emotionally in so many different directions and you have to make so many decisions that make or break relationships and have an effect on what happens for the rest of the game.  Character creation is also pretty good, different races and classes having different traits and abilities as per usual. This part is the only part that I find to be pretty hard on new characters since some races and classes are harder to play than others, which can make it difficult and punishing. This can become a non-issue early in the game since you have the choice to pretty much change everything about you if you're not happy about it.  The one thing that I wish could be different about the game is its modding cababilities. Sadly as of now there aren't any mods anywhere near as big as mods that you find in Bethesda games, but thankfully this isn't a Bethesda game so you don't need mods to make it interesting lmao. This game does have the ability to act as your own Dungeon Master and make a whole game for you, your friends and your fellow steam gamers. and you also have the ability to download other peoples campains which just extends the hundreds of hours in the base game.  This game is almost a perfect example of what a game should be. For the gamer by not constantly trying to ram microtransactions down every hole in your body, have hundreds of high quality content from launch. Constant interaction with the community, THESE GUYS MAKE VLOGS MAN!!! and last but not least they don't do what every triple-a developer is doing now and making all their content and just releasing it as expansions. These guys are just about to release a FREE expansion that adds hundreds of more hours of gameplay which I would be more than happy to pay for since it is actually worth it and it's made to add value to the game instead of be a stupid cash grab.     SO IN SUMMARY. Buy this game, its amazing how an indie studio made on of the best games of recent times from a kickstarter with a reasonably small studio compared to multi-billion dollar companies that make subpar games at best. These people really care about what they create and it shows in their final product. I recommend this game to everyone and I feel like a better person everytime I do so."

N1. NerdetssKi,268,1,0,February 24,Recommended,99.3,"Great game, great engine, fun combat.   Not Quite as good as Pillars of Eternity though. I found myself comparing the 2 a lot during my 100 hour play through of the campaign to the end.  During that play through I spent half my time playing the game and half my time loading quick saves. It might just be how I deal with multiple outcomes in situations but it also came from making constant stupid mistakes. This game really shows you just how smart or dumb you are as a person, or at least makes you feel like a complete idiot so many times.    Part of the reason why Divinity 2 made me feel like a dummy was probably due to how much I had to rely on Google and Game Wiki's to get quests done or to get through situations or puzzles. Too often it felt like the game hadnt given me enough clues or any at all to progress through some situations, and that can be completely on me most the time for being thick in the head, but I found more than a few times that it happened turned out to be something that I would never have discovered no matter how switched on I was. For example theres a moment you have to put a specific framed picture onto a plaque on the ground to unlock a hatch you wouldnt even know was there to continue the story and there was no way of guessing you had to do that and the only clue it gave was so vague that I wouldnt have put 2 and 2 together in a million years. Moments like that made the game as frustrating as it was enjoyable.  Theres something about Pillars of Eternity's flow through the locations and storyline that was just so much more peacful, Immersive and enjoyable for me compared to Divinity 2, but when I compare these games together PoE only just comes out on top against Divinity for the reasons I mentioned above.  I recommend this game, but I must say, before you start, book a week off school or work and turn your phone off, because its all you're going to do until you finish it."

Moustachio'ED,40,1,0,February 25,Recommended,52.1,"The game itself is great and a true continuation and development of all that was loved and praised about the first Original Sin; however, and it's a big however, the engine is buggy as hell.  There's an odd core usage issue which means that multi core cpus are not utilized and the game dumps everything onto a single core - notice the strange frame skip stutter when panning?  That's a core usage issue and nothing else.  It seems the devs either don't care to fix the issue or can't fix the issue, which means one has to set the processor affinity to a single core and then back to all cores in task manager every single time one plays the game.  Not cool.  So if they sort that out, it's a highly recommended game; if not, it's still recommended but be prepared to tune your system every playthrough.  Oh yes, also there are issues with overclocked CPUs and GPUs.  Come on Larian, get your technical issues as sorted out as you've gotten the combat in this game."
Nesdude,60,1,0,"October 8, 2017",Recommended,254.3,"After beating the game on classic difficulty.  Pros: Fun tactical combat Largely voiced, either by the narrator or the NPCs. Good story and writing in general Smart enemy AI Animations satisfying to watch Sounds are well done Good music. Not as good as Nier: Automata. But still fairly good. A long game. First run took me ~130 hours, looking through every nook and cranny I could find, reading everything, using no walkthroughs. Tons of replayability. Many different choices, several different races and origin stories with different perspectives. Multiplayer (which I haven't touched yet) Mod support (which I haven't touched yet) Tons of flexibility as far as what your character can become. Many side quests which are well done, Several of which span across acts. Clearly defined ""Point of no return"" points.  Cons: Doesn't hold your hand as much as other games. (Which I personally like, but some people might not.) Balance issues between the classes (Debateable) Noticeable drop in quality in the final act. MIssing voiceovers. One notorious and buggy enemy encounter where weak enemies keep respawning, potentially for hours, with no xp gain. Quests more screwy. One NPC talked to a party member calling them someone else who has never been in the party. Needs patching. (My main complaint) The crafting system largely expects you to experiment. No materials are lost upon a failed combination. But I'm not going to bash things together all day until something works. At the end of the game I was still mostly unsure if most of the stuff I collected had any use. There are anvils and blacksmithing tools, but crafting armor/weapons/food dishes never seemed worth it and were a waste of space. Etc. Inventory system needs to be more user friendly. Like selecting multiple things at once. Or a search function. The storage box needs to be broken down into categories just like your inventory is.  Overall, tons of bang for your buck, which is what I'm all about. 9/10. Would be 10/10 if it wasn't for the issues in the final act."

The big game developers have taken advantage of the gamer community for far too long by releasing crap after crap unfinished indie turds, and pay to play DLC to boot..

I played the game with one character to the end of the first Act and all of the fights were very challenging and entertaining. The only complaint I have at this point is the crafting system, which still seems very cryptic. I presume it will be improved for the final release, but as it stands, I was only able to craft some arrows and potions. The recipes and books I found were all restricted to arrows, potions, and some cooking stuff (the cooking stuff seemed pretty useless up to now). Apart from that, the game looks and plays beautifully. The history is pretty interesting as well and keeps you immersed and hooked for what's coming next. I actually felt a bit sad after beating Act 1 because I want to play the rest of the game so bad, but I know I'll have to wait at least a month until it gets released. In conclusion, if you played DOS1, you have to play this game. If you're new to the series and enjoy very well designed turn-based RPGs, with challenging fights and a myriad of different skills and spell combinations to choose from, then you also have to play it."

Roadie,207,1,0,September 10,Recommended,245.1,"Divinity: OS 2 takes the base of the first game, that is already considered one of the best CPRGs out there, and revises it's battle and stats system to be even better. It removes the randomness of the first game and instead adds armour system, that shifts the game more towards strategy focused on disabling enemies and keeping your armour up as well as using several different added little advantages throughout the battlefield. All these changes make honour (hardcore) mode entirely possible  and extreemly satisfying to beat even for casual players on second of third playthrough. The game also contains a good amount of books, that can fill out newcomers to the series on the story of all the previous games. Overall i highly recomend this game to everyone, but also advise to play Divinity: OS 1 first because playing it after the this game feels realy weird."

Natebody,10,1,0,"September 4, 2017",Recommended,165.3,"Early Access Review:   Original Sin 2 is what exactly what every RPG gamer has been looking for - there's a potency to its' immersion that every EA title should aim to hit. This is the caliber of gaming you (EA devs) should truly attempt to employ!!!! It's an absolute masterpiece of Early Access gaming. A true game of D&D mixed with chess.......Larian said they posted this game on steam with a laugh, and I know why!! Ok I'll stop with the hype and explain.   (Graphics, optimization, controls, gameplay, sound.)   Graphics/Animations: 10/10  Right from the jump you notice how polished the world and characters look. From beautiful landscapes to fluid animations, I love it!!!! Nothing left to say here! Excellent job!   Optimization: 10/10  No loading screens.. LIKE EVER during your gaming experience! Excellent work!   Controls: 9/10  No complaints other than the restriction of your camera angles. Part of the experience is viewing a gorgeous and artistic world... You can never look at the sky....and view your character from better angles.. sad. Although, you can rebind your keys, you can rotate and zoom in - You feel like you're in control. Great job!   Gameplay: 9.5/10  This is where the bulk of the game lies. From story to combat - the immersion starts with the world appearance and story narrative, then ends with a blast with its' combat delivery. The combat is spaced out making you feel like you're not always in a chat box, and you'll be satisfied in casting, buffing or even simple melee attacks.  You can be whatever you want to be. Unless you want to be an orc...you can't be an orc - BUT what you can do from what they have to offer makes you feel like you're totally in control of your character's person.   Yes, customization is quite limited. I like my rpgs to let me customize my character to the ""T"" ... and this does limit you in that aspect to a certain extent...better than most games but coming from MMOs you may be disappointed. Given a more customizable character and maybe even adding a few other races .. you'll never play the same character again. Character creation is key in this type of genre - still ... Excellent work!   Music/Sound: 9.5/10  The sound and music is fantastic! ... I'd still love to hear a larger variety of music during gameplay...This will probably end up being a 10 simply because they will add voice acting and more music throughout the future acts. Excellent job!   Overall: 10/10  The story, the adventure, the combat, the scenery, the ..... oh you get it already!!!! What a phenomonal game. RPG lovers, MMO lovers...hack'n'slash lovers... VIDEO GAME LOVERS! You'll love this. I wouldn't post my first review on steam if I didn't believe this to be a game for everyone on steam. Do enjoy! Thanks Larian!"

xace,56,1,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,65.8,"One of the best games I have ever played.  Several bugs and lack of features make it fall just short of that #1 however.  My main concerns are in multiplayer. You have to play as the hosts party characters and not your own. That means playing an archer with a level 2 bow, all stats in wits and other useless talents. There is also an endless amount of bugs with multiplayer. For example, if I am host and start a multiplayer and someone joins me as say The Red Prince and I save, restart whatever, that character then becomes bugged. Instead of reverting back to The Red Prince after that player leaves, he bears that persons name and is unable to be reset, or even dismissed. You normally can talk to npc's in your party and say you want to go your seperate ways and recruit another party member, nope. bugged.  Another example is I use one of my npc's for dialect options since they have persuasion stats and my main is undead. Someone joined the game and took control of MY character and when I leveled up he butchered his stats and skills and those remained on my character after I kicked him and / or restarted the game.  These things make multiplayer extremely frustrating and have forced me to start brand new games probably about 6 times now. I haven't even been able to get through act 1. I am very wary to play in multiplayer due to all these reasons and despite preferring multiplayer in it's theory am forced to play single player to avoid game breaking bugs like those i mentioned. I wish I could provide some feedback or get some kind of bug fix on this bug I don't see an option for that. Thankfully the developer is very involved in the game and will probably fix this at some point. I am now hoping that a user created mod will fix many of these issues in the future (thank god this game has mods)  Despite all my frustrations this game is absolutely incredible in every other aspect. Everything is voiced, every npc which is amazing. Graphics are good (not great) especially for this type of game. Quests are actually fun and not all fetch they actually have lore. There is an absolute freedom: you can kill every npc and still proceed with the game. The gameplay is some of the best ever. This genre has been ruined in the past decade with games like the Final Fantasy series dropping the traditional turn-based combat for an active combat. Yeah, thats nice in some circumstances but it is extremely boring hacking and slashing repetitively just like every other game. The combat in D:OS2 is calculated, and detailed. Everything is listed and heavily focused on strategy and statuses. The game encourages using environments such as high ground and environmentals like barrels and puddles in order to gain favor in battle.   The best part of the game is the fact it's challenging. The default difficulty will probably be too hard for average gamers and those not familiar with the genre or the first game. There are two higher difficulties on top of that which are extremely challenging (I normally play on the highest difficulty in every other game) The next best thing would be that the developers aren't EA, Ubisoft, Activision, etc and force paywalls on an incomplete game and don't support the game after launch. This dev actually cares and I have personally downloaded atleast one patch per day and they have already stated that they are going to implement being able to use your own character in multiplayer which is something I look forward to. Can't wait to see what's next for this game."

UKLonar,209,1,0,"November 9, 2017",Recommended,83.5,"I'd absolutely recommend picking this game up. It's a masterpiece of the modern age, with a classic-styled twist.  Although difficult at times, you can usually figure out a method of beating fights. Despite what some people are saying, the game isn't too hard. There are so many builds/skills you can choose from and many many sidequests to get gear and level up; better preparing you for the difficult fights. You also don't need to go online and look for ""Cookie cutter"" builds. So don't let people put you off!  Although, get used to ""Savescumming"" whilst you learn encounters.  I'm not well versed with CRPG's so I was hesitant to pick this game up initially.  However, I'd now recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs.  I'll be running through my second-playthrough soon, as I know I've missed a fair bit!  Give it a chance, you won't regret it! "

Ark,353,1,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,133.8,"Words cannot fully describe how wonderful the game is. After 106 hours I have finally finished it on tactician difficulty - the second highest out of 4 difficulty levels - and it's been one hell of a ride. In the pool of games that have filled the cRPG genre over time some are remembered for the gems that they are. This game truly deserves a place among those stars.    Short and quick: The best aspects The combat offers a huge variety of possibilites. 200+ spells allow you to build your character exactly to your liking. They aren't all magical, they don't all scale with intelligence like you'd expect from classical RPGs meaning you can mix a lot of combinations on your character. Don't think of spells as a 'magician only' thing. Every character will use a wide variety and it feels amazing to have this much choice in battle.  The AI will use insane combinations and synergies of spells just as much as you do. They will sacrifice their own if it gives them an advantage, they will use the environment against you.   No ridiculous RNG: Although dicerolls aren't completely banished out of the game these mechanics never feel unfair like in some other RPGs. Games based on pen & paper tend to use a lot of dicerolls but here you'll find that most mechanics have been modified to be very clear about how they work without relying on RNG. Doesn't mean critical attacks aren't possible if you want to play that way ;-)  There are no classes. Don't get mistaken by the character creation, it's only meant to be a help for the early game. You level and can spent your points on the different schools of sorcery. You're never restricted because of a 'class' and after leaving the first area you can fully respecc at any time. You can truly built your character the way you want to.  The worldbuilding is amazing. There is so much to explore, so many NPCs to talk to and stories to experience.  The characters - from simple animals to essential NPCs - are just as amazingly written as the world. Some you'll love, some you'll laugh about, some you'll hate, but never will you think they are acting out of character.   The choice is always yours. One moment you're a saint, next moment you decide an NPC isn't worth keeping alive. Although sometimes limited, there are always consequences.   To further strengthen the last point: You can play the game anyway you want and never hit a roadblock in the story. Even if you murder every NPC you see you'll be able to finish the story.   Play the entire campaign with up to 4 players. 'nuff said  The voiceacting is phenomenal. Everything in this game is voiced, including the narrator. Not only that, but the variety in voices is so large you will rarely - if ever - notice two voices sounding alike. Every unimportant guard, every NPC without a name, every animal in the wild, every character - no matter how essential they are to the story - sounds different and they manage to bring the emotions their words carry to life.  The soundtrack manages to describe the atmosphere in a wonderful way.   Although the story is rather serious, the little sprinkles of humor every now and then shine brightly.  Short and quick: The worst aspects The companions sidequests are wonderful and they influence the main story quite a lot. But everywhere else they're a little pale as they rarely voice their oppinion on what you do during the rest of the journey.   This game can easily overwhelm you. If you're familiar with the cRPG gerne you'd expect this but everyone else be warned: This is not a game you finish in a couple of hours nor is it a linear game. Having a huge freedom means your questlog will burst at times.  The difficulty is real. Even on classic - the normal mode - you'll get your♥♥♥♥♥handed to you on a silver plater. I finished the game in 106 hours on tactician - one difficulty above classic - and my save game told me I was 'alive' for 80 hours. That means I had 26 hours of reloading because of party wipes or decisions that I regreted. I thoroughly enjoyed the difficulty but be warned: It's not to be taken lightly.   A slight negative about undeads: If you play one or have one in your party you can chose to hide your undeadness and the story will acknowledge this but the combat won't. I assume it's done for the sake of difficulty and interesting gameplay, but enemies will always know that you're an undead and chose tactics that work against undeads like e.g. hurting you with healing magic.  After all is said, it's still a cRPG. There's a lot to read, a lot of sidequests to do and a lot of possibilites in how you tailor the story around you. Don't go into this game with wrong expectations. It's huge. Having wrong expectations can easily ruin the experience for you.  You might wonder even with all the high praise you've heard about this game how it compares to the best of the cRPG genre. It's not simple to answer this as classics like Baldur's Gate can be hard to enjoy these days. Some of the most defining games of this genre came out in the late 90's to early 00's after all. Divinity: Original Sin 2 takes the things that made those classics wonderful and wraps them into a modern engine. It learned from all the mistakes that happened with the first 'Original Sin' game and improved greatly on them. So in summary, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. For me it's not only the RPG of the year, it's a strong contender for game of the year."

DarthGrignr,154,1,0,March 1,Recommended,138.9,I bought this game on a whim because I saw that I could finally be a skeleton in an RPG.  What I got was so much more than that.  I've only worked through the first part (I think?) and have been throughly blown away.  The amount of player agency is amazing and nearly unheard of in modern games.  Larian used their Kickstarter money well and I can't wait to see what else they can do.
Jule Damn,37,1,0,March 2,Recommended,44.3,"I played part the Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition and enjoyed that, so I decided to get DOS 2 after I saw it on sale for a modest 10% (also because my friends had the game and I wanted to play with them).   As it turns out, this game is such an improvement on the first game that I just cant go back to DOSEE. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an amazing game that quite literally builds on every positive element of the Enhanced Edition and makes the game so much smoother and comprehensive.   YOU CAN NOW ACCESS ALL INVENTORIES OF YOUR PARTY MEMBERS IN ONE WINDOW. PRAISE LARIAN STUDIOS. Improvements were also made to many mechanics such as: Crafting, purchasing/bartering, targeting AOE spells.  The storyline is also so much more rich now that you have 5 preset characters to choose from (and the option to create your own). Right off the bat, I was much more engaged in DOS2's story than I ever was in the EE. I love their banter. I love that ALL party members can engage in dialogue, thus giving you multiple opportunities to get the ""right"" answers without needing to reload the game. The voice acting is great and the characters have personalities true to their plights.   If you enjoy story-rich games, this one's for you! (If the turn-based combat system deters you, there is the option to play the game in Explorer Mode to make the combat easier and thus a secondary feature).  TL;DR: This game is lots of fun! Kudos to a development team that listens to its community in order to improve on previous iterations of its game(s)!"

I will tell you right now, if I see an added DLC for more story content, to continue on from where you leave off at the end, I will pay the price. Please I beg of you Larian Studios, make more story content, playable races (i.e. the Orc and Imp would be fun), add more zones, I would gladly support you!

Gilmez,113,1,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,217.3,"THE STORY: This is by far the most densely rich lore I’ve played through from any game I’ve played, where almost everyone and everything is connected in one way or another. Creating a living and breathing world, where one’s actions and decisions will affect their adventures through Rivellon. The part where this game shines the most, is how it gives the player choices on how they want to advance the story in any way the player chooses to play. Choose to be good, evil, just or whatever mood you choose, this game adapts to it and guides you to the end that your choices led to. While I’ve only completed Fane’s Story (in the moment of writing this), the endings it gives you will satisfy however you played. While you can choose how your adventure ends, the game lets you know how those actions will affect Rivellon in the future. The reason why I love this story is how grim and real this story plays out, no one is truly good or evil, it’s all a grey area, but it’s your choice on how you want to navigate in it.  THE COMBAT: There was never a dull moment every time I went into battle, or stumble on to one. While combat is turn-based, pre-battle is when things become interesting. Some approaches I found to be more fun is laying out traps and pre-emptive attacks on unknowing enemies. I can go into combat with my enemies clinging on 5% health and wipe them out with one attack. This is true liberty that this game gives to players, it gives you the tools and it’s up to you on how to use them. And this is just combat, skills can give a creative twist to combat. You can chain attacks to deliver devastating blows to your enemies or toy around with them by unleashing various Statues Effects and skills that can either immobilize them or transform them into chickens. All this creates a simple yet complex toy box you can play with. Finding out what seems fun and effective will make you want to seek out the next battle and unleash your battle plan.  THE MUSIC: I do not, in any way, have any complaints or criticisms about the music. The only thing I can say is that it is Divine. The music makes Rivellon and in turn makes you believe that it is a real place and these characters who live in it are part of a giant play. The 4 instruments that you can pick (while you build your character) creates the mood in how you want to play and you can change it any time you want.  This is the best RPG for this generation. While there are quite a few bugs the developer needs to fix, this doesn’t affect how much I love this game. "

Oberain,583,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,170.0,"I'm going to be honest here; I didn't like the first Original Sin.  I found the combat surprisingly clunky, the ""two protagonist"" playstyle akin to mashing action figures together as a child and the NPCs bland and empty.  Just everything about it wasn't as good as the raving crowds claimed.    This?  This is amazing.  This is so far one of my favorite PC RPGs I've ever played...and I'm old enough to remember the original Ultima and Gold Box DnD games.  Most areas and quests have multiple solutions and you're not really punished for taking one over the other.  There are a few areas where lockpicking is basically required but besides that stealth, conversation or brute force are typically viable options to dealing with a problem.  Combat feels tactical (something most RPGs frankly don't really do anymore) with your choices in positioning, abilities and terrain manipulation meaning the difference between victory or defeat more often than just pure stats.  With careful planning you can beat groups of enemies better geared and higher levels than you, though it's still unlikely as one lucky crit can one shot a character.  There are very few mindless ""throw away"" battles once you leave the tutorial island.  Almost every encounter will be an actual fight for your life.  There are some areas the game can be improved further.  While your companions will pipe up more and put more of their character on display than the original, it's not quite enough.  The process in which it happens is sterile and lacks organic interaction.   Instead of the NPCs talking as if the other NPCs were standing around them, they spout their one line and that's it.  If, say, the Red Prince spoke to Fane or Sebille during the journey it would go a long way to viewing them as characters instead of interchangable henchmen that happened to have a  bit of backstory or a sidequest attached. So yes, as much as people like to♥♥♥♥♥♥on Bioware...this could benefit by being more like Bioware in that regard.  Another complaint is I never feel like I'm at the point I'm supposed to be at with gear.  I consistantly feel like I'm a few levels behind with my armor and health offering a totally negligable amount of protection with some enemies wiping my party before I even get a turn.  I don't even know how the game can really ""fix"" this other than perhaps tossing in an NPC somewhere explaining that each level gives shops DRAMATICALLY better gear and the difference between level 10 and level 12 is roughly 150% increase in defense.   Oh and do ignore the publications out there that act like plaiyng Undead is sooo hard.  You literally NEVER have a reason to not be in full armor and you can easily heal from poison damage and poison potions.  It's really not a challenge at all.  Edit and Addtions:  I had originally complained at some poor coding regarding playing a non-origin character and how playing an undead PC made the game think you were Fane leading to some broken quests and ridiculous immersion breaking dialogue.  It seems since launch most of these issues have been patched and some major story moments have been reworked.  It's disappointing they were in the game at all as I can't fathom why anyone would WANT to play as an ""origin"" companion instead of a real character and why playing a real character would end up being so buggy but...that's just me."
Behemoth,662,1,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,46.6,"A truly incredible CRPG. The best modernization of the genre that has yet been made.  So many options.

Kirikitomi,25,1,0,October 31,Recommended,264.1,"I'm the type of person that will flat out stop playing a game if the story fails to engage me. With Divinity 2, the Story was interesting and I felt like there was a lot to be said for being able to approach the game as a character I design vs. one of the compelling Origin characters.  Origin Characters/Companions. Not every companion/Origin is created equal; yes, some companions generally are better than others. Some may have a personality that some individuals find intolerable. But. Unlike many games, your companions classes are completely customizable. You aren't stuck leaving behind a person you enjoy having in your party because their ability tree is junk. That feature alone, is worthy of praise.   Crafting: Most games I play have stupid crafting systems. Divinity 2 is no exception, but you can ignore it for the most part, except in the case of creating a few quest items. It is not the worst system, but neither do I find it particularly enjoyable. It's there if you want it, but don't expect to craft some badass weapons without dling a bunch of mods.  The story itself, in my opinion, is superior to it's predecessor. The Lore felt accessible, rather than confusing and off-putting. The romance system seemed rather nice. Keeping in mind that I've only followed the paths of Ifan, Lohse, and Sebille, I can certify that those three were all satisfying, but in very different ways. I've read that the other ones leave something to be desired, but I can say that the romance doesn't make me want to roll my eyes nor experience disappointment,   The turn-based combat enables an individual to strategize and play to the strengths of their charactersl  I could write more, but I will say that I put off purchasing this game for a year because Divinity Original Sin 1 was okay, maybe even good, but it wasn't memorable to me. Divinity Original Sin 2 broke free of that mould of mediocrity and left an impression with me that has firmly snared a memorable top five games that I've played in my life.   Take from this what you will!"

I look back with solem regret I didn't buy this game long before finals. It's in our moments of stress and weakness we look to games to distract us from our hobbies. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is not just a distraction. Assuming it was just that marked my grade's fate.  It's a masterpiece of a game. A true storybook in a sense. It's something that will envelope you into a world of its own and keep you there for hours on end. Should you buy this game? If you're looking for a new hobby that you can invest a couple hundred hours a week into, buy this now. If your schedulle only allows for a few hours here and there, realize you can live off welfare and still buy this game now."

AtomicTampon,87,1,1,September 5,Recommended,168.4,"Quick review on the only thing ive seen complained about in reviews  The armor system... few bad reviews on this armor system might scare off potential buyers so ill throw this bit out there. because EVERYONE should try this game if they like RPG's, its amazing.  All the armor system really does is take away ""easy mode"", you cant really cast a bunch of CC 5 feet before engaging battle so your enemies are all goofed up and unable to move before turn 1. (something ill admit to doing a lot in Div1)  Example (you see 4 archers in the distance), you make it rain on them, blast lightning into it, they all get stunned and cant move and then you engage the 4 archers causing enemy lose their entire first turn... potentially second too. Personally i found it to be a little cheesy and im glad the armor system was added to circumvent this tactic of ""easy win"".   Now you gotta strip the armor before CC will work, and to those who wanna play heavy CC toon, Make sure you have lower initiative than your party so they can strip the armor before your up to bat with the CC.   Now quit reading this and buy this game! you wont regret it.... And if you do some how regret it, seek phycological help because its YOU not the game :D"
A b h a o t h,189,1,0,August 29,Recommended,129.3,"If you enjoy tactics, deep story with a character that truly feels like a part of the world, this games for you. I have a pretty heavy D&D background and admittedly I don't know how much closer a game could replicate that style of fun in a more traditional 3rd person rpg. It certainly isn't for the faint of heart though, this game will force you to concoct at least a few strategies more than smack it with sword. The multiplayer is smooth, and the dialogue prompts between characters, custom or not, really nail home that ""part of this world"" vibe. Seriously, give it a shot. I promise you'll find yourself looking at so many juicy plot hooks that side quests become as attractive as the main quest."
Emmie,93,1,0,August 29,Recommended,"1,078.3","Divinity Original Sin 2 (original release) is somewhat skeletal overall yet puts forth content that is top tier. The developers obviously poured their hearts and souls into this game and it shows. The one element that holds me back from claiming it as my favorite game is that there are too many gaps. Why am I able to wipe out an entire Island's population before I disembark to a new land? The punishment is insignificant for doing so. Some stories seem to have a fabulous background yet it remains a facade of sorts. With the new edition coming out presently, I think a lot of the issues will be resolved and new content will breathe new life into this amazing game. I will say it again; the developers really put their hearts into this game and it is obvious that they are talented artists and designers."

Deltarizon,104,1,0,April 6,Recommended,175.3,"Well lets start off with a brief description of the game. You're a captive on a ship, a Sourceror, one of the most hated people across the land. Your foul magic attracts monstrosities known as the Voidwoken, nightmares from another dimension that seek to claim this world as their own. However, things quickly roll out of hand, and it ends with the ships destruction. Finding yourself on the prison island known as Fort Joy, you discover that you're no ordinary Sourceror; you have the potential to become a GOD. From there, the game plays out quite literally as YOU choose it, be it as a benevolent hero seeking to save the world or as a malicious villain who seeks to gain ultimate power. And, just maybe, you'll find an option that no one else expected, one that takes you through the Void itself... and finding power that scoffs at the Gods themselves.  As you can probably tell, there's a lot of choices to be made in Divinity 2 : Original Sin, and maybe you're thinking ""Oh god, it's another one of these games that plays out as a visual novel instead of a rpg"". Well if you are thinking that, shut the ♥♥♥♥ up, strap in, and read up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ because there's quite a bit more to the game than that.   Now, the best part about this game is it's combat system and character progression; there are few other games where I can actually feel the progression of my character and the impact it has on the world around me. For example, in my very first TRUE playthrough of the game, 100% it, I did it with just two characters, both of them basically assassins; it was hard at first of course, but by the end of the game I could clear a room of 12 heavily armored characters with 2 characters and taking no damage. It truly felt powerful, and is one of my favorite gaming playthroughs of all time. So I thought, ♥♥♥♥ it, lets try a magical playthrough, might not be as fun as the first, but we'll get through it. Well. Lets just say a full elementalist party is quite a unique experience. The whole 4 person party felt powerful the entire game, and we destroyed everything in sight that we deemed ""Unholy"" or ""Unclean"". Felt ♥♥♥♥ing hilarious the entire way through, and I don't regret a moment of it. For my thrid play through, I went in with a full melee team, and got the exact same results, which has blown me out of the water and clear into the sky; the fact that no matter what kind of team you play you know you'll become a force to be reckoned with is fantastic, and lets you cook up some pretty kooky team compilations. If you don't believe me, go on youtube and look up some of the SOLO builds people can make; they play on the highest difficulty and can quite literally nuke entire areas with a single character. But I digress, that's a bit off topic, and not relevant to this review. So if you've ever felt let down by a characters power or capability, trust me, you won't feel that with this game.  Let's talk diversity for a quick second here. There are 4 main races in the world, the Dwarves, Humans, Elves, and Lizards. Each race has its own unique capabilities, and it's own racial traits, meaning that yes, while you can have a Lizard assassin, making it a human so it have bonus initiative (how soon it gets to move in combat) and extra critical chance (random extra damage) means you'll have an easier time. Or maybe you'll choose a lizard for your geomancer because you have the innate ability to breath fire, and ignite your oil based abilities. A dwarven Inquisitor stands ready to rush into your opponents because they have extra defenses against all forms of damage. And maybe your necromancer is an elf because elves can eat parts of their enemies to learn memories and skills they'd normally never obtain. No matter what it is, you'll find tons of combinations based off of race alone to make a unique and fun character. But is that where it stops? Nope, that's where we're just getting started. See, there is a unique twist you can put on a character; you can make them UNDEAD. Yes, that's right, a skeleton that walks and talks, and which offers other unique pros and cons. For example, an undead character will heal when poisoned, and take damage when healed normally. Skeletons can use their bony fingers as infinite use lockpicks. And most importantly, Skeletons don't have any nasty organs to inhale Deathfog, an uncommon terrain in the game which kills anything that breaths it, meaning that Undead are free to wander through it as they please. The only real downside is having to wear a headpiece at all times. (Which isn't even a downside, like, why would you decide to not wear an important piece of equipment?) But lets say you dislike making all of that troublsome character stuff, you just want to get in and have fun. Well, there are already a ton of premade characters with their own stories and quests to go on if you so choose! There's literally no way to go wrong with making a character in this game!  Hey, we almost missed the most important part of the game, the part where you become a god and stuff! Well friendo, that's what I saved for last because that♥♥♥♥♥♥is called SPOILERS, and I know that some people dislike those. So let it be said now that if you don't want to read any spoilers WHATSOEVER, then you should skip the next paragraph. Cool? Cool.  So as your character progresses through the game, they will discover the ability to use Source to fuel abilities. These are their godly powers, and are only usable by player characters and certain other npcs. This includes the abilites; Bless : Buffs an ally and clears any and all curses that afflict them. Spirit Vision : Is actually free to cast, and lets you temporarily see into the spirit realm, where you can see parts of the past, and even talk with the dead to gain their wisdom. (Or even just to taunt an enemy who bugged you.) Devour : Not it's actual name, but I don't use it often enough to remember it. It's also free to cast. You basically target an enemy corpse (or even just directly target their ghost.) and devour their essence, regaining a source point. Doing this too many times however can mark you with the ""Villain"" tag, which is not what you want to have on you if you're roleplaying as a benevolent hero. Gate : Again, isn't the true spell name, but works the same as the D&D version, creating a permanent link to another location within range that anyone can go through at any time. It sounds kind of dumb at first, but it lets you pull off some pretty wacky stunts in the game, and I've taken it on every character I've made so far. There are of course tons of other abilities that can be fueled by source points, far too many to list them all here, as each class has a few ""Ultimate"" abilities that you need source to use. But if you're interested in learning more about these godlike powers, then just look up a class guide and check out their abilities to get an idea of what you can work with!  Alright, well I think that if you've read everything I've said so far, that you'll get the idea I'm trying to tell you. The game's fantastic, and fun to play, especially with friends. One of the best campaigns we had was one where the entire party split up and fought to become the ultimate character. So if you enjoy shennanigans like that, and you love the sound of this game, then take a go at it! I really think that you'll enjoy the hell out of it!"

Fairly difficult! Full of variety! Good amount of (literal) replay value!  My friend and I have been going through Hard mode in co-op. Our game's reached the 100 hour mark now and we are at most 3/4 of the way through the game. By comparison, we've finished Original Sin 1 together in 90 hours!  Many changes since the first game, some welcome, some need to grow on you, but at the same time it doesn't feel like a different game. It's still Original Sin.  Certain issues exist, but they're mostly related to design philosophies. So far we've only encountered some minor cosmetic bugs. The type that get fixed when you do a simple reload.  Examples of replay value include:  -Vast increase in difficulty between normal and hard mode. -You can make crazy character builds on Easy and Normal, while focusing on a challenge in Hard. -Permadeath mode. -Playable Undead characters who heal from poison and get damaged by regular heals. -Lone Wolf talent that changes the way you play, makes you stronger but lowers your party size. -A fast and simple mod on the Workshop lets you increase the party size from 4 to 6 or 7. -Potentially even more mods."

There are kings and queens and emperors, and monsters and villains and heros and gods, and things going on over here and over there while I'm doing my thing.  Most current RPGs make it really hard for me to imagine myself as taking part in the story. For DOS2, it takes almost no effort. I really want to know what happened to my characters ancestors, and what my friend wants to do, and what their family is doing, etc. I can make decisions based on how I would react in each situation.  And on top of all of that, they have coop too! Like WTF, they don't know when to stop!  It really feels like a labor of love.
