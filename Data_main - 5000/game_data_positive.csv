Zastier,678,"2,003",32,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,33.4,"Let's see: -Game releases in Early Access with a lot of promise -As it does Larian constantly outdo them selves with updates -They vastly increase the complexity of the AI -Improve the progression in several ways -Give us two well developed and deep extra skill trees -Create a truly grand undead race with interesting mechanics -AGAINST ALL ODD include full voice acting for a game with the amount of dialogue -And include a fully orchestral soundtrack  And the reviews for this masterpiece of a game are going down because some Russians got salty over the translations being delayed a bit. This game lost it's Overwhelmingly Positive rating simply because they didn't manage to translate all of the 80,000 or so lines of dialogue in time for the release. Seriously.  EDIT: To everyone asking, the game is FULLY voice acted, every NPC, no matter how insignificant has a voice. That is somewhere in the area of 80,000 voices lines, where a lot had to be recorded 8 times for each one of the player voices."
Rojigami,214,690,17,"October 25, 2017",Recommended,237.1,"This game is the greatest middle finger to all the money-grubbing AAA games out there. It's reasonably priced, it's intelligent, it gives freedom to your epic adventure, and last but not least, this game doesn't have any loot-box and micro-transaction nonsense!  Great work Larian Studios. This game will go down as a cult classic!!"
Lost Sinner,79,518,12,"August 15, 2017",Recommended,"2,780.1","‚ô¶ One of the best cRPG out there, if you are a fan of roleplaying games, this is definitely a must buy. For those who never play thier first game, no worries, although they take places in a same universe, each has a standalone story. This one starts thousand years after the first one so you are not missing anything.  ‚ô¶ One of best thing about DOS 2 is it gameplay. It's turn-based, slow-paced but really interactive with many different elemental combinations, cool interactions between each abilities and your surrounding environmental even statuses are interesting.   For some examples you can create some nasty chain explosive reactions with a combo of Fire and Poison, any kind of liquid (water/blood/poison/...) left on the battleground can reacted to Air turning it into a pool of Electricity deal damage and stun anyone in it.    Buffs/debuffs status usually do more than one thing and may interact with eachother, Stone Armor not only increase your physical armor but also stop you from bleeding/burning because you are solid rock. Peace Of Mind is the kind of ability that let you see a bigger pictures, it provides stats buff and cure Blindness BUT also remove frenzy status Rage, because the target have become more wise so no more bold actions. Rage on the otherhand is also another status which increase damage output but at a great cost of defense down.   Surrounding environmental also plays a great part in your game, say if someone go invisible and there is happen to be raining, that sneaky guy will be revealed because he's wet. And because water react violently with electricity, he will be taking increased Air damage but will take less damage if you throw a fireball at him. Walking through frozen ground and you may trip and get knocked down. Standing on high ground will make your spells/abilities/items reach further with increased damage. ‚ô¶ Talents in game open up your playstyles depend on what you pick. Lone Wolf or One Man Army does what it says for who want to go solo, Leech turn you into a vampire allowing you to heal when standing near blood or Zombie make Poison heal you instead but normal healing will damage you. Because the game is classless , you can be anyone , mix and match anything you like, you may be born a warrior but dream to be a mage, go learn some magic and become a battlemage. Who says warrior can't be sneaky, go ahead and get yourself some rogue abilities...  ‚ô¶ Divinity Original Sin 2 also offer you really great roleplaying experience, it has a great balance between combat and talking with rich dialogues and occasional silly humors. You can play as different races: Human , Elf , Dwarf , Undead and Lizard..yeah thats' right, you can become a Lizard that spits out Fire. Each races have different racial skill and special power, NPCs may also react/talk differently to you depend on your race. There are also different original characters ingame who have thier own story, goals and personalites for you to play, but if you want to create your own character, the game also offer many different origins which called tags: Soldier, Scholar, Outlaw,..etc which plays a part in dialogue. The Origins will remain in your game as companion and you can have different perspective on them through dialogues/questline which is really cool imo,  there is also a relationship system ingame (not fully included in EA , will be in full game) which can create intense rivalry, friendship, enmity and romance!  ‚ô¶ Visually, the game looks great, it's colorful most of the times and can be dark when needed to be, infact the DOS 2 is meant to be darker and much more focused than the previous one. Having finished Act 1 in EA, there are no fetch quests and unrelated to the storyline, all of them is connected one way or another, each tell you a story about the game's world and ultimately leading to a bigger picture. You can finish quests in different ways , any path is a progression, you'll never feel getting stuck, there are always different paths to take, things to do. Oh a maze, i'm not in the mood to solve puzzle atm, let's jump/fly through it, dont have wings? Look around, there's maybe some other hidden paths/shortcut or go do some questline maybe some of them will shed some lights of the Maze making it easier to go through.  ‚ô¶ Crafting is in game (duh..! obviously, it's an cprg game) and it's RICH. Just look up the crafting list in DOS 1, and  before there were just a combination of two items, in DOS 2 you can have a combination of total 5 items. Here comes the great part, you can craft new skills by combining books of different schools. You can turn a normal rain into a mean blood storm. Mixing a Pryo spell with Necromancy, you can make corpses explode dealing massive damage to nearby targets as if you cutting thier buddies down wasn't enough..  ‚ô¶ There are alot more cool features ingame but i won't include them all in this small review. So i'll add one more thing that may get some people excited: There will be a Game Master Mode! which have up to 5 players in total which include 4 main players and 1 GM. Allowing you to create your own worlds and adventure with friends, the devs also offer alot of tools for easier time making your own dungeon, you can control anything, the stats, the weather, music, dialouges, events,..etc and you can even do it on the fly! You can take a quick look of the mode here (a GM Mode game hosted by Matt Mercer)  ‚ô¶ If you are interested in some gameplays, feel free to check my videos: Honour Mode Walkthrough "
Wren,380,272,9,January 4,Recommended,100.6,"Mind = Blown Divinity: Original Sin 2 is easily my top game of 2017, and probably up there in my list of most favorite games of all time. My mind was completely blown every step of the way through this fantastic journey, start to finish.   Positives+ You do ùòØùò∞ùòµ need to play its predecessor to understand what's going on in this title. + That voice acting. Every line. Every banter. Even the narration when nothing needs to be said between characters. It's fantastic. + A beautifully detailed, living world. You can see how much love and work when into this. So much to explore, so much to see. So many little secrets tucked away here and there. Not to mention while in combat, every single turn needs to be thought out depending on the enviroment around you.  + The assortment of items, weapons and armor is definitely not lacking.  + The ability to freely make your own ""class"" for yourself and your companions. Mix and match whatever skills you want. Whatever suits your playstyle. If you want a Skeleton guy to be your main healer with Necromancy, then do it! + I finished the game on the easiest difficulty in about 85-90 hours, give or take. And that's without finishing all the side quests or companion quests. The amount of content stuffed into this game will leave you plenty to do. + Co-op. Yes. You can play the entire game start to finish with a friend, with a few friends, with strangers. It doesn't matter.  + Dungeon Master mode. Does creating entire campaigns like Dungeons and Dragons appeal to you? Then heck yes! I never really took much time to dabble in it, but I can see the appeal to it. + Replayability. This is huge for me. So many choices that will leave you wondering ""what if I had done this differently?""   Negatives- It's been a fair bit since I played, but I had an issue finishing a companion quest that was tied into the same NPC as another companion I had. Once completed, one companion was stuck and could not progress. I ended up finishing the game without completing it. - A few bugs here and there but nothing gamebreaking. Most notably in ""The Arx"". There was one house with locked doors in which you could run right through them. - I noticed here and there a fair bit of an FPS drop in combat when my screen is exploding with spell effects.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is unforgiving, doesn't coddle and definitely doesn't hold your hand, but taking the time to learn the combat system and all the little bits and pieces is worth every penny from your wallet and every second of your time."
ProfessorButts,111,489,9,"June 5, 2017",Recommended,165.6,"You will love this game if... - You like games that don't hold your hand - You like games that allow you freedom to customise your characters and experiences - You like games that TRULY reward exploration and investigation *Legit, if you don't sit there scrolling over the map looking for hidden chests, ladders, ledges, etc, you're doing it wrong* - You like high strategy, turn based combat that rewards forward thinking and planning - You like finding, using, selling or collecting loot - You have 1 or more friends that will play with you. This game shines in multiplayer  The handful of little annoying bugs and glitches are completely and utterly outweighed by how captivating and enthralling this game is... And it's still in Early Access... I see a lot of complaints that the story isn't long enough, or really focusing on the bugs, lets get real.  Bugs: - Sometimes your helmet will blink and flicker a bit - Sometimes your characters won't be within range, or have line of sight on a target they clearly should - Accuracy percentage seems to be a bit off, 80% chance to hit is more like 30%; anything under 90% is trouble That's... About it...  Story is too short? Well then play the rest of the game kid. You can speed run the ""story"" in like 20 minutes if you wanted, the real fun comes from exploring the world and finding everything else there is to do. I honestly can't believe how good this game is for an EA release and I can't wait for the full release come September. Could not recommend highly enough.  Things I would like to see in future: - More races. - More in depth customisation options for spells and abilities. Think Champions Online or the Oblivion Spell-Creation. (asking for a lot, I know) - A little control over what armour looks like on your character.  - More spells, more synergy between spells. This is already great, but why stop at great! The more points I list, the more I realise I'm just asking for more of the game. Give me more of the game mate."
Purrmaid,650,401,5,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,149.3,"It seems I've never written a review for D:OS2, and with the Steam Awards wanting us to update a review, I might as well!  Let me start by stating that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is my all time favorite game. I adored the first one. I'm worshippping the second.  This isn't a game that'll hold your hand, this isn't a game that's easy and laid back. This is the game that throws you in the middle of a world and tells you to figure it out.   It has multiple difficulty settings, so if tactical turnbased combat isn't your strongest suit there ARE easier modes for you! But the harsh combat isn't the only thing that makes this game hard. It's the quests, the world, there is NO handholding. You got to figure out what to do, you got to figure out which quest to solve and focus on. And boy are there many quests to focus on!  Some seem absolutely random, some seem like just a typical sidequest kind of job that ends up being the key ingredient in solving the big mystery! I love that, I love that the first act has you stuck on an island, a jail, and your job is to break out. And how would one do this? There isn't just one way, or two, or three. There are more than that. Way more. And it's up to you to figure out the way.   There are five races, human, dwarf, elf, lizard, and undead. Each brings with their own talents and experience in the game. You might have trouble with certain quests because they hate your race, you might need to find another way into a town because they don't like dwarves. It's extremely immersive, and playing it as a coop makes it even so.   I'm not sure I have words to describe to you how amazing this game is. I like difficult games, I played this on Tactical, which is hard, and on some boss fights me and my coop partner would sit here for two hours. Reloading. Repositioning. Changing skills. Reloading. over and over untill we finally managed to beat said boss. It was one of the most amazing experiences I've had in gaming all year. Just that little bit of having to figure out how something works.  There are Character Tags and Talents that you can choose that really makes this into an immersive rpg. Pet Pal allows you to talk to animals. That sad dog over there, cheer him up and he'll help you. That nasty fire elemental? Guess what! She needs your help! You can have a talent that makes you stink, and people dislike you because of it.   Larian Studios is a dev team to follow. I cannot wait to see what comes next. (Voice acting wasn't in the original budget. There was partial voice acting, but somehow they managed to make the entire game voice acted, without starting another kickstarter and without pushing the game back a few months. It was a surprise untill launch and I give them major props for doing this)"
PixelGrotto,150,144,39,March 2,Recommended,136.9,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is like playing a very enthusiastic Dungeon Master's homebrew campaign. Said DM really fell in love with the cosmology and deities section of the Dungeon Master's Guide as well as the idea of creating an epic, REALLY LONG arc where his players eventually achieve godhood. Mr. DM also put an awful lot of time into fleshing out his world and making sure you know that HIS elves are DIFFERENT (they EAT people and get their MEMORIES, see), though for some reason he decided to keep his dwarves Scottish.  This DM is not perfect and has his faults. For one, he really loves throwing environmental effects all over the battlefield to the point of it becoming annoying. Fire spreads 50 feet in an arc! Now ice shoots out over the fire! Now smoke and lighting and tentacles spread atop the fire and ice! Yeah! Near the end of the campaign, his planning starts to slip, both in combat design and in lore. For instance, he offers his players a variety of different endings to their grand adventure, but none of them are all that great, and one gets the feeling that he randomly chose the final boss by just flipping through the Monster Manual with the intent of picking a Challenge Rating 30 beastie just to tell his other DM friends that ""I PUT MY PLAYERS UP AGAINST THIS GUY ONCE AND THEY KIND OF SURVIVED!""   After playing for nearly 140 hours, though, none of his players can say it wasn't an epic time at the table. They'll probably be back for more.  BTW, Mr. DM - Lohse was the best character you created."
Genky,186,175,0,"February 5, 2017",Recommended,131.4,"What can I say ... This is Belgium's jewel in the gaming industry. The kind of game developer we need more of.  More content, more polished and more fun than any triple A game developer will give you, at 2/3 the price and no hundreds of holes to add paid content later. Even in the Early Access phase this is already more polished than most games are 3 months after official launch.  The game itself: It's the original + improved and better in every single way. Graphics look great and the engine is very well optimized (already). The combat and progression system is very well done and fun. Multiplayer even better integrated than the original. Storyline and characters are interesting and well written. The music, I absolutely love it. Affordable.  Even if you fear the Early Access tag, just buy this if you're into this type of games at all, you won't be disappointed and you'll actually be supporting a developer that delivers and makes games for the gamers, not for mass revenue. (Of course they're a business in it for profit too, but there's a difference between 45 euro for a full game and 60 euro for a game with 10 strategically placed holes for paid DLC, pushed into release with game breaking bugs. Larian Studios actually ditched their publisher and switched to crowd funding because they forced them to make and launch the game the way they didn't want it, that should tell you enough.)  Larian Studios, as a Belgian, I can say you make us proud. Please keep doing what you're doing, never succumb to the attitude most major developers and publishers have, it'd be a huge loss in the game industry."
VAC in time by Hubert Lewis,229,395,24,January 22,Recommended,49.9,Blah blah blah best RPG literally of the past 10 years blah blah blah.  Here's What Matters. You can literally do anything and the game is prepared for all of it. Pay Full Price. Games like this don't happen enough.
Surplus Cyborg,103,"1,001","1,543","November 16, 2017",Recommended,91.6,Talked to a chicken that claimed he was a mighty wizard. Called him a liar. The chicken teleported me to the other side of the continent. Had to walk back to the rest of my party. Serves me right for doubting the mighty magic chicken. This game is awsome.
Zorao,340,242,5,"November 4, 2017",Recommended,80.6,"This game is a masterpiece. Easily one of the best games I ever played in my life.   The gear is very rewarding, you notice your characters actually develop and become way stronger with each level and each new gear equipment.   The story is rich and the voice acting makes it really helpful if you don't like reading dialogues. You can play the game multiple times and you would have a different experience each time you play it.   Try to get some friends to play with you, they can either help you or turn against you. For example your friend could tell the guards that you stole something and they will put you in jail!. or you can make your friend distract traders and you pickpocket them.   I really recommend this game."
Zahbuhdoo,459,269,2,"September 20, 2017",Recommended,178.7,"If you like turn-based RPG's with lots of customization and a good story to put along with them, do yourself a favor and buy this game. This game will leave you wanting more every time you put it down. Choices matter. Characters are interesting. Combat is fluid. This is one of the better, if not best, Turn-Based RPG's out there.   Side Note: Larian Studios has shown how much they care about the content they put out by giving you the best they can offer. Did you notice the price tag isn't $60? Did you notice the Divine Edition is only $15 but not at all game-changing or content locking from the base game? Did you notice the Game Master Mode wasn't a purchasable DLC? That is humility right there. They aren't trying to squeeze every last person for some money. They are looking to create quality content so that we can enjoy it at, for what you're buying, an extremely generous price. They knew the fan-base and what people wanted and how bad they wanted it. They still did not take advantage of us. Larian Studios has earned my undying support."
Dracknov,154,518,7,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,271.9,"I was tired of games that only tests your reaction skill. I was tired of games that say it's 60 dollars, only to have randomized loot boxes or micro-transaction implemented later in time. I was tired of games that were advertised to be wide as an ocean but ended up being shallow like a puddle.   Then Divinity Original Sin 2 came out. Each encounter is well executed and designed flawlessly. Enemy design  is varied and leaves my friend and I saying ""WTF is that!?"" often. Every time my friend finds some epic loot, we cannot wait to identify it to see who can make use of the item. Quests are a joy to do and often leads you to find more quests that's filled with important decision making. Every choice you make has an impact on the world and I have been sent to jail multiple times for making the wrong decision. For $44.99 you are not buying a game but an experience. An experience to truly go on an epic adventure. Fights are never easy but once you learn the satisfaction of besting the enemy combatant that you failed to take down multiple times, you are left leaving for more glory. (Currently playing on Tactician Mode)   I am not sure if anyone is going to read this review since this is my very first review with a positive rating (My other review is for Fallout 4 CREATION CLUB so you already know what rating I gave) but if you are looking for a game with challenge, depth, and quality give this game a try. I have been playing this game for over 102 hours and I have a feeling that this is only the beginning."

I don't go a single moment in this game without being mesmerized by how fantastic it is.  I'll list some pros:  -Beautiful art style, everything looks amazing.  -Combat that is both simple and incredibly difficult at the same time. After two-to-three encounters the player will have a good grasp of how combat works, but throughout the entire game they'll be learning new ways to manipulate the environment and their abilities to play better.  -Fantastic writing, honestly amazing.  -Perfect soundtrack, every sound and song in this game is so perfectly adjusted for the situation it's seamless and very immersive.  -Highly addictive, once I sit down to play I'm practically rooted to my chair to continue.  -Companions you'll care about, it's the tragedy of lesser RPGs that your companions are boring and lifeless, but here, everyone has their own ambitions and goals, and WILL pursue them.    There's very little wrong about this game. Previously I mentioned that voice acting won't be included which would be a con to some, but in a complete surprise Larian have voiced the entire game, despite the fact that was never planned throughout development.  Highly recommend purchasing it, you really can't go wrong on this purchase."
üëåm8,102,179,25,February 15,Recommended,231.8,"Most Animals in Modern RPGs:  ‚ñ´ [Player]: *clicks cat* ‚ñ´ [Cat]: *meow sound* ‚ñ´ *end dialogue* Divinity: Original Sin 2:  ‚ñ´ [Player with Pet Pal skill]: *clicks cat* ‚ñ´ [Narrator]: As you approach a stray cat, it looks up to you with its pupils thin as a needle... ‚ñ´ [Cat]: 'TIS A TERRIBLE DAY, INNIT? ‚ñ´ *shows dialogue options* Divinity: Original Sin 2 has reached new heights of what it is to be expected on huge Indie Games. Made by Larian Studios, it was able to level with AAA games that it even surpasses the standards, regardless of its flaws.  You'll play as your own character in the story, and embark on a journey towards the world of Rivellon as you find the answer to the cause of the Void's awakening. You could also play as one of the six main characters with their own unique story if character creation is not your thing.  Also, quicksaving before doing anything else is a must. Talk to someone, quicksave first. Interacting an item, quicksave first. Opening a door, quicksave. After an autosave, quicksave.  REVIEW The game is very similar to its previous title, Divinity: Original Sin (DOS1). There may be changes, but there's nothing too drastic as far as I've observed.   STORYDOS2 moved towards a more interesting Plot. While it still does have DOS1's lighthearted ""HaHa""s, the studio was able to put the humor at the right spot. In a way, they're able to make a decently captivating tale for an RPG. What's so interesting about the plot's flow is that the game doesn't make you feel like you need to save the world because when you want to go somewhere, doing so will progress your main story. The linearity is barely present that I didn't even know which quest I should keep my focus on my first playthrough.   It's quite unfortunate, for me at least, how the game treats the Party Interaction on the whole story as it progresses because it had less... interaction. Back in DOS1's party interaction, you're able to choose a dialogue for everyone. DOS2 removed that feature and only allows you to choose a dialogue for your main character only; however, in turn they added an Attitude system, so your party members and everyone else in the game have their own morals and beliefs. In the end, it sadly lowers the replayability. GAMEPLAYOn the matter of the game's Quest System, I become lost throughout my first playthrough. Given that most of your progress relates to the main story, a quest that I've ignored for an in-game day (since I'm focusing on a particular quest at that time) suddenly updates along with the quest I'm currently taking. There are some cases during an update to my current quest, a new quest opens up in my journal. In a long run, the quest log became flooded to a point that I don't know which quest would I continue.  The turn-based Combat System is really great. Given how there's hundreds of skills and hardly countable ways of killing an enemy, the fact that good positioning actually gives an advantage, it's hard to get bored of it. Unlike many turn-based games, the Original Sin series shines on how your surroundings affect you and your enemy's strategy. The lit torch stand, the oil puddle poured near an explosive barrel, the sea shore, everything is interactive. In DOS2, the height advantage was a great addition.  The game's Challenge is the one that sparks its replayability. It's not just how unfair some items/skills are, it's the moment when the AI actually knows how, where, and when to use the environment and situation to their advantage. Once you've come up with a different build, their playstyle changes. They are annoyingly smart that sometimes they're three turns ahead of you if you're not aware enough.  Carelessly set a trap mine near an enemy, one of them will then teleport you on top of it. Enemies even face behind a wall just so your Rogue character can't backstab him/her. Although, there is a time when a hazardous area is too wide, the AI keeps on walking around the said area until they die instead of just standing still. It has its awful moments sadly. AESTHETICSComparing the two of the series, DOS2 was able to utilize more graphical features which made it far more detailed than DOS1. It shifted from a cartoony colorful vibe into a more realistic and bleak environment. Even so, the Graphics were decent at best.   The Music score is an improvement from the previous title. Just comparing the two themes, you could say that they have more budget this time haha. It's interesting how you could select your character's instrument theme, so you could hear a particular instrument on certain occasions depending on what you chose for one of your characters. As much as how catchiness goes however, it's not as grand as what I always hear from Bioware and Bethesda games. For short, DOS2's music is ingenuinely good.  Sample OST I personally liked: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxuC0i5S_LE For a game that lacks flashy CGI cinematics, they were able to compensate it with the expressive Voice Dialogues. You've gotta hand it to the voice actors and scriptwriters for making their characters and npcs feel alive. It's interesting how most of them have something to say inside and outside of the conversation. FEATURESFor a turn-based game, the Playability is good. Besides the 4 player multiplayer, there's couch co-op and controller support. The game is playable in any way but 3-4 splitscreen multiplayer, yet it's still rare to find such accessibility this time around in video games.  Game Master Mode is a cool feature that you can't believe it's included on the standard game. Though, I'm not fond of Dungeons and Dragons, it really seems that's what it's trying to make out of this game mode. In my case, this is a casual DnD that includes the game's character abilities and such. An interesting mode to say the least.  Arena Mode is a decent feature if you're up for some PvP duels. Besides the fact that you could play online, there's an offline mode called Hot Seat where you and your fellow players play in one device.  Lastly, this game has the Classic Edition (CE) which removes tons of new dialogues and enemy encounters along with the updated User Interface for controller users from the Definitive Edition.

Divinity 2 rarely presents you with black and white moral choices, and a simple slip of the tongue will see you losing loved ones fast.  The combat is challenging, in a good way. It allows you to customize your party completely and make logical and creative decisions in combat that you don't really expect to work but then they totally have an effect you weren't expecting....  ...that is why this game is perfection. Every time I pushed at the borders of the game to see if I could get away with something, I realised the border wasn't there... so I pushed harder and got more creative...  I have a man who can speak to Animals and I highly suggest you take the Perk that allows this ASAP in game because it opens up a huge depth to storyline. I now treat Chickens and Squirrels with the same respect as I do any other NPC. I speak to the ghosts of the dead and they present me with A LOT of moral decisions.   How far will you spin your moral compass to become Godly powerful? Who will you grow close to only to realise that at any moment they might stab you in the back or even worse... that you will have to choose to lose for the sake of the greater good?  14/10 would sneak a peek at Lizard Royalty having sex in a caravan again x"
Bee,130,104,9,June 24,Recommended,436.2,"After hitting over 400 hours in Divinity: Original Sin 2, I feel like I can finally review it in full depth.  The game is spectacular. It was everything I wanted from Original Sin and then more.   The quests are in-depth, and you feel the consequences of your character/race choices on top of the dialogue you pick. I've played four full playthroughs, and each one I was still finding things I had missed (and I'm sure I will find more in my next one). The story is just fantastic, I couldn't ask for more from a storyline. The game makes you want to read every little lore book and just learn more and more about anything and everything going on. And if you're an Original Sin fan, there's little pieces of lore left around everywhere for you to prick your ears up at and get excited about (and then some!).   Then there's the combat. It's fantastic. It's incredibly strategic in every aspect. Your first playthrough on Tactician will give you some good laughs at some of the difficulty you need to face and work around (this is a good thing! My boyfriend and I faced some extremely hilarious moments of trying to figure out a fight and failing miserably when we were learning the game, it was amazing fun). And then you enter the realm of searching out perfect gear, perfect min-maxing, perfect stats, and perfect combat. That, in itself, is the most enjoyable aspect of the combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2. You can hop from easier combat to the most intense combat the game offers, and it's all fun. I recently finished my solo Honour Mode, and it was definitely hard and an adventure and left me sitting during quite a few fights thinking out beforehand how I was going to handle them because even the smallest mistake can mess you up. I can go on and on about how amazing the combat is, but you really just need to delve into it yourself to truly see how remarkable it is. I can't find anything I enjoy as much as D:OS2's combat system anywhere else.  If you're looking for a game to literally lose yourself in for long periods of time, or to even play casually in your free time, this is definitely my go-to. This is just a masterpiece of a game, it's every fantasy and rpg player's dream come true. And did I mention the co-op is incredibly fun? Really, it's just a stunning piece of art.  Now, I have a great many pros for D:OS2, but I do have a few cons, and these are entirely subjective, and my own personal opinion.  I really don't enjoy the four-man party system. For someone like me, it's way too overwhelming managing four characters at all times, and I just don't like it. Because some best in slot gear pieces are unique and you won't find ANYTHING else with their bonuses on in the game (Second Skin, ihu), you're just sacrificing too much playing a full four-man. But that's from a min-maxing perspective, and probably not that important to others. The second part of why I don't like the four-man parties is because once you get a taste of the solid power of a Lone Wolf character, you really can't ever go back. Now this can be a good or bad thing. It gives the game a lot of replayable value, I'm about to hit my 5th playthrough and I'm finally needing to stray away from my babe Sebille ( ): ), which pushes me to pick other players to experience their stories.   With all that being said, this is definitely a game I recommend anyone to buy. It's amazing in every aspect. I absolutely cannot wait until the Definitive Edition either. And big, big props to Larian Studios for their choice to give the buyers of D:OS2 the Definitive Edition for free. Incredible company who listens to their audience. I can't wait to see what future games come!"

Zant,142,139,15,June 3,Recommended,180.9,"I cannot recommend this game enough. It is an RPG that breaks the boundaries of what you perceive an RPG to be. Every problem or puzzle has what feels like more solutions than you can conceive of. Original Sin 2 rewards clever thinking, tactics, and the role-playing itself over all else. Stat building and creating the ""perfect character"" is always a fun aspect of CRPGs but I'd say it's not the main focus here. Don't get me wrong, there are tons of numbers and plenty to min-max, but at the end of the day, it doesn't matter how much damage you do if you're not in combat, and the game truly shines when you can avoid it.  Don't get me wrong, the combat in this game is fantastic. You can control all of your (up to 4) party members individually outside of combat and prepare the upcoming battlefield to your liking assuming you have the drop on your opponents. Place your archers up top, give your wizards ample space, have clean terrain for your warriors, e.t.c. However, when you find yourself able to circumvent combat, you'll be rewarded with a level of satisfaction very rare in games these days.  It constantly feels like Original Sin 2 almost dares you to break the game's boundaries. It challenges you to out-think the developers. Everything matters in this game. I'll leave you with an anecdote:  As I explored, searching for a quest target, I came upon a ruin. I saw a passage through, but in between it and myself were a few foes I was most certainly not equipped to handle at my current level. In other games I'd probably have left and came back later when I was a higher level, but not here. I navigated around the edges of the NPCs' detection radius in stealth with each of my characters individually until I found a minuscule spot I could teleport to that would get me past my foes. It was certainly inconvenient, but it worked - I painstakingly teleported each of my characters in turn to that one spot only to realize the one doing the teleporting was stuck below; the one casting the spell is unable to use it on themselves. After some hard thought I realized I could place the teleportation artifact close enough for my previously transported characters to grab. I then used it to pull my last hero past the baddies. I exhaled a sigh of relief and then panned the camera to see I had just come face-to-face with the very character I had been trying to track down. I was positively oozing with smugness."

It's significantly better than the first, which I found enjoyable but didn't fall in love with.  It had so much potential, but never really seemed to get there.  This gets there - right away.

saturn missiles,183,253,2,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,341.5,"Simply put, Divinity: Original Sin 2 expands on the best ideas from the first game while taking a complete 180 in tone to deliver a much darker and adult experience compared to the first.  One of the most notable changes is immediately realized as character creation begins, with races, tags, origin stories, and a complete stat revamp giving a new level of depth to character creation. The origin story presets, while not customizable, deliver a unique experience for each. All of the notable ""origin story"" characters have interactions with each other, and even if you choose not to create them yourself, they can be found and interacted with around the world. Not only this, but you can recruit these important figures of the lore. Origin stories on the surface level seem gimmicky, but allow for a whole new level of replayability, in combination with the tag system. The tag system allows you to acquire new tags that effect quests and dialogue as you progress through the game, or assign them to your custom character in character creation. ""Origin story"" characters will have these tags preset, as well as a brief synopsis of their lore.   However, the changes aren't just to the character creation. As soon as you get into combat, you'll quickly notice how much has changed. While Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps the basics of the first game intact, action points have recieved a complete overhaul, streamlining the process of choosing actions. While the new system (6 action points total; 4 action points at the start of encounter. Most skills cost 1-2 action points) may seem to cater to a more casual audience at first, the new skills that accompany this revamp allow for a level of complexity in combat never before seen in the Divinity series. New skills introduced in the second game are more ambitious, creative, and innovative than any in the first game. Even from the start of the game, you'll acquire interesting abilities that you can use to control the battlefield. The new targeting system provided in D:OS2 gives a sense of clarity lacking in the first game. Height advantages and disadvantages means that positioning matters now more than ever before. In addition to the ""surfaces"" system of the first game (fire, poison, poison clouds, static clouds, electrified water, etc), most of these surfaces can now be blessed and cursed for interesting variations and choice in combat. For example, while fire is harmful to your team, if you bless it, it'll apply a heal every turn and prevent the members within from being frozen.   The campaign here is of absolutely astounding quality and length - my first full playthrough of the game took roughly 80 hours, even without dozens of sidequests. No matter your choice of origin character or custom, you'll find the campaign to be deeply satisfying. However, as noted by the developers, you are meant to play with the origin story characters - and it shows. Each origin character has at least half a dozen unique encounters. While the game is still engaging if you're playing as a custom character, the origin stories really do allow for a better capacity for role playing and it's interaction in the game world.  For the Steam Awards of 2016, this is my pick for the Most Astounding Game. The staggering amount of interactions in the game, even in alpha, can be overwhelming. Divinity: Original Sin 2 could very well shape up to be Game of the Year 2017 for me."

The way spells and combat with your party work together is just amazing. It really opened my eyes and maybe once I am done with this one I will go back and play the first. Might do that now that there is a sale!  The story is well done so far and writing is top notch. Graphics are nice and the world seems so alive. So many side quests I am still in the first area.    Performance is great, I am getting solid FPS (between 80-120) all settings maxed out in 1440. The soundtrack is great as well.

Ex Nihiloish,295,"2,143",827,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,220.5,"I'm 72 years old and these have been the best 20 hours of my life.  EDIT:: After playing through the game multiple times, including finishing it on Honour Mode, I have to say that my opinion of this game is even higher than it was after those first 20 hours. After finishing this game, it feels like my life is complete and there's nothing left to live for. This may be the last game I ever play and review I ever write. I would like to thank Larian for filling a void that has been plaguing me for more than half a century.  I found the main story as well as every single side quest/story to be fun and interesting. There are no boring fetch quests as far as I can tell. How you handle side quests and whether you complete them or not 'does' affect the ending; as such, they could be considered extensions of the main story. (You could be unsatisfied with the ending if you just rush through and skip things.)  You can build your characters any way you see fit and almost any build is completely viable. If you don't like the way you built your characters, just wait until you complete Act 1 and you can rebuild them any way you want as frequently as you want all the way up to the very end of the game; this is very good for testing new things out. By the end of the game my main character was a fire breathing Geo/Pyro battle mage that wielded a fire staff, used Warfare skills and showered my enemies in meteors with some necromancy for physical damage in case the enemy had too much resistance to those elements; she was pretty godly. I plan on trying a solo Honour mode run next with a similar but more diverse build. (I love the lizards!)  For me, the best part of this game is the combat. It's extremely well done and very fun. I can't really say any more than what the other reviews cover though. Just know that if a fight seems absolutely impossible, that it really isn't. I've gone into fights where half my party was annihilated before I got to do anything, yet I still emerged victorious. There's always a way to win even if the enemy has you outnumbered and outleveled; just gotta think!  Like many reviews state, there are still some bugs. As far as I can tell, they are all minor. After multiple play throughs on multiple difficulties I have not experienced any major bugs. Nothing game breaking and nothing that really affected my gameplay much.  The few bugs I've experienced:  - Many unvoiced lines in Arx.  - Incorrect journal entries.  - Sometimes a character would act blind in combat even though they weren't (could't use any ranged skills, couldn't see around themselves, but this was rare and only lasted a single turn.)  - Sometimes the enemy AI would derp out and they'd just run around or repeatedly climb up and down a ladder until they were out of AP.  - Custom undead characters do not receive the appropriate immunities, such as bleeding and suffocation. (though I don't recall any of my characters ever being afflicted with Bleed...) (Fane does receive these immunities)  - Undead afflicted with Decay will not attempt to avoid poison puddles (Not sure if this is a bug or an oversight).  - Altitude does not affect many player or enemy melee attacks. (Entities 10+ meters above can be struck with melee.) But it does affect some skills, such as Dragon's Blaze, Laser Ray, charging skills, Battle Stomp, etc.  ... I think that's about it. I'll add more if I remember them.  Some reviews complain about enemies being omniscient and knowing all of your strengths and weaknesses (including whether you're undead or not), which is true, but it's also true for players. Any player with Loremaster on one of their characters can examine any NPC or enemy to gain insight into their strengths and weaknesses. Only one of your characters needs Loremaster. If you examine with someone that doesn't have it, they use the skill level of whoever does, even if that person is dead. (This even works on the final boss, at no point in the game is it unfair that enemies can spot your weaknesses.)  So in summary, very fun game, great character customization, great combat, good story, a few minor bugs. It can be challenging in some scenarios but it's supposed to be; that's at least half the fun. I could mention the poor inventory management but countless reviews already cover that.  Tip: Carry a couple pieces of +Thievery and +Loremaster gear with you to make sure you can pick any lock and identify any item. There may be times when your base skill isn't sufficient.   TL;DR: Recommended, as shown above. 10/10 on the Completely Subjective, Arbitrary and Useless rating system."
TeaBagTom,146,63,1,"September 28, 2016",Recommended,68.3,"Ok...so beat act 1, and holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•larian out did themselves. Everything from the atmosphere to the character building has been improved, using the same formula as before and making every aspect better. The combat is the same style but with many subtle at first differences that expand into a lot more combat flexibility.   Update (Release): The game has finally released and I really have to say...Larian has out-done themselves. Playing through the game on Tactician and seeing how the AI does its best to break the combat system like a real player would, ending their turn with their back to a wall so your rogue is inefective, reversing your moves by throwing water on the enemy you just shocked and stunning your entire party, it's an incredible system that Larian has created so much flexibility, every move of every fight becomes a question of ""did that just happen? can I really do this?"" which is something no other game can capture.  Gone are the supercharged ridiculous characters of the first game, replaced with smarter and more adept enemies that force you to make better decisions. The flexibility in character creation and the much more intuitive world makes me excited every chance I get to jump on and uncover just a bit more of the world. The inclusion of a darker story and races adds a much needed party diversity and the lore being less silly pulls you in far more to the atmosphere (which is beautiful...from the musical score to the graphics) creating a much more enjoyable transition from combat to exploring, and giving you more to WANT to explore.   The beautiful score and excellent voice acting talent (so far) has been an incredible treat in an age when games have been spending less and less time and devotion to world building and character development. The party while smaller than some CRPGs, is fully fleshed out with interesting characters who I actually want to talk to and interact with.  So far I am incredibly excited with the release and looking forwarding to simply getting through ACT 1 on tactician and exploring the unknown. Well done Larian, you have brought art back into the gaming industry."
AKatarzynaK,681,152,4,"October 21, 2017",Recommended,114.5,"This is without a doubt one of the best RPGs I have ever played and after completing it I can honestly say it has secured its place among my top favorite games of all time.   When beginning the game you have the option of creating your own character or choosing from one of several premade characters, each with their own unique backstories and questlines. I highly recommend going this route as these characters and their quests are very well written and interesting. I found myself extremely invested in my main character (Lohse) and what would become of her and her companions. It's also really interesting witnessing the members of your party, each with their own motivations and biases, try to work together while also clashing as they look out for their own best interests. Each character is so well written and perfectly voice acted that it really helped make what is already such an immersive game feel even more alive. The dialogue is great, whether it be the main characters or random NPCs, it really feels like everyone has their own unique personality.  The gameplay is incredibly fun, and I really can't think of the last time I had such a hard time putting down a game. You are given a lot of freedom, leaving it entirely up to you how you choose to progress throughout the world. There are often numerous ways to complete one task, depending on just how creative or good/evil you want to be. To add to this, the choices you make actually have consequences, and sometimes the line between what is right and what is wrong might not be so clear. So you will sometimes find that a decision you made might come back to haunt you in one way or another. I loved this and it was really cool seeing how some of the choices I made previously came to have a much wider impact than I had originally imagined.  The turn-based combat system is really well done and there are lots of ways in which you can get creative and use the environment to your advantage. Each battle is well designed and interesting, with each type of enemy presenting their own unique strengths and weaknesses. You have to really put some thought into exactly how you design your group, providing for a nice amount of strategy both in and out of battle. If you find that you have messed up your build there is an option to respec, something which I think most of us can appreciate for its ability to save us a lot of wasted time.  It is also worth mentioning that there are quite a few options as far as difficulty. I did my first playthrough on Classic, which is the default difficulty, and found it to be perfect for me. There were a few fights which I struggled on, but anytime I faced such a roadblock I found that all I needed to achieve victory was to simply reevaluate my strategy. Personally I love just how rewarding of a feeling this can be, and I look forward to doing future playthrough on the harder difficulties. However if you're someone who is looking for less of a hassle, you will be happy to find that the lower difficulty, Explorer, will allow you to simply enjoy the ride without any frustration.  The quests are extremely fun and varied, some of which require solving puzzles, riddles, or getting a bit more creative with your abilities and items. One thing I really loved about the quest system is that it doesn't hold your hand, meaning that unlike some RPGs that basically give you a GPS tracker showing you exactly where you need to go, this game tends to just point you in a general direction and expect you to figure it out on your own. Now if this is offputting to you, please know I am speaking as someone with a truly awful sense of direction. I had a ton of fun with this and found that getting lost while trying to find where I needed to go to next provided for some of my favorite moments. Some of the random encounters you come across as you explore are the most surprising and rewarding experiences in the game.   The attention to detail is truly incredible and the world really feels so alive. Even areas that at first glance appear to be devoid of life might have something hidden. Especially with the pet pal ability, which allows you to talk to animals, or spirit vision which allows you to see/speak to ghosts, you'll find that if you look close enough there is no shortage of things to be seen or done. And to top this all off the soundtrack is incredible, providing the perfect music to accompany you on what is truly an epic journey.  The universe that Larian have built here is absolutely astounding and they managed to pack so much into this game that it's honestly a bit overwhelming at times. Between all of the characters and their questlines, the decisions you have to make throughout the game, and the sheer size of the world, it's truly impossible to take it all in on just one run. Speaking as someone who rarely plays games a second time, I'm already gearing up for my second trip into Divinity Original Sin 2 and imagine I'll be making even more eventually.   Now that I've ranted and raved about just how much I adore this game I must point out really the only negative thing I have to say about it, and that is just how buggy it can be. During the course of my 111 hour playthrough I ran into a number of bugs, ranging from mildly annoying to gamebreaking. The biggest one, of course, being the gamebreaking bug which made it impossible for me to enter into a room you need to use to begin the final quest. In order to get around this I had to get a bit creative and basically stack items until I could get one of my characters to glitch into said room, then allowing the rest of my party to teleport to me. While I am obviously pleased that I was able to get past this annoying bug, I can't help but be frustrated that such a problem would even exist in the first place. For as much as I love this game some of the bugs I faced really took away from my overall enjoyment and I truly hope Larian will patch them as soon as possible. Of course I'm sure there are those who played the game without facing bugs, but it doesn't change the fact that I was unfortunate enough to encounter them and that some of you might as well.   Overall I truly love this game and believe it deserves all of the praise it is getting. As I mentioned, my one and only complaint are some of the bugs I encountered. While frustrating, such issues can easily be fixed through a patch. And it does speak to just how captivating I found this game to be that I continued to press on despite these issues. There is absolutely no denying that this was a game crafted with a lot of love, and so I have complete faith that Larian will continue to be very active in it post release. If you're on the fence than I suggest you wait a bit to buy, but I imagine it won't take long for these issues to be fixed. For 45 Euro I managed to get one of the most amazing gaming experiences I have ever had and I encourage everyone who is interested to give it a try. This game is a masterpiece, plain and simple."

It's a bit different than your classic CRPG, the main story doesn't seem that extraordinary, but it grows on you. It's not what makes the game good. The journey is.  - You have multiple ways to achieve things. Want to steal a chest without being seen? Teleport it away from affar. Want to blow up a door but it has too much HP? Blow it up with an explosive barrel.  Want to escape a keep of evil clerics? Well I'll let you figure that one out for yourself, you'll have many ways to chose from. - The voice acting is great considering how little budget they had compared to triple A companies. - Every NPC has something to say.  - The writting is just right, and very immersive. - Remember the combat in Torment:Tides of Numenera? Wipe that nightmare out of your memory with the combat in this game. It's fun, complex and actually makes  you look forward to battles. - Each companion is unique and complex.

Retrotus,222,172,6,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,38.7,"If you want good old classical RPG feel that does not kill your smart with stupid RNG, If you want something that is not just rush in and kill everything and be a godlike all the time, if you really think that games nowadays has made you dumb and numb, then Divinity 2 is for you.  For example my experience so far has been..  I chose tactician difficulty as it said enemies will use tricks that they wont otherwise. i played few hours and was about to lower my difficulty from tactician and now i'm glad that i did not. It really makes you save scumming A LOT, but other hand it forces you to learn some dirty tricks to defeat enemies as they really do some dirty hoccus poccus to you. The difficulty lives by it name 100% in this game imo  It forces you kind a explore world more to find out ways to beat something that serves your royal head in a plate.. And when you do that you find some many interesting stuff from the game world that you would probably just missed. Mostly in other games exploring just feels kind a work but not in this one, it's rewarding  There has been many fights that i had to delay due lvl difference and bad gear, Fights that i need to find an alternative way to approach. Some situations feels so unfair until you really think it through. For me it is just pure joy, wanted so long something that is not just blatant rush in and slice everything or that stupid RNG kills your smart moves, it's you and your stupid moves and strategies what gets you killed.. and ofc i can blame a bit other games that has made your brain so dry for new ideas ;)  Same style goes with conversations. Listen what they have to say, it might help you later.. No it will help you later. Books, notes etc is rewarding to read as they can have life saving info or ways to unlock some puzzles later on. Sometimes even info about NPCs in game world wich you can use to get their favor in conversation. No, the game does not unlock conversation choises when you find info about people. For long time i haven't read so many diaries in game that i have in this game so far! Voice acting is not annoying to listen. DOS1 gave me that feel i was listening shakespeare but in this on they nailed it.  What i can say...  The victory is like drug now,  every nook and corner is my friend,  every item that is not nailed down is my salary or key to success,  every book or note makes me a bit more aware of the world in game. every stronger enemies that slain my team is like tasty revange when you come to beat them later on!  10/10 in my book  PS. if you are new to Divinity Orginal Sin, Tactician difficulty can be a bit harsh first ;)"
Riptide,61,248,8,August 4,Recommended,195.5,"After playing this game for a few weeks, I can say that DOS2 has replaced Skyrim as my all time favorite RPG. It's that good.  Pros: Voice acting, graphics, ""turn based"" combat, immersion factors all get a solid 10. I haven't finished the game, but so far the story is interesting, and even if the story ending stinks, it still has that draw you in factor. As for re-playability, it's already apparent to me that I'll have to play it again with the other available characters so I can experience their stories. There is the main story line, and each of the 5 pre-created characters have their own stories. I chose to create my own character, which means I have 3 of the 5 available pre-created characters as my compatriots, each with their own stories to be completed. With my current playthough, I'm not going to know how Sebille or Lohse's stories finish out. They're not in my party so, I gotta play again with them to find out how their stories end.  An EXTREMELY well crafted RPG. This one is a clear and unmistakable winner. Kudos to Larian for self-publishing to avoid the pressure to release the game before they completed what they intended the game to be. You guys got it correct.  Although I'm not a fan of third person, overlooking the party, view point games (I prefer first person... eyeballs forward),  this one succeeds in grasping my attention and refusing to let it go. I'm drawn in, focused, worried, and sssso happy when a fight is over and all the characters under my control are still alive, I'm almost bouncing up and down in my seat ready for the loot.   It's a blast to play!   The only downside I've felt so far - and it's not really terrible - is inventory management. There's a load of stats, and as with any RPG, we all want all the stats to be as high as possible. Well, it ain't gonna happen. There's the agonizing struggle around applying the puny number of level up points to a plethora of possibilities. And, the loot that's uncovered has a variety of statistical applications that can be distributed to... well... do I want this? Who best to give it to? Arrrrgh! I like those extra points with that, but this one has these two stats.... which one to choose? Maybe I could give it to this character... but then I lose those stats. Grrrrr! Maybe I should keep it for later on? No. Maybe I'll just sell it. No... should I wait? Maybe it'll be useful in this situation? What... ever.... should.... I... do??? **blank it*** I'll just sell it. No, I'll keep it for later. ARRRGH!!!  It's involved, at times frustrating, and can be overly time consuming. There's so many items that can enhance a variety of disparet statistics, it can be overwhelming. It's like a 20 page menu of delicious food at a great restaraunt to a starving man. I WANT IT ALL!!!  I've always been of the opinion that less is more. This game does not embrace that. There's a lot of items, that do a lot of different things, and I've probably spent more time trying to figure out who should get what, for the maximum impact, than I've spent exploring.  I'm not really unhappy about that though. For me, it's at most a minor annoyance. There is a crafting mechanism that I could take a deep dive into, which some people will do because they like exploring that type of mystery. Me? I try not to be an item hoarding ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, but ultimately I lose out on certain discoveries. But hey, it's all good y'know? I may miss out on a side quest here or there, but there's too much other content to discover so even though I've ""broken"" a few side quests so far, I've forgotten about them so I just press onward with the quests that are currently before me.  Let me put it this way: Inventory management can be tedious, but if you ""explore"" it, certain items can open additional quests. Sheesh! As if there wasn't enough to do already!  Oh, and if you put a point into Pet Pal, you can talk to the animals. Which open up probably a few dozen side quests to have fun with. I mean, why wouldn't you? There's only a hundred quests along the way, so why not open up a few dozen more??? Awww... go on! You got the time!  This game is easily worth the current price of around $40. My favorite gaming experiences have been with RPG's, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now my favorite of all time.  Well done Larian!"
Emperor Gandhi,281,137,2,May 20,Recommended,104.4,"Like my reviews? Go follow my Curator page.   As a younger gamer, I never got to experience games like Diablo 2 or Baldur's Gate in their prime, and by the time I was old enough to understand and appreciate the RPG genre, the gaming industry moved onto 3D, first/third-person RPGs like Fallout 3 and Oblivion. Eventually, CRPGs made a comeback, and I jumped onto that hype train only to be pretty disappointed. As other CRPGs haven't quite hit the spot for me, I saw this game get released on Steam and chose not to buy it because I thought I'd be underwhelmed yet again.  That was a huge mistake. While Divinity: Original Sin 2 suffers from some very serious flaws, the game's strengths are done so well that the fairly popular claim that this game is one of the ""best RPGs of all time"" is completely justified.  Graphics As was the case with the first game, the visuals are surprisingly pretty. Even though the overall tone of this game is rather dark (especially compared to D:OS 1) it still retains some of the first game's light-hearted charm and this can be reflected in the bright, cartoony visuals. The main characters are all interesting and unique visually, and the character creation system itself is incredibly deep from an appearance standpoint. Aside from some occasional frame drops, the game is pretty impressive visually.  Gameplay Divinity: Original Sin 2's biggest strength, one that makes it one of the all-time greats, is its incredible amount of player choice. This is reflected in almost every aspect of the game. The addition of physical and magic armor means that you're going to need to think a little bit more when it comes to party composition and prioritizing targets, while simply stunlocking an enemy to death isn't as effective now. On top of this, with the sheer amount of skills in the game, there are so many different ways to approach a situation. For example, you could hack away at a troll, or you could turn him into a chicken and teleport him into a pit of lava. Or, you could summon a monster (one that's just as large as that troll) on top of a fire, causing the monster to be infused with fire, and have the two duke it out with each other. The variety in skills adds so much depth to the already refined turn-based combat mechanics of the first game. While some skills and talents are better than others, the classes overall are pretty fairly balanced and offer you a lot of wiggle room to make your characters more well-rounded, and the weaker skills/talents are still playable at least. The game is also difficult, but it very rarely felt unfair. Even then, thanks to the incredible amount of choice in this game, you can easily exploit these unfair fights. Where the game falls flat gameplay-wise, however, is the final boss. Without going into spoilers, it takes the biggest strengths of this game and throws them out the window, turning into an absolute mess where you barely get to do anything. Overall though, aside from the final boss, everything in the gameplay department is perfect. The combat mechanics are deep and incredibly fun, the game overall is mostly fairly balanced, the armor system makes the game more interesting, and the sheer amount of choice makes just about anything possible. The gameplay alone makes this game worthwhile at full price, and the enhanced edition should (hopefully) make it even better.  Story Unfortunately, on the other end of the spectrum, the weakest part of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is its story. While the writing is good and the pacing starts off fairly consistent, this all goes out the window for the last third of the game. From the big climax in Act 3 and onward, the pacing goes all over the place. Act 3 as a whole is over extremely quickly, while Act 4 is drawn out some more but still fairly easy to blow through. As mentioned before, the final boss takes the biggest strengths and throws them out the window, and this includes the writing. As an example of this, one of my party members told my character that he would support me no matter what decision I made, only to get mad at me for choosing something he apparently didn't support. This happened over the span of about 30 seconds, and I'm not exaggerating that either. All of the character development of your party members is thrown aside for some reason, and it makes the finale that much more frustrating. On top of this, none of the endings are satisfying. While I understand the approach they tried to take, the drop in quality of the writing made all of them feel stupid and nullified all the progress you made in the game. However, everything else is great. Fort Joy was brilliant, and I loved watching the island slowly open up for you to explore as you escaped it. Driftwood, while definitely a lot slower paced, was filled to the brim with entertaining quests and the classic D:OS charm. Plus, the amount of player choice is also reflected here. You can talk your way out of a situation in a wide variety of different ways, and your decisions do have weight to them. Overall, while the first two acts of the game are incredible, the last two are not as great and will likely leave you disappointed.  Audio Remember how I said that almost everything in this game could be changed by the player? Well I wasn't kidding. You can choose your character's instrument, which plays during the battle (to the music) when you kill an enemy. I also personally find it pretty impressive how much of this game is voice acted. With the exception of a few conversations, almost everything has competent voice acting. Another pleasant suprise was how much I enjoyed the soundtrack. While I liked the first game's music, not much stuck out for me aside from the classic tavern music and the main menu theme. In this game, however, I found myself humming along to music like the Lady Vengeance theme and the tavern battle theme. While neither of these things are major highlights to the game, they're both done very well and do make the experience significantly more entertaining as a result.  Replayability As choice is this game's biggest strength, the replayability for D:OS 2 is very high, moreso than most other RPGs in my opinion. There's no way you can see or do everything in a single playthorugh, plus the party member quests are entertaining enough that you'll probably want to see them through for every character. Plus, with the inclusion of the excellent Game Master mode, even if you don't do multiple playthroughs of the game, you'll be spending hours on top of hours in this game. There's so many different combinations of classes and skills that experimenting is incredibly fun, and so you'll definitely have a lot of motivation to play through the game again.  Verdict To conclude, while Divinity: Original Sin 2 suffers from things like frame drops and an incredibly weak finale, the game's strengths overshadow its weaknesses so much that I still wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who might even be remotely interested. People weren't kidding, this truly is one of the best RPG games ever made, and the enhanced edition has the potential to make it the best.

It would be more appropriate to say that I've been 'content' with the games I play now and leave it at that.  Well, that is not the case with Divinity: Original Sin 2.   I'm quite envious of the fact that I was not involved with the design of this game. It has exceeded my expectations and provided me with many hours of gaming pleasure. I can only hope and pray that future sequels, please let there be more to come, are of equal or greater quality.  Thank you Larian for the many hours of gaming pleasure I have received from this game. Please keep up the good work. My sincere compliments to you and your staff."
Damashi The Kaotic,89,114,8,"June 24, 2017",Recommended,"1,284.0","Play it...just play it. This is easily one of the greatest rpgs ever made, and I would recomend it to litteraly everyone. If you like a great story, great turn based combat with an insane amount of depth, and beautiful visuals, you will fall in love with this game as much as I did.  I've played through DOS1/DOS EE around 7 times, and while the story in that game was unintresting, the gameplay alone kept me coming back. DOS2, even in its alpha state, is a vast improvement over DOS1/DOS EE in everyway.  Kill whoever you want, steal whatever isn't nailed down, Dos2 gives more freedom than any rpg to date.  *Slight Spoilers*: You can kill the gaurds on the boat, and the game has dialouge to reflect that you did. You can also kill your companions on the boat or leave them to die, and there is special dialouge for both of these actions.  Update: After having finished the full game I can safely say this is my favorite rpg of all time, period. Larian did an icredible job with this game, and its very obvious just how much love and care went into this game.  Update as of Nov 24th 2017: I've now put in over 600 hours in and I still can't stop playing it. When I'm not playing it I'm think about, and if that's not an indication of this game's quality I don't know what is. This is my game of the century, and Larian Studios has given me hope for the game industry. This is a must buy, especially if you want to give the middle finger to scummy publishers who fill their games with microtransactions, loot boxes, and other anti consumer pratices. A few bugs here and there, but nothing that truly detracts from the over all experience, and the game is patched roughly once, and Larian is one of the few publishers that I trust to fix everything (even if things that are wrong are miniscule)."

wcis,339,100,3,"November 7, 2017",Recommended,151.6,"An adventure! If I had to describe Divinity: Original Sin 2 in a word, that would be it. An adventure. Without a doubt, it‚Äôs the best modern cRPG game up to date. And as an oldschool gamer, I can understand when someone is saying that nothing can stand in one line with games like Planescape: Torment or Baldur‚Äôs Gate. Well, it couldn‚Äôt. Until now. Times changing, and so gaming industry is changing. And we have just received the best, most polished cRPG game ever made. It has to be said, even if we are sentimental.   The world of Divinity: Original Sin 2 is full of content and what‚Äôs the best, we can interact with almost everything and everyone. There are no boring NPC‚Äôs with exactly the same dialogue lines. In this game everyone is unique and has something to say. Also, we are talking here about huge cRPG game that is fully voice acted (!) and it‚Äôs not Oblivion-like voice acting with 5 actors. The main narrator, who is with us most of the time, and all the other voice actors, did an outstanding job here. Every character sounds special.  If you have played first Original Sin you know what to expect from fights. They can be approached in many different ways. Even in tough fights, one properly used scroll or skill can change everything. Of course in both ways, because we can easily lose. The fights are hard, made to think in strategic ways and what‚Äôs the most important, they are very satisfying. Comparing to other cRPG games it‚Äôs one of the best parts of Divinity.  It took me roughly 105 hours to finish the game once, so it can be said that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the biggest cRPG games. What‚Äôs more, this game has high replayability value. Every character has its own personality and its own origin story. By playing with different characters we have new quests and we can approach many situations in totally different way ‚Äì origin characters have their own interactions across whole game. The main story is interesting and I have never lost my interest. I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything, but it‚Äôs just really good piece of writing. Side quests are keeping high level as well. Same as in first Original Sin, we also receive minimal amount of help in all the quests. We have to think, search and read. Just like in real cRPG game.  I have completed this game few days ago and to be honest, I can‚Äôt wait to play it again. I am thinking about new characters and about making different decisions in several points of the game. It‚Äôs something amazing. There are many huge games, like The Witcher 3 or Fallout 4 that can give you +/- 100 hours of actual playtime, but those are mostly single experience games. You are not playing them again. There is something different in Divinity that make you want to play it again. More and more! In Civilization series we are saying about ‚Äúone more turn‚Äù syndrome. Here we have ‚Äúone more hour‚Äù, ‚Äúone more evening‚Äù and ‚Äúone more day syndrome‚Äù!  There are no perfect, 10/10 games, and there is no difference here. The game is quite fresh, so there are still bugs. I haven‚Äôt experienced any gamebreaking bug though, but there are many small things that for sure will be fixed in the future. What‚Äôs more, the final act and final battle are both the weakest parts of the game. You can feel that devs were in hurry here, but on the other side, whole game is so good, that this ‚Äúrushed‚Äù ending won‚Äôt outshine beautiful, interesting and so carefully designed game. It simply can‚Äôt.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is, in my humble opinion, the best game of year 2017. Let‚Äôs just hope we will see more cRPG‚Äôs like this in the future (Obsidian, we are looking at you). Do yourself a favour and buy this game. It will be the best +/- 100 hours you can have as a gamer. And for this price, that is not even close to the other ""AAA"" titles with unhealthy DLC policy, it's a steal.   Whoop. We've got quite a long review here! Enjoy the game! :)  9+/10  EDIT: Found typo."
Metsakurat,"1,205",47,0,October 17,Recommended,120.7,"A masterpiece It took me around 100 hours to finish the game. The world of Rivellon is both big and alluring. It was a joy to explore every single corner of it. Each battle was challenging, fun, made me use different tactics and I never got tired of fighting. The game balances roleplaying and combat perfectly. In some RPGs the combat is fine but the story and characters are what keep you playing. However in Original Sin 1 I didn't really care for the story while Original Sin 2 kept me interested at all times. It really improves on the lore, roleplaying and combat. It's definitely a good sequel and one of the best games of 2017.  I only have two complaints: Romance had no effect on the ending and the amount of puzzles in the game. It would have taken me A LOT more than 100 hours to finish the game because of the puzzles.  Now don't get me wrong. The puzzles are all interesting and well executed. There are some simple puzzles, moderate and very hard ones. I just don't have too much time to play video games and since there are so many puzzles in the game I had to resort to using Google way more than I'd like to admit. Now the romance and with it some minor spoilers ahead. I decided to romance Lohse. At the end of the game she asked me if I would like to travel the world with her and I can't answer her. All I can do is end the conversation and in the final cutscene the narrator tells me that she spent the rest of her life traveling Rivellon alone.  Just dissapointing.  But what is the game about? What's the story like? You have the ability to use Source - A powerful and outlawed magic. Magic used by the gods themselves. It's what gives them power. The game starts with you being captured by Magisters who hunt and imprison everyone who can use Source. They take you to an isolated prison island. While there you make new friends, discover an unbelievable truth about yourself and make interesting alliances while trying to escape the island. You will meet dragons, witches, paladins, underground fighting arenas, demons, trolls, ghosts and much, much more. You will also uncover conspiracies and astonishing secrets. Will you be the new Divine?  The game itself plays alot like the recent XCOM games. It's basically a turn-based roleplaying game. Not to worry tho. You can still create a custom character and choose their stats, race, gender, and origin story or you can simply choose one of the pre-made characters. There's a wide variety of classes to choose from as well. All your favourate melee, ranged and magic classes are there. It also has Steam Workshop and modders have made some really interesting class mods that are worth checking out. However, if you enable mods you are not able to earn achivements. This, in my humble opinion, is a bit foolish. It's a singleplayer game and I should be allowed to have my fun however I want. The trainers still work and it has no leaderboards in it so I don't really support disabling achivements for mod users. It's a minor complaint but a complaint nonetheless.  The game is well optimised and ran at a solid 60 frames per second at all times. I did experience two crashes during my playthrough but other than that I really didn't notice any other bugs or issues. Visually the game is lovely to look at and the soundtrack is marvelous. Don't go into it expecting remarkable next gen graphics though.  It's a game I most definitely won't forget any time soon. I want a sequel and I want it now! A must play for every roleplaying fan and fans of the turn-based genre should give it a go as well. Well done, Larian Studios, well done. "

Shard of Manus,41,75,1,March 13,Recommended,177.4,"Divinity Original Sin 2 - Larian's second foray into the grand re-imagining of the Divinity universe, and one can only say... they really outdid themselves this time.   Larian Studios takes a bold step into the old RPG style that players were so enamoured by with the original Divine Divinity, only with all the polish of modern capabilities, and the extremely successful and informative release of Divinity Original Sin (and its Enhanced Edition) granting them insight into the necessary improvements that make DOS2 the absolute masterpiece that it is.   Players can be sure to find themselves trapped within this game for such lengths of time that the outside world shall begin to pass by unnoticed, as one becomes so transfixed with the beauty of Larian's latest release. Divinity Original Sin 2 is perhaps the most engaging, exciting, satisfying and well-designed Adventure RPG of the decade... and that is quite the title to fight for.   -----------------   The world of DOS2 is massive. Hours upon hours upon hours of dense, creative and unique content stacked together in this vibrant and stunning game world. Every location itself is chock full of fantastic characters, all fully voiced with quality acting, and each with a rich and realistic personality and story that drive the player's desire to uncover every ounce of their story and build upon the deep lore and sprawling history of the world of Divinity.   The main campaign spans four Acts, each filled to the brim with hours of non-linear content including side quests, treasure hunts, battles, secrets to be uncovered and more all with multiples ways to be completed and numerous outcomes - and with such immense amounts of freedom and player choice, the likes of which almost no modern game can compete with, there really is no dull moment in Divinity, and this game is a shining example of the effort and dedication Larian puts into their work.   -----------------   The combat of DOS2 has been revamped since the previous release, though maintaining much of what it once was. Divinity Original Sin 2, like its predecessor, adopts turn-based combat, and turns it into one of the most finely crafted and perfect editions of this style of combat to date. Every moment of battle is exciting and even for one such as I, whom rarely plays turn-based games, the combat was astoundingly well designed and thoroughly enjoyable.   Players command all manner of skills thanks to the diverse customisation options available and freedom of choice, with crafting bombs, traps, potions, poisons, arrows and much, much more, players will always find themselves with an array of tools with which to combat the enemy. No class is tied to any particular tree of skills, and one can mix and match as they see fit... provided they learn how to best use such abilities.   DOS2 encourages interactivity with the environment, and players have much freedom to use objects, terrain and combinations of attacks for devastating effects. If there is oil, set it ablaze. If there is water, freeze it so that your enemies slip. The combinations are many, and are far deeper and complex than just those above. This game holds some of the most complex and intriguing combat systems I know.   Combat is by no means forgiving, and the game boasts a variety of difficulty options that make enemies easier, or expand their skills sets and AI intelligence such as that they pose worthy adversaries to even well skilled players.   -----------------   Something brought to players for the first time in Divinity Original Sin makes its triumphant return in DOS2, and that is the wonderfully designed multiplayer aspect. Drop-in / drop-out co-op allows players to seamlessly enter the world of another player and join them on their journey... be they ally or foe.   The multiplayer system is beyond extensive, and to the delight of some players, and the woe of others, players can act as friend or foe on their journey - and betrayal is a sweet thing.   The absolute freedom of the multiplayer system does have its faults however, as playing with strangers can sometimes lead to them rushing through things, progressing without you or making choices that you didn't want to make. It is highly recommended that players save co-op until after their first playthrough, or only play with friends that one can communicate with easily and rely on. DOS2s world is too big and too grand to risk someone spoiling it for you.   However, in my experience, playing DOS2 with a friend or two (or 3) is an inimitable experience that all should try. Working together or against one another towards the finale of this game is thrilling beyond imagination.   -----------------   So, alongside the beautifully crafted world, intricate characters, massive freedom of choice, expansive customisation and awesome combat, Divinity Original Sin 2, much like other installments in the series, boasts an amazing soundtrack.   Composed by Borislav Slavov, DOS2s soundtrack combines epic scores, emotional pieces and the jovial warmth of tavern music in one of the best compositions of the year and even beyond, rivalling that of Hollow Knight, NieR: Automata and potentially even the Witcher 3.   With traditional styles of RPG music reminiscent of golden oldies, each with its own unique flair and spark, and returning tracks from other Divinity titles, the music of Larian's latest game is something no-one will not enjoy. Hours of beautiful tracks, some of which are placed so heart-wrenchingly well within the game world that you will no doubt be straight onto YouTube and listening to the whole lot for hours.   With everything else DOS2 has to offer, the Soundtrack really is the cherry on top, and it is something to behold.   -----------------   To summarise Divinity Original Sin 2 into one word, it would have to be... brave. Larian Studios started the development of this game precariously, via Kickstarter backing; and after the amazing success of Divinity Original Sin, they had certainly garnered enough interest to support their new installment. Their return to old school RPG styles was a risk that paid off... not because the style is popular, but because Larian took something good, and turned it into something beyond great.   DOS2 is, and will no doubt remain for some time, among my favourite games of all time. I have sunk so many hours into this game, through several playthroughs and still each new one is unique and engaging. Here is a timeless game. Play it, with all my heart, I tell you to play it."
Squeaks,60,64,5,February 19,Recommended,77.4,"I am a very casual gamer. I played WoW many years ago obsessively, and since then have really only gotten into a couple of flings with games. As someone who works full time, I don't have the time (or, honestly, the interest) in playing a game that requires me to play ALL THE TIME to keep up with everyone else. Adversely, I'm usually pretty bored with single player games.  I also hate turn-based games.  Despite that, I was browsing the most-purchased in the Steam store and decided on buying this game after reading the reviews.   This game took me about a month to complete, and I clocked in 75 hours. I can't even remember the last time a campaign took me more than 8 hours.... I actually was interested in what NPC's had to say, talked to everyone, opened every chest, etc. Not because I felt I had to, but because I really loved the game that much. Also, if I had played this game without looking up most of the quests online, it would've taken me at least double that time.  The combat was super fun, even though it was turn based. I was constantly looking for new spellbooks, planning out my rotations, etc.  It was also challenging - I really had to make sure my party was well-equipped and balanced in their abilities.  There were some fights I had to retry a few times, and it felt like more of a fun challenge than a tedious part of the gameplay.    After finishing the game, I'm going to go back and replay it a second time with a different strategy and a slightly higher difficulty.

Just take some time off work and play this game... trust me.  The only danger here is that after I finished the game, I kinda feel like I'm done with gaming. I feel... complete, like every game I ever played was building up to this and nothing could ever be better than Divinity 2 (particularly Lohse's story arc). So, keep that in mind. You might be spoiled after playing."
iingaate,72,223,3,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,143.3,"First time reviewing a game, but felt I should on this one. I never did play the first game though heard good things about it, so figured give the second a run. So far...even in early access I can't say I was disappointed. The game it's self reminds me of classic computer RPGs and pen 'n paper RPGs I played when I was much younger just a bit more fair and easier to understand yet still maintaining a lot of what made them challenging. Character customization starts a bit limited but as you get higher in levels its more about what you want to play and what your party members be. You are not locked into your starting class at all and I love that, hoping they have a lot more choices in the full release.   Gameplay wise is point and click, though I found there is a lot to interact with in the world in different ways, one of the more different ways I found was that playing an Elf or having an Elf in your group, the elf can eat a corpse and gain the memories of that person, and it actually does play a part in the game. Combat is much of the same, point and click with a lot of tactical choices to make, the enemy AI is well refined and act in actually very smart ways even on the easier difficulties. I also found it pretty neat how your spells, items and attacks can change the battle ground and make hazards for yourself and your enemies, with the enemies able to do the same. Such as freezing a wet spot on the ground to give a chance of someone slipping on the spot or shocking the water with lighting to stun everyone standing in the wet spot. Though at times at least for me I found it hard to move to avoide these hazards at times like the area they were affecting were slightly larger than they really were.  I even tried a bit of co-op with friends and a bit hidden in a sense once we figured it out, connecting with one another was clean and easy to do.   Storywise I found interesting enough, a dark world with many dark themes with demons, torture and corruption. The premade characters have backgrounds and behave well according to their backgrounds. Another different system in this game is the tag system. Basicly pick tags for your character and you will have in game choices that you can make based just on those tags you pick. The pre mades having different choices as well they can make based on their stand alone backgrounds. Though it does feel you can get same results no matter your background still, it does help with immersion and at in making your created character feel seprate from the rest.   Graphics, are not that important to me, but they are decent enough in this game. Though playing completely zoomed out (pretty much the only way to play an RPG like this) I found it a bit difficult to notice things I could pick up or interact with since they are so small. A few rare times I misclicked on something because of how small it is. I have an older system, so I wasn't able to play on the highest settings, I was able to however able to play on high even though the game suggested I play on low. So I can see pretty much everyone able to play this game with no issues. Even when I tried the highest settings I just had a slight drop in Frame rate.  Overall Divinity 2 I recommend highly, especially if you are a fan of old school RPGs and Pen 'n Paper RPGs, you will feel right at home playing this with a high level of immersion and ability to costumize your character however you desire. Story had been done before but it's presented well in the world, and should be interesting enough to keep you playing. Combat is deep, and will challenge the thinking sides of your brain to approach each encounter in most effective way possible, plus have you thinking best way to build your characters to deal with threats in your prefered way. You might find a little frustration in interacting with the world due to how small things are and will even miss a few things if you aren't careful, but it shouldn't be a big enough issue to remove any enjoyment in the game.   Hope you found this helpful if you took the time to read it."
Athravan,"1,782",80,4,January 8,Recommended,99.9,"Now that 2017 is but a memory I can say with confidence that Divinity: Original Sin 2 was my Game of the Year. Although I backed the game on Kickstarter (just like the first) and had an Early Access copy, I didn‚Äôt play it until full launch so that I could fully immerse myself. And immerse myself I did into this high-fantasy adventure that manages to make the magical and fantastical feel realistic and gritty. It has taken everything that was good about Divinity: Original Sin and improved upon it, whilst also making it so you don‚Äôt need to have played the first in any way as it takes place a thousand years before.  Whether I‚Äôm following a quest that portrays me as the savior of the universe (hero complex much?) or trying to solve the angst of a tiny rat I really believe in my characters and their responses. There is a balance between the epic and the banal, the frivolous and the fateful that creates a woven world that is wonderful to experience.  In my first playthrough, co-op with a friend, I‚Äôm a summoner, focusing on gathering my minions. I‚Äôm a bit heavy handed though, I‚Äôll send my minions into battle at a moments notice from afar, but stand aside, watching the ebb and flow, supporting and commanding the field. I speak harsh truths and it frequently gets me into trouble even though I feel righteous. In my solo playthrough, I‚Äôm a morally ambiguous pickpocketing hitman with a deep, dark past that I‚Äôve blocked from memory. I fight with my words, and flirt with absolutely everyone, often getting what I desire in alternative ways. Even though the majority of the quests are the same on multiple playthroughs (bar the character story quests which too, are dark and deep), it feels different. Different dialogue and varying methods result in genuinely diverse results and that‚Äôs testament to the freedom, flexibility and depth of the game.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 rewards exploration and creativity as many side quests can only be discovered or completed by turning over every rock, talking to every NPC or trying things that are a little out of the box. This may frustrate some but delighted me at every stage. There are no glowing quest signs and immersion breaking yellow exclamation marks here. If you don‚Äôt like reading, that‚Äôs fine ‚Äì as everything is beautifully and uniquely voiceovered. But if you don‚Äôt like paying attention to detail, you‚Äôre going to miss out on a lot of the fun. This game is for people who like to genuinely invest their time and attention into the world they‚Äôre playing and the characters in it. Perhaps that, above all else is what reminds me of the D&D campaigns from my youth that I sorely miss.  Tactically the combat is as complicated as you make it, with different difficulty settings that cater to your preference for challenge. You can brute force things if you‚Äôre so inclined, but you‚Äôre rewarded for playing smart at any level and the game gives you the tools to feel like a tactical genius, with a deep satisfaction when you pull off a clever combo.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 has the old school charm of Baldur‚Äôs Gate and Planescape Torment but with modern mechanics and beautiful aesthetics, I finally feel like an RPG has surpassed them. It only took a few decades for us to get here. I wonder if this is the pinnacle of the genre and how long it‚Äôll be before I can say that about a game again.   ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• If you find the reviews of an old Welsh lady interesting, please follow  My Curator Page.

I don't like tedious quests, I dont like common NPC stereotypes, I hate lousy combat mechanics and poor strategy, and above all else I hate it when a game plays like it literally cant spell ""scenario"".  But raising a baby demon chicken to conquer the world and tele-rob ignorant merchants? Igniting grenades in people's pockets and befriend a cat for no effing reason ? Just cause you know, he's like mysterious and all? And he's a really good looking cat, all the while being lectured by a crab? Oh, and trying to become a demigod and save the world, apparently  insane pathing possibilities (OH DEAR TP) Well rounded scenario, emo NPCs that drink blood or are possessed by demons like it's totally fine, and GOD the landscapes!!! I did spend a whole 10 minutes exploring a map and praising its beauty before remembering I had entered a fight. Hell, I just like clicking a spell and not actually launching it cause the casting animation is then suspended and they're F***ING MAGNIFICENT (not as much as my cat, tho. He's a nice cat.)  So yeah, Maybe it's a bit too much, maybe it's been written a hundred times but playing this in coop mode was (one of?) the best gaming experience in my entire life. Entertaining, challenging, captivating, and of course it makes no sense sometimes cause you keep doing awesome tricks with your cat to try F**KING with the scenario. But you know what? It adapts to all the sh*t you do. It gets your sh*t together. It gets it all together, puts it in a backpack, all your sh*t, so it's all together. And then it makes wonders from out of nowhere and you're like ""but I was trying to act crazy! And I did! And still, cool sh*t keeps happening! It's a F***ING transsh*itation!!! Like alchemy or something!""  It's beautiful, smart sometimes even touching, funny as hell, and you know the best part? It has a cool cat. And it's nice.  And hidden quests, and insane replayability, and nutsy combos, and a perfect leveling/reroll system, and Malady is kinda sexy but like, not entirely but that's okay. And talking boat, and a condor, a phoenix omelett and A CAT. AND GODS AND ALL BUT A CAT MOSTLY. And you know what? THE CAT REALLY IS IMPORTANT!!!! I mean even a common (though really nice) cat DOES HAVE its own scenario and voice acting!! Cause every EFFING DIALOG has voice acting!!! like hours of it!  This is your best investment this year and if you have a friend that you like and he likes good ol RPGs like you (Baldur's gate, Neverwinter Night, Icewind Dale's fans, I'm looking right at yo, dawgs), buy it and offer it like my friend offered it to me.

Kodijack!,"2,014",203,10,"October 2, 2017",Recommended,156.2,"(Remark 1: I never tried the game in EA. I knew it was wiser to wait for full release. So everything here bases on the final thing  Remark 2: I don't give a damn about hype or hate. I usually don't read a single word about a game prior to purchase and decide to purchase based on experience and judgement of the presentation. And due to high age and experience I usually don't fail there hehe) )  Woah! What a masterpiece RPG. I really already liked the first DOS (and its predecessors, although completly different, too). And I'm not much into turn-based top-down (more or less, I know it's 3D) RPGs at all. And this time they really managed to drag you into their world. Many races, interesting locations, tons of secrets, tons of sidequests, billions of lines of conversations... It's not a perfect game, and surely has some tiny flaws, but the overall experience damn rocks. That love for all those details. Like at some point there is a Pianist-ghost (which you don't see usually without a skill) and beside her is a book of Kirill's (*sigh*) best songs. And you can ask her to play those. And she does. Spent like 15 minutes in that mansion just standing there and listen to Kirill's songs. That ""pet-pal""-Talent alone is worth a thumbs-up. It's so enjoyable talking to ""critters"" on a map. Getting hints, secrets or even quests. Or just ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t nonsense :)   Pro-Hint (super tiny spoiler): Try to keep that cat alive at all costs you'll met very soon into the game ,-)  If you love RPG, like or can endure turn-based, there's no way around this one. GET IT. If you dislike RPG or turn-based: stay the heck away. This is not the droid you're looking for.   The good (what to love):  Play as one of the ""origin""-characters. With their own complete backstory. Which is highly recommended for your first playthrough. But you can still customize your character completly.  Graphics are really neat  SFX/Music is really great. Sadly no more new (obviously) tracks from Kirill. RIP man!  You can talk with animals. One of the coolest features ever in an RPG. Meet snobby cats, cynical crabs, hopelessly positive dogs, etc. Not only for fun, but also for quests, hints, secrets or for pure distracting amusement...Awesome feature!  MODS! The best thing a game could have. You don't like a particular feature? Get a mod. There is none? Make one. Every game should have that. PERIOD. This is and often was the distinct feature that seperated pretty good from AWESOME and long-lasting games.  Completely voiced, not one sentence is not spoken. I know, many people don't care, but it doesn't hurt either, does it? I personally like it for added immersion.  No bugs/crashed so far. After two complete playthroughs at the moment of this review. Not even a misaligned texture.  Often many ways to solve a problem. For example getting of the first island there are around 11 (right?) different ways to do that. Sure, most are pretty similar and end in more or less the same result, but as I often say: it's a game and not reality. Impossible to give you REAL freedom. It still feels like YOU chose the results.   Many actions DO have consequences. Some minor, some major.   Well done turn-based. From my noobish-PoV though. Fights are fun and can range from relaxing to OMFG-WHAT-HAVE-I-DONE.  Comparatively short loading-times. Once a map loaded, you instantly(!) switch areas (like to a cave or whatever else transition). VERY MUCH appreciated. Nothing kills immersion more than stupid 1-minute ""LOADING...""-screen. In and out of a cave in not a second. Yeah, great, thanks!  Tiny details like being able to make notes on the map. VERY helpful if you discover something that you MIGHT be able to solve/do/pickup/catch later.  You can specialize all of your companions upon you first meet them. Great detail! Like one of the characters but don't need their supposed role? Fine, change it. No problem.  End of Act 1, when you finally got a grip of things and how this crap works, you will get your option to RESPEC every character completely (including apprerance). YES! I love that. Some of us gamers don't want to put hundreds of hours into ONE game and multiple walkthroughs and be more efficient in JUST ONE walkthrough. Thanks for that. If you hate a feature like that, you don't HAVE to use it. The mediocre (not good, not bad, but no show-stopper either):  Some schools/talents/skills are somehow pointless and you will never use them. Good idea, bad execution  Some ambient chatter become VERY annoying VERY quickly when you're e.g. shopping near and micro-managing equipment. Damn stupid NPCs :-)  From time to time it doesn't really seem to matter much how you're playing (be the nice guy or the sociopathic arsewipe). Some or most encounters are bound to happen anyway either way. But well this is a game and not the real world, it's impossible to be prepared for everything :)  VERY high replayability (not a PRO for people with not much sparetime for gaming). Many ways to complete quests, enough people to form a party and hence change the quests/suprises/sidequests. This might be a big plus if you have much time at your hands.  If you hate micromanagement you might even be a lil frustrated at the lowest difficulty. You will have to manage gear, skills, talents and spells for four characters nearly every 5 meters when you've found a new thing. Lower difficulties are very forgiving though. But can still challenge you if you have zero idea of what's going on. But if everything's too much for you there are still MODS or even cheats.   No real Set-items. Well on the first Island there is a set. But not wearing the complete set curses you and by the time you'll have it complete it's of no use at all. And there isn't even a set-bonus. Reducing this to a boring errand for the completionist. The ugly (what to hate, may kill the fun):  Items rarely really feel unique or great. Found a ""legendary""? Yeah well, walk 10meters and you'll find the next better one. Plus most non-""unique""-items are random which often results in horribly sucky items. Intelligence-requireing pants with +X strength. Strength-requirement-ring with +X Intelligence and some mage-stats. Yeah great. For selling. Boring. For example the first SET: Great to aquire. Requires lot of work/details. But you'll end up selling that stuff for some coins before even completing it to WEAR it. Meh, VERY unsatisfying.   SOMETIMES it can be hard to even spot your enemies in between turns due to all those status-effects on the screen. Could be worse, but could definately be better.  If you play on higher difficulties you might find some schools/classes/character-combinations pretty useless/unfair. That MIGHT kill it for you. But balancing a complex RPG like this perfectly is pretty much impossible to admit. No excuse? You're to judge...  Crafting sucks. No filtering, no sorting and you learn new recipes every few meters. But I failed to find the need to craft anything besides runes anyway. Recommended?  If you can wrap your head around turn-based and like RPGs? YESYESYESYESYES! Don't hesitate. Even if you don't much like top-down games. You'll quickly forget that (I usually prefer 1st-Person). This is one beautifully crafted gem, with love for details. I'd name it the Witcher-Series of turn-based-isometric-RPGs. And I'm a Witcher-Lover."

Johnny_Devo,150,86,4,"January 1, 2017",Recommended,236.1,"When I first got this game, I was immediately assaulted by an array of limiting areas, tough enemies, and hard fights, to the point where it felt like I wasn't allowed to do anything except a very strict railroad of easier enemies in order to progress. It made me start to lose faith in the game, because it seemed like there was only an illusion of freedom.  But then I got good. After floundering around in my first save file for a good few hours, I sat down and made a new character, applying everything I had learned. I made a focused character. I scrounged for every piece of armor, clawed at every possible avenue and advantage, and I applied the very tactics that destroyed me in the first playthough. It didn't take long to learn that if done right, the game is just as impossible for your enemies as it could be for you.  What I was rewarded with was knowing that there are, for example, several different ways to complete the first area. It's not a railroad; I just, to put it blunt, sucked. In fact, after discovering my first way though that beginning area... I went back in, and starting clearing out enemies, starting in order from most managable. It became an arms race of beating the lowest enemies I could find, surviving the encounter, and assimilating any loot I could find, up to and including the paintings on the walls.  Then, I come up to what I'll call ""midway"" through the first act. Suddenly things are falling into place with the plot, and I'm gaining hints of what appears to be a really neat story in the making. The varied things you can encounter kept my interest once I had the skill to progress, managing gear was interesting due to the magic armor and physical armor differences, and limited resources forced me to make interesting decisions every time I came across a nice piece of gear in a shop.  I began to learn of the various advantages and disadvantages inherent to different styles. Spreading your points can mean you have access to a ton of powerful toolbox abilities, but don't deal much damage. You can focus all your points into one aspect, and that character will be a high damage monster, but will lack in utility in comparison. Pair two such characters together, and your high damage will punch through the defenses of your victim, then the utility monster will knock them down for a turn, only to be put in the ground for good by your high damage character's second round.  Essentially, what I'm saying is if you find yourself overwhelmed by this game like I was at first, I suggest you attempt to absorb what the game is beating into you, then try to use that to beat it back into the game. If you can manage that, the varied builds and playstyles as well as the interactive battle system may just capture your attention.  Overall, this game is already something that I would consider great, and they're only in early access. They're still working on the game and the story, accepting feedback from the forums, and they're doing it well. Worth the full price now, can only get better from here. Would recommend."

DO NOT GET ME WRONG, the fights can be really, really unforgiving(ofc i play in classic), but rewarding as well.  10/10 i'd murder that child again."
jeep,161,48,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,75.4,"I am incredibly excited to say that this game is all that I could have asked of Larian Studios. As someone who loves Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, etc, Divinity: Original Sin 2 simply blows my mind. The dialogue can be witty, comedic, even tongue-in-cheek, but at times it is also grim, dark, and serious. Each character has their own way of coping with situations, and you as the player must work to keep the group together. You can choose the class of all of your adventurers, and tweak your main character at the start screen - in effect, you can multiclass from the get-go. Abilities synergize and can create opportunities that can be exploited by other party members - or, if you're not careful, by the enemy!   In terms of customization, the game is lovely. In summation, you can advance your character in a non-linear fashion if you so choose, but you might find it easier to create classes that are symbiotes (they benefit from each other's abilities).  In terms of audio, the game is FANTASTIC. The voice acting is wonderfully immersive, and the sound effects are well-timed and well-orchestrated. Speaking of orchestas, the soundtrack is incredible. If you don't believe me, give it a listen on YouTube. The ability to choose which instrument will play at turning points of the campaign really gives you that feeling of audio customization, and lets you feel like you are in control of every aspect of the game.  In short, I may sound like a ""yes-man"" when I wholeheartedly recommend this game. I may sound like there's nothing wrong with the game, but there are several bugs which are still unfixed and exploits that can be exposed to the savvy gamer. But, if you are like me, and you simply enjoy a game for what it has to offer (a complex storyline, diverse characters, entertaining combat, excellent audio, above-average graphics), then this game is for you!"

Yemeth,413,81,0,"December 15, 2017",Recommended,197.3,"You know those games that are just a few tweaks away of greatness? The original Original Sin was that kind of game.It had modernised CRPG mechanics,great combat,lots of choices on how to get on with the world,wonderful crafting yet cumbersome UI and a muddled story (even with the Enhancements later released)  Original Sin 2 tries to rectify all those mistakes. For my detailed review check this out:  http://indiannoob.in/divinity-original-sin-2-review-pc-noobreview-dungeons-dragons-and-mashed-potatoes/  +For starters, it has a more straightforward and darker storyline and writing. +The UI has been refined and is a lot more accessible +Character creation, customistaion, companions are all great. +General gameplay is still solid packing deep environmental interaction(in&out combat),fun crafting and exciting turn-based combat with good animations. +Classes are varied and many and balanced very well +Pretty much all lines are voice acted and they do a decent job.Same with the soundtrack +Challenging Tactician difficulty in which the game should be played (Normal being too easy) +Game Master mode for PnP RPG simulation and co-op is fun as always +Game looks great with a more grounded art style this time around +Mod Support   -I felt the streamlining of RPG attributes and skills from the first game is a bit of a let down (Although they allow less trial & error playthroughs) -The crafting seems to have been downplayed this time around.They have taken out the skills related to crafting and some fun recipes -Normal difficulty is way too easy,at least in the first chapter.  -Tactician mode felt cheap in some aspect like when it gives enemy ridiculous amount of physical and magical armor.In the first game,higher diffiiculty meant more enemies and smarter A.I.  TL:DR Orignal Sin 2 easily takes it's place as one of the greatest CRPGs ever along with Baldur's  Gate,Fallout,Wasteland,Planescape:Torment etc and at the same time possess mastery over it's technical aspects something the afforementioned games never did possess."
KRAUSER-SAMA,615,123,5,September 28,Recommended,74.7," The Short of it  Please note that everything that I write is based on my experiences with the Definitive Edition, and will also be looked at as standalone rather than compared to its predecessor.   Pros: +The world of Divinity OS 2 is vast and deep +The characters are fantastic, applies to NPCs but especially the Origin characters +An easy enough to understand combat system that possesses a great amount of depth +Absolutely stunning graphics +From the sound design to the soundtrack and especially the voice acting, it‚Äôs superb +The modding community is impressive to say the least with tons of ways to augment your experience  Cons: -...   More In-depth (Spoiler-Free)   +Story: Let‚Äôs start this off with one of DOS2‚Äôs greatest points, the story and world. While of course staying as spoiler free as possible, the game comes with an incredibly vast world for you to explore and venture through as you work towards your ultimate objective (which I‚Äôll be withholding for any prospective players interested in the game). From the main quest to the side quests, from your perspective as the protagonist to the NPCs in the game‚Äôs world, Larian has truly given thought to how they‚Äôd flesh out every area in terms of it‚Äôs lore. The greatest part of all of this is that, despite being a sequel, there's no disconnect for the player even if you having played the first. While I recommend playing both, I can assure any of you who were hesitant about diving straight into the second, it's completely alright to do so. This point on just how deep the world of DOS2 goes becomes apparent the moment you attempt to create a character and are revealed the Origin characters which I will be focusing on next.   +Origin: What is an origin character? Origin characters are a set of 6 very unique characters that already have their backgrounds integrated into the very core of the game. You can think of them as the closest thing to a preset character when thinking in terms of RPGs, but you needn‚Äôt fret, they are completely customizable on their stat spread and what class you wish to play as. I especially love these origin characters because they add an entirely new layer to what‚Äôs going on, you‚Äôre not only worrying about the current state of the world as the story tells it, but also your own circumstances. For example (very minor spoiler ahead), one of the origin characters is a red lizard with the title of ‚ÄúThe Red Prince‚Äù, born for glory yet fell from grace for ‚Äúcavorting with demons‚Äù, and on his own quest to reclaim his rightful throne. Given his position in the overall world of the game, he‚Äôs an important figure to say the least, as a result very early on in the game an assassin will make an attempt on your life. That is just a very small insight as to what DOS2 has to offer. These origin characters could each have their own stories told separately, but no, they intertwine into a much bigger tale. The amount of content you get from the narrative of this game alone is astonishing, and for that Larian Studios deserves a round of applause.  +Gameplay: Now, let‚Äôs get to the real meat of the game, shall we? How does the game play? In a word, spectacular. The game, as a CRPG, gets the job down without many issues. From traversing the various lands to engaging in combat, the game both looks and feels great. As a keyboard and mouse user at the very least I found the controls to be quite intuitive. Combat is fairly simple, you learn skills and associate those skills to your hotkey of preference, activating said skill will either require that you choose a target or a specified location (Area of Effect) which will be controlled by your mouse. Pretty simple, right? However, the battlefield is ever changing and the higher the difficulty, the more considerate you need to be of what exactly is happening and how you should react accordingly. There are many factors that can go into a fight than just slinging spells into the face of your enemy, environmentals and utility based effects can be the key to turning the tide in a battle. This may sound like rather obvious advice, but I can‚Äôt think of a CRPG that‚Äôs done it better than how Larian Studios has.  Like in D&D (where you will often hear the comparison made), the game really starts from the beginning of the game, the character creation (yeah, we‚Äôre back to good ol‚Äô character making) the distribution of your points from the beginning and how you proceed from thereafter is crucial, especially if you‚Äôre a player that wishes to challenge themselves with the highest difficulty. One particular stat in the game that I‚Äôd like to bring up in reference to this point is the ‚Äúmemory‚Äù stat. Memory is a stat that you upgrade when you wish to assign more skills to your hotbar. Learning the spell is one thing, but you can‚Äôt cast that which you haven‚Äôt ‚Äúmemorized‚Äù. As a summoner/caster hybrid of sorts I cannot tell you how much memory played a factor in how I progressed because there is such a wide variety of builds I wish to try. You can of course find a few mods to make this easier, but that‚Äôs completely player preference, I personally like the restriction otherwise I‚Äôd be a walking arsenal (which is fun in it‚Äôs own right hehe). The game is easy enough to understand but there are a number of factors that will make or break you in this game if you aren‚Äôt careful, be it in combat or otherwise.  +Graphics: Typically, a CRPG‚Äôs main concern isn‚Äôt how it looks, but DOS2 has been crafted with very special care in this regard. The environments are beautiful (in more than one sense depending on where you‚Äôre looking), the character models are fair and above all else magic possesses a special sort of impact I don‚Äôt see in other games of its genre. I‚Äôm particularly infatuated with the animations and poses performed when casting spells, the details on these animations alone are something to be in awe of.  +Sound: I must say, the sound design in this game is great given the variety of different types of skills there are to learn. In respect to the background music, in character creation, you can actually select an instrument of choice to play the soundtrack. This I found to be a very nice touch, as someone who likes his music. However, the aspect I‚Äôm truly stunned by is the voice acting. Just pure, high quality voice acting planted throughout the game for every NPC (including animals!). This is a standard I wish more games had already adopted, but we live in a world where many AAA titles still cheap out on giving certain lines any audible lines.  +Mods: The game provides a plethora of content on its own, but that‚Äôs not all the fun that‚Äôs to be had. Say hello to the world of mods if you‚Äôre playing DOS2. THe modding community for this game is incredible, there are many quality of life mods, class overhauls, or completely new classes altogether with specially made animations just for that class! Of course, that isn‚Äôt all there is to modding in this game, but I feel that those are the major ones to point out. Modding can truly enhance your experience, or extend the lifetime of this already eternal game by an unfathomable amount. If you feel bored playing a game once, even in a game with as much diversity as this, well mods will change that.    Conclusion  I could nag about the infinitesimally issues that rarely popped up here and there (like the particular position of the camera interfering with a particular action), but there‚Äôs just too much good content to talk about to even try. No matter what angle you try to look at this game from, it easily stands out from the rest and establishes itself at the top of its kind. A truly ‚Äúdivine‚Äù game.

Tuco,750,80,7,"November 25, 2017",Recommended,336.6,"Divinity: original Sin 2 is a strong contender to ""Game of the Year""  and with few meaningful tweaks it could easily compete to rank among the best RPGs of all time.  Like for its predecessor, its strong points are the massive amount of player agency permitted, one of the best turn-based combat systems in the business, a great degree of environmental interaction and very solid encounter design.  Disappointingly enough, this sequel fails mostly in the same area that hindered its predecessor: itemization and stat bloat. Larian's stubbornness with randomized loot over unique and hand-placed items means you'll never get rewards that are meaningful, just generic items that can drop anywhere or pop in any merchant's inventory at any given time. That kills a lot of incentives to bring down strong enemies, solve quests and explore for hidden treasures: when every action can potentially get the same outcome, it doesn't really feel like accomplishments matter that much.  On top of that, the problem with stat bloat emerges few hours into the game. While the problem presents itself from the beginning (by the time you'll get all the pieces of the first armor set in the starting area they'll be completely obsolete), it becomes genuinely grating past level 14-15, as you'll quickly get to the point where the jump in values at each level will be so ridiculous you'll literally double your HP/damage/armor values, etc. This essentially forces (well, strongly encourages) the players to replace ALL the equipment for his entire party at every level up.  That's not just annoying and a bit pace-breaking, but it also has the not irrelevant side effect to make you feel like no piece of equipment you'll find, no matter how strong at that given moment, gives you any long-term value.   There were surely better ways to handle these aspects, even just looking at the past. This game with the Baldur's Gate 2 itemization could have been a all-times classic."

Butcher Pete,231,37,7,"September 20, 2016",Recommended,159.7,"I played the first Divinity: Original Sin, and now I have played Divinity: Origin Sin 2 to completion (or to, at least, completion when it comes in terms of what is available in the alpha), and yet I am considering picking it up for a second run.  The combat of this game is excellent, and - I believe - is its shining feature.  And if you think you are particularly good at it there is now even a PvP arena in DOS 2.  With that said, if you did not like DOS 1, you will probably not like DOS 2.  The game is the same formula, practically the same combat system (with a few improvements and a few setbacks), and really the same story-quality of the first game.  You might find the story a little disappointing if you bought into all the hype that Larian threw down about hiring so many writers, when really what you are looking at is pages and pages of written dialogue (no voice acting) that you will probably begin to skip through six hours into the game.  And I say that as someone who loves books (Andrej Sapkowski's Blood of Elves is sitting right next to my keyboard).  But, look on the brightside: it's still early access right?  They could improve it... well, at least we can hope.  While I certainly have enjoyed DOS 2 for its combat, graphics, and character design... the story is not going to win any awards if it stays in its current form.  If that is going to be a deal breaker for you then I suggest you wait until the game is finished and see how it is then.  But if a badass combat system is enough to draw you in, then I'll see you in the arena!  (Oh, by the way, I should mention that the lizards in this game look really, REALLY badass... and sexy. :3)"

Choices mattered in those games.  If you ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up a quest, the game would make damn well sure you knew it ‚Äì and felt it.

"Sir Kirby, the Radio Pheasant",105,39,2,August 5,Recommended,187.2,"This game is as close to 10/10 as possible: There are plenty of encounters that play off each other, and impact that can be had from simple interactions you might not think much of. The amount of interplay from this game is absolutely amazing, and I'm almost certain you can have hundreds of hours and still miss some really small nuanced things in the game.  I came into this game never having played the first, and I still absolutely loved it. Single player is completely awesome, even if a bit more work, but if you have a group of friends to play this with? All the more awesome.  The following review is spoken without ever touching modding, or anything beyond the base campaign.  Some complaints that you should be on the lookout for: -Grasping the spell interactions can be a bit steep when starting out for mages. (For instance, you may poison your undead tank to heal them, and then hit them with a spell called Fortify which can remove your heal) -Sometimes, you can be roped into conversation with a character who isn't your pursuasion char, and then be forced to spill spaghetti and rope your team into a fight -Line of sight will 9 times out of 10 kill you, and you can only cry a single tear as the NPC sometimes snipes you through solid walls -Spell mileage will vary greatly from the player to the computer (a charmed/taunted npc may cheese out their turn, where you will seemingly always be forced to do something absolutely silly and try to kill yourself) -Whenever your characters are charmed/taunted, they *will* absolutely destroy your inventory full of consumables (though they will *always* use your rain scrolls first) -In later levels, with lots of particle effects and interactions, the computer may take quite a bit of time in deciding their turns -Sometimes, depending on how good your computer is, you can have a very unstable game -Some playstyles aren't quite viable. (For instance, a battle mage is ""possible"", but not really ideal, as you end up splitting damage over physical/magical resistance, which makes Crowd Control nigh impossible, as the real damage from physical/magical spells comes out when you are hitting their Hit Points directly) -Spirit vision (a thing that lets you talk with ghosts) is great from a lore perspective, but it can be easy to forget how versatile it is if you're not actively thinking about it; and if you're actively thinking about it, you pretty much have to spam it and walk across the world hoping you don't miss a fun little lore tid-bit. -Some fights are just straight up brutal if you don't quite know what's going on, all I can say is don't be afraid to google a bit of help if you're really struggling  Despite the complaints above, those really are just minor inconvinences which you'll have from time to time. Think of them like speedbumps in the middle of a really awesome racetrack. Like, you can't deny the rest of the racetrack how awesome it is, though you sometimes wish you could run it without the speedbumps. (Fingers crossed that some grievances will be removed in the Enhanced Edition) Pros: -After the initial learning curve, you basically get to sit back and relax and explore an amazingly intricate world of well written, well voiced, beautifully animated and beautifully built NPCs and the world they live in. -You get a lot of self-insertion capability, either playing the righteous hero, or scourge of the land.    And now for a fun story with minor spoilers:  So I'm playing Beast On the last legs of his life being beaten up unfairly by 3 condecending copies of Amadia, and 1 of Duna he's shackled he's maimed he's crippled he's floored he's on fire he's an inch from death our team long since abandoned him save for one lovely summoner Fane and his Incarnate ""Waga"" Champion in a true heroic moment tried to send a charge of battering ram to knock them all down but no one got to see what happened after the champion charged all 4 members of our divinty crashed as soon as the spell was cast 11/10, would get rekt again  "

You have the Pin system for the Zone Map but if we could do smaller temporary local Pings that would be super helpfull, or have the ability to draw fading lines on the minimap or on the ground.    Great game though!"

Narayan,698,32,4,February 8,Recommended,172.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a true modern cRPG. Instead of just emulating the Infinity Engine itself, it preserves the old school soul and complexity, includes all the things you would expect from ye olden days, adds many positive surprises on top of it, then frames them into amazing shiny 3D visuals with functional UI and tons of convenience. Even though there is number 2 in the title, it can be played as a standalone game without prior knowledge of the previous OS, or others in the Divinity series.  The game world is just packed with stuff to do - every few steps you bump into something new happening. And that‚Äôs above and below ground, as the game features quite a lot of caves, dungeons, ancient ruins, cellars, and even a pocket universe. The player has always plenty options to chose from how to proceed. Abilities like persuasion or lockpicking are really useful, and talking to animals is just awesome. The story is serious in tone, with many mature subplots, but it‚Äôs not lacking some needed moment to moment humor either (usually when doing side missions, not as unnecessary comic relief to main line). There are many memorable characters & situations. The companions are great and well fleshed out, each of them quite distinct. Their stories often intertwine with the main plot, so they all feel relevant.  While the game is fantasy in nature, and there are plenty of things we‚Äôre used to, there are also many quirks and ideas unique only to this world. Enough for it to feel fresh most of the time.  It‚Äôs not perfect though (but close). There are limits to what you can do, although there is very high chance you'll be able to execute most plans you come up with. The pacing was a little weird as well - the 2nd area with Driftwood was just too huge and not particularly structured. They might have been aiming at more open feel after the initial island, but it just turned out to be tiring by the end of it, and I couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of there. I‚Äôm aware that if I wasn‚Äôt a person hell bent on scouring every inch of the map, and doing absolutely everything, I might feel otherwise, but that‚Äôs just the way I like to play, so that part didn‚Äôt mesh well with my game style. I had to take a break a bit after that, but later areas, Nameless Isle and Arx were great again :)   Part of that issue might have been due to combat, there was just too much of it for my taste. The combat at first is quite confusing, since many useful skills are too spread out between different lines, and it introduces some new concepts like surfaces. Then you get the hang of it, and it‚Äôs fun for some time, and later on you get overwhelmed by sheer amount if it. There are many epic fights all right, but at the same time, even though I appreciated the variety and scope of them, sometimes I just wanted to get it over with and progress a bit faster (turn based battles can take a while).  But overall D:OS2 is simply outstanding. Highly recommended :)  Written after 173 hours played & 84 of 97 (87%) achievements earned. "
Grant,376,69,3,September 3,Recommended,114.0,"I will try to keep this review short and sweet.  Generally speaking - I am not a fan of turn based games. I prefer real time RPG Combat found in games like Skryim, Fallout, and Witcher 3 (The GOAT).   With that being said, even with it not being my favorite combat method, this game is INCREDIBLE. The story and choice making you can make is very similar to Fallout : New Vegas, where each dialogue matters and has an impact.   In terms of replayability, you can choose across multiple ""Origin"" characters, who all have deep back stories and the ability for you to influence the future on a very large scheme.   If you like RPGs where you get to make choices, this ranks up in the top 3 for me, which are Fallout : New Vegas, Witcher 3, and Divinity : Original Sin 2.   If you've taken the time to read this entire review, take the plunge and invest the time in this game, because it is insanely good."
Separomaturi,219,56,3,"December 26, 2016",Recommended,78.4,"After spending hundreds of hours playing D:OS, I can confidently say that D:OS 2 improves nearly every aspect of the original's gameplay.  Without spoiling any of the story so far, I can at least comment on the richness of the added mechanics, and the undeniable feel of polish added to the user interface, character creation, and combat.  The co-op works great for 2, 3 or even 4 players, my friends and I were able to jump straight-in without any issues.  Highly recommend."

Sarlic,336,43,0,"September 18, 2016",Recommended,152.5,"EDIT:  Below this edit is the original review I made during Early Access. Currently I would have to say 100% of my issues with the game in the early access were addressed even before the release. The AI has been improved to the point they make choices a skilled player may make. The Mass AP issue has been entirely resolved. The issue with certain skills not being balanced as in Hailstorm, Single Dagger and others have all been rebalanced and made entirely fair.   To add to this they have outdone themselves by adding FULL voice acting in the game, something that was only in the first one after the enhanced edition. The mechanics for the undead are entirely fleshed out. The storyline is entirely fluid and fleshed out. I can honestly say this game has not only met but exceeded my every expectation is entirely justified in its price for the quality put into it. Larion Studios has released a game that shows what EARLY ACCESS should be used for and it's benefits. I whole heartedly look forward to their next game.  EARLY ACCESS ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'll start by saying that I am well aware it's early access so some features are clearly not available as of yet.  The game is indeed an improvement overall to the first game, the combat is more fluid and challenging however I do see an issue in the fact the AI seemingly has collosal amounts of AP and can walk halfway across the field and still attack. This was an issue in the first game as well though and not a fault in D:OS2.  Even the very first goal of chapter one can be suceeded in so many ways including simple brute force if you happen to be a tactical genius. The added Highground vs Lowground bonus/penalty for ranged attacks in a great addition as it adds other dimension to the tactics in combat.   My greatest complaint is really just a matter of not being able to test out the true customization of the character classes. I also admit that the first town in D:OS seemed to have so much more to do but I do enjoy the more serious and adult approach of D:OS2.  All in all I genuinely believe the game is worth picking up, not necessarily saying people should buy it now at full price but it will definitely be a game worth playing with your friends. Albeit a very unforgiving game."
Sgt. Steak,122,79,5,June 11,Recommended,147.7,"ForenoteI apologize if this review doesn't appear as crisp as others on this page, as I don't write them often. That said, I feel this is one that absolutely warrants doing so. I'll attempt to spare you copious amounts of gushing in favor of clearer, more concise points as I go, though you should be aware that I've always had a weakness for games like this. Your mileage, as it will in all things, may vary.   Positives Craftsmanship: Excellent! Clear attention to detail and passion funneled into worldbuilding. There is a lot to see, hear and learn in Rivellon, and you'd be amazed at where and from whom this knowledge comes from.   Character depth: Glaringly flawed in some areas, but otherwise great! Whether pre-built avatars or enlisted as companions in the game itself, the game's cast of characters is unique and brimming with their own motives, thoughts and ideas. Likewise, those you do take with you aren't just along for the ride, and will actively attempt to make an impact on your adventure.  Nuance and Build Variety: Excellent! Anything is possible (within some very loose limitations) provided you're willing to work to put it together.  Gameplay: Good! Turn-based strategy type combat similar in nature to XCOM, with some departures in the form of such things as character-specific initiative. Larian's systems have a few issues, though, and a fair number of them can be really, really frustrating to deal with.  Story: Great! Not the most amazing story I've experienced, but definitely worth the time. It doesn't pull punches, and if nothing else, it is profoundly immersive.  Graphics: Excellent! Far above and beyond what is often expected of this genre, and despite the abundance of particle effects and bodies on screen, it runs smoothly to boot.  Soundtrack: Fair! Nothing to write home about, sadly. It can absolutely set up a mood, but it never struck me as anything I'd carry with me beyond the game itself. Negatives Equality of Companion Storytelling: Not every character was written equal, and it shows. Some have little to no impact on the story overall, while others quite literally change the perspective of everything going on. Taking those that land in the former category invariably trades interesting character dialogue, interations and bonding for what has the potential to be some of the more interesting tid-bits about the lore, important figures and what-not.  Gameplay: Inconsistent autosave mechanic makes it easy to lose hours of progress if you're not particular about saving over and over again. Items acquired during that lost time are not guaranteed to exist upon a reload, nor will they have the same stats as the game rerolls everything you do not presently own each time you reload. Initiative can be annoying and it creates opportunities for more powerful enemies to murder a member or members of your party before you can even act, if you aren't careful.  'Endgame': I feel no shame in admitting Divinity's stronger moments are in its first half, where you're getting to know the world and the people you're traveling with. A lot of crazy, fantastical things happen, but it all serves to further motivate you to seek out the real and honest truth. Sadly, however, a lot of the payoff isn't quite as stellar as I was hoping it'd be. In an effort to keep from spoiling anything, I'll clip this bullet with: Some of the final decisions can feel a little forced, and as resolutions approach, it becomes painfully obvious that, as above, not all companions and characters were written equal. Overall Divinity, in spite of what are ostensibly minor flaws (with the exception of some of the story-related notes), is a game that I wholeheartedly reccomend if you're a fan of the top-down dungeon crawler/RPG style of game. It has a lot of heart, and the world is very well put together. While there are some inconsistencies, some painfully overt 'nyah nyah' moments with the game's villains, and a general undertone of slight predictability to its story, it pulled me in and got me hooked on all the little details it had to offer. My only major gripe from a roleplaying standpoint is how... well, for lack of a better word, weak some of the resolutions are. At best, it can feel a little forced and at worst, some of the endings to several of the arcs in my playthroughs struck me as outright betrayals of everything that had been built up. In an effort to avoid spoilers (beyond what little I already have), this is something best experienced and decided in person.   As for gameplay, Divinity offers a rather open-ended system that can be tweaked and paired in a vast number of ways. It helps keep combat engaging, and it offers a great deal of replayability, as there are always new ways to try tackling different situations. That said, it has some very serious flaws that I found somewhat stifling, not the least of which being encounters with tougher enemies with a party that wasn't solidly invested in high initiative scores. Others, such as strange inconsistencies with line of sight, action points and other integral mechanics were certainly noticeable, but hardly game-breaking. Not much of a change from the first game there, I'm afraid.  In all, I'd rate this a 4/5. I would have been comfortable paying more than its asking price for the experience I got."

Dank Knight,397,89,5,February 2,Recommended,184.4,"NOTE:This is my experience after 45 hours into the game on Tactician difficulty, mostly solo. So the review is subject to changes.  PROS: (Oh boi, where do I begin from) +Looks very good visually and boasts equally good music. +Deep character customisation and progression. +Complex, intricate systems that let you experiment and even break the game. This lends to a lot of player freedom and agency. +Staggering attention to detail. +Quests are plenty and missable. There are multiple approaches and outcomes to every quest. +Chaotic, tactical combat along with clever AI scripting +The amount of replayability is off the charts! This is one game which requires multiple runs to experience everything.  CONS:-Some UI issues, where I had to click on a combat skill multiple times for the game to register it. A minor nitpick.  VERDICT:Simply put, Divinity Original Sin 2 IS the best role-playing game that makes The Witcher 3 look like a generic open-world title. What you get is an impossibly interactive game world where every action seems possible, and has consequences with such a level of complexity and flexibility it‚Äôs difficult to believe it exists, let alone that it could ever be bettered.  Its scope can be intimidating, but not overwhelming, and there‚Äôs usually a way to fix a mistake.  And it‚Äôs that intimidating, ambitious scope, that dedication to player freedom, that makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so impressive.  There isn‚Äôt another game right now that lets you do so much.   This is an easy 10/10. Buy it, play it and fall in love with RPG's all over again."

Darxim,122,34,2,"November 16, 2016",Recommended,498.8,"[Updating review from Early Access]  Almost all of the negative reviews of this game remark that they gave negative review for one of two reasons: 1. Game has too many bugs. 2. Game is too difficult.  That first one is fair.  There are a lot of bugs.  I'm currently not actively playing it due to this.  With this game's ambitious scope, bugs are expected.  Although, relative to a Bethesda game, this game was practically bug-free at release.  The second point, however, is just stupid.  tl;dr: It's not.  When you start the game, you choose your difficulty.  If Tactician is too hard for you, play Classic.  If Classic is too hard for you, play Explorer.  If Explorer is too hard for you, I'm surprised you're able to operate a computer at all.  I started one game on Explorer just to find something out that I couldn't where I was in my game (it was crafting related), and I was killing most things in one hit.  How is this difficult for you?  Honestly, I think it's just people playing on Tactitican because they think they're awesome, then get their asses handed to them because they're not.  I've seen people claim that Act 1 is impossible on Tactician.  Keep in mind that people had already beaten the entire game on Tactician when these claims were made.  If you want an easy game, I would say that this game is not for you, but Explorer mode is available, and it is a really good game, so you should probably still play it.  Another complaint I've seen, although it's rare, is about the level bloat.  I agree with this complaint.  There is way too big a difference between one level and the next, and the steepness of the curve makes it a lot worse.  The game would be a lot better without it.  I can understand the power increase from leveling being on a curve, as that's normal, but the curve is too damn high."

Harkening back to the golden era of Fallout, Planescape: Torment, Baldur's Gate and the likes, it fully deserves to stand alongside those greats.   It's hard to explain how enjoyable the game is. It refines and improves almost everything from the original Divinity: Original Sin. The attention to detail, environments, quests, voice acting, combat, etc are all fantastic. The addition of multiplayer is absurdly fun and just the sheer variety the game offers is something else entirely. It's such a smooth RPG experience but so polished, and still retains the things that made old school CRPGs so great.

Only 2 writers for Divinity Original Sin, there's triple that for this and voicing the game would take years. Conversations feel a lot more in depth too and I found myself voluntarily reading it as opposed to just skipping, which is what I ended up doing on Original Sin (not that it was boring, I loved the voice acting, just got very tedious in my opinion).

federated state of trollnesia,158,80,5,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,51.7,"Some pretty severe balancing problems really hurt this game on the harder difficulties at the moment I write this review. It definitely seems like melee-heavy parties are not very viable. I've restarted three times now and reduced my party's melee investment with each restart and I've been progressively enjoying the combat more as a result. Basically, melee at least so far in the first act, do not have mobility skills they need to do anything. Attacks of opportunity require a trait investment, which is kind of lame. It doesn't help armored enemies mitigate a lot of melee damage and that getting magic resistance as a fighter is difficult, resulting in a lot of annoying CC from numerous enemies.  I've had to cheese a lot of my fights to win them (abusing conversation mechanics mostly) and it feels kind of bad.  The game is still fun, but I would advise doing research about party composition before investing a lot of XP.  Also, this game commits a lot of ""cardinal sins"" for me: 1. Persuading people down from fights...results in a net XP loss and no notable change in the story's outcome (at least so far); as far as I can tell, being a murderous bastard is the best way to play this (by far, even). Aside from meager barter prices I don't see a point in making a charismatic character. 2. You're encouarged to fight and kill trash for XP; at multiple parts in the first act instead of advancing the story like I wanted to, I was compelled to scour the area for more things to kill. If you like this, then this is the game for you. Reminds me a lot of Baldur's Gate in that regard. 3. Some party members, if you don't keep them on a short leash, will break quests for you by doing naughty things to NPCs. 4. Quests break...and there's no notification about it. It's basically a missing thread. It's kind of interesting this way, leaving you to figure out how to resolve the quest, but if there's no way to resolve it, you'll never know for sure. So be careful when you go murdering people who might be connected with a quest. This is definitely preferable over Skyrim's ""everyone is invulnerable"" bullcrap, but I'd like to know when I've royally ruined everything and should reload. 5. A lot of game mechanics aren't forshadowed at all (one of the early fights has turtles which...explode for a ton of damage when you kill them, really great surprise when you have a lot of melee in your party) and you'll be reloading after you experience them. 6. Numerous boss weapon drops so far for me have been inferior to standard stuff I find in shops. It's funny (not in a way I like), this one notable enemy I killed dropped a dagger which had a ""10% bleed chance"" mod on it - and that was supposed to be the draw for me using it I guess? In a turn based strategy game, ""10% anything"" might as well as not be there. There are a lot of other lukewarm mods on gear that might as well not be there or do anything. I've been vendoring a lot of stuff. 7. Gold isn't super abundant, so you will be picking up pots, pans, and kitchen sinks to make by. I've never liked this as it's just absolutely silly and tedious.   Depsite my gripes, this is definitely a solid RPG and tactics game, at least the most of what we can expect from 2017."

Also I'm not sure on this Source pt system.  Granted you do not get much access to it till the end of Act 1 but I'm hoping this won't be something that is finite in the game.

Prime,180,26,0,"October 20, 2017",Recommended,119.1,"This game made me excited to play games again. I love it, 10/10. Okay, maybe not. Assigning a number score is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing useless anyway. I will just be critical of this game and probably talk more about the things I dislike as opposed to the things I do, everyone has already gushed enough about this game. I think it is one the best RPGs of this generation, but it's not perfect.  Extremely open ended, with lots of possible ways to approach a given objective (encounter/quest etc.) which opens up a lot of possible playstyles/roleplay choices. This however, does introduce a lot of broken sh*t, the quest log being one glaring example and I have broken a few enounters by doing X when I should have done Y first  for some arcane reason .  Characters are well written, although all the fantasy cliches are there, they are subversive to those tropes in places and each main character has a nicely rounded theme/character arc. Writing in general is nuanced and mature, serious in tone but not lacking in humour a la classic Larian. Main Quest has some interesting ideas and dynamics, but kinda falls apart by the end of act 3 imo  (Act 3 feels very endgame, only for the main villian to pull out a dues ex machina 'lolz gotcha!', only played up to the begining of act 4, so who knows, might redeem itself in the end)    Combat is a little different from Original Sin 1 because of the inclusion of the Armour system. It prevents turn 1 CC deciding battles, and I think it makes you think a bit more tactically during the initial turns but overall I think the system needs some improvements as your mindset going into each battle remains mainly the same, and it also makes some builds pretty trash (tanks, phys/ele hybrids etc). I like saving throws in D&D, a hybrid system where, for example, armour values influenced saving throws would work better imo.  I am not a fan of the character development, way too much number creep (going to the next levels means each piece of gear is instantly outclassed), gear isn't really that intersting, just get some +stats and maybe a free non-unique skill. Vitality/armour/damage scale way too high and picking stats comes down picking whatever gives you the damage multipliers for your skills. Not really engaging or meaningful. Thankfully these points can be easily solved by using mods, but mods don't influence my opinion on the design philosophy of the base game.  Tactician mode is kinda busted, maybe I need to git gud, maybe my fun Nice BuildsTM do not abuse mechanics enough. Classic mode gets too easy, too quickly. Woe is me.  Mods pls fix   Overall though, this is on par with some of the best in the genre, and Larian should be commended for their ethical kickstarter/development process. The director has alluded to extra content in the future and has admitted to some flaws so thumbs up again."

rick.activemd,166,51,2,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,174.3,"So I feel I have enough information to give a well-informed review now that I'm 36.2 hours in. I've been reading, however, that if you haven't left the island yet, you are still in the tutorial! Immediate kudos for a content-packed game.  Having played the original Divinity tile from 2002, I've seen this game develop from a Diablo-esque point-and-click action RPG to the turn-based strategy game that is now Divine Divinity: Original Sin 2. Although I've missed a game or two since then, I wasn't quite sure what the storyline was, but the game clearly helps you understand what's been going on in the world of Rivellon right from the start. The immediate immersion into the game has the amazing quality to have me asking questions and wanting to seek out the answers to those questions. I was compelled to keep playing as I see the story unfold and each decision leads to more tangled pieces of the web of mystery that I need to solve.  The combat was easy to figure out immediately and I have to give Larian Studios another amazing pat on the back for integrating Full Controller Support for a turn-based isometric RPG. One of my big turn-offs is that, although I've played for keyboard and mouse combo for many years, I like my gamepad much better and will not buy any titles that don't support it.  There's some dispute about the Tactician mode and whether or not it's too hard. Having played 8 hours in Tactician mode, I finally discovered that if I wanted to enjoy the game and be able to progress in it, that I would have to play in Classic mode. Even in Classic Mode, the fights are still difficult and I've had to play a few of those, get killed multiple times, go level up my characters and improve my gear, and then finally win. Sometimes winning just barely with half my party killed.  The character creation was a little strange from most RPGs I've played, since you aren't really locked into a particular class and you can be whatever you want, based on the allocation of your Talents and Skills. I chose to play as origin character Ifan ben-Mezd, since I wanted to find out more about the storyline and how people fit into it. The build-selection during character creation made it easy to figure out what Skills and Talents were appropriate for the style of play you wanted for your main character. I always choose a good combination of melee and magic, so Battlemage was perfect for me.  Character dialogues have an added flair to them that give you extra choices based on certain tags you have or aquire or choices specific to certain origin characters.  The voiceovers are amazing and abundant, even down to having your own personal narrator. Many RPGs don't put that level of artisitic detail into their games when it comes to audio choices.  The environment is beautifully rendered and I enjoy it in full 4K resolution on my 65in. television. Full camera control with zoom in and out makes the environment easy to navigate.  Overall notes about Divinity: Original Sin 2:  * Content-packed (packed like it could rival the amount of content in Skyrim) * Mysterious and interesting storyline that makes you want to keep playing * Combat system is easy to figure out, but beware of Tactician Mode (was too hard for me) * Full Gamepad Support in a turn-based RPG (a rare find...I would play Tyranny if it had  Gamepad support) * Detailed voiceovers and soothing soundtrack * Great-looking environment that scales well to 4K resolutions  I hope this review helps someone!"

Tamaster,561,40,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,234.5," Review - Divinity: Original Sin 2  ===   RATING: 9.5 / 10 Legendary. There is no other word for it.   Overview Divinity Original Sin 2 (from now DOS2) is the second installment of the Original Sin saga, developed by Larian Studios first time a couple years ago. Veteran RPG makers as they are, they come a long way since they made the first Divine Divinity back in the early 2000's, and also the following chapters which all were good games (No, Beyond Divinity never existed, shhh). DOS2 is a real time RPG with turn based combat, with some new twists in the classic mechanics to keep it modern.  ===   Gameplay Analysis   General Gameplay  There is so much to say about the gameplay of DOS2, there really is. First of all, the thing that astonished me the most among all the good ones, which are really a lot, is the incredible freedom given to the player in all his actions and interactions with NPCs and eventual co-op players alike. The freedom DOS2 offers is as close as it can get to pen-and-paper RPG level of freedom transported in a videogame: every NPC is killable, everything can be stolen, companions will react on what you do based on their alignement and may even become your enemies (and so can do players you fplay with in multiplayer!), there are a myriad of different dialogue options suitable for any alignment you might want to role-play about, unique dialogues for each of the story NPCs, unique race-based ones, unique background-based ones, reputation based ones... so i mean, there are so many unique combinations and things that can happen that every play-through will be very different as far as interactions go, it's all about what you do and who you are, in this Larian did a wonderful job and very few other RPGs ever have been at the same level of depth in interactions.  Other than this, gameplay is pretty much straightforward and like any other classic RPG: explore a very vast world composed of 3 huge areas, plus all the dungeons and secret places of course, loot from randomly generated pieces of gear (except unique ones, those are always the same), fight a good variety of enemies each with its own features, and mind you enemies are very different from one another in this game so you will have to use new strategies a lot, solve quests in various ways depending on your alignment of just on how you feel like doing, but remember everything has some consequences.  If i was to explain in detail all the gameplay, this would be a very very long review and would go over the Steam word limit, so i tell you this: there have maybe been 2-3 RPGs in the whole history that match the depth this one offers, don't miss it.    Combat System  Combat in DOS2 is turn based and very much classic style. Every character starts with a fixed AP number each turn (excluding buffs and debuffs of course) and they are used for both movement and actions. There is no Mana in Divinity OS2, just cooldowns for all skills, and for some, a special type of energy is required.  The new mechanics Larian decided to introduce in OS2 are mainly about how armor works: in DOS2 there are two types of armor, Magical and Physical, which act like additional health bars and nullify any debuff or damage from that specific source (magical armor counters magical damage and magical debuffs, and so on) as long as it has 1 point at least. Once an Armor is depleted it can be regenerated with some skills and potions, but while down, Debuffs and negative statuses will always afflict the targeted character, there is no such thing as success percentage, it just matters if you have still Armor or not. The elimination of RNG this way is a quite clever gameplay change, but also comes with some issues we will discuss further on.  Other than that, rest assured, there are plenty of skills and fighting schools for all tastes, from warriors to healers to summoners, there are something like 150+ skills around to build your very custom characters the way you want.    Content  Immense. There is no way you can do everything in one play-through, you will have (and want to) play this game multiple times to get all the interactions, quests, and so on. To make just one play it can very well require above 85 hours, to complete the game 100%, can require more than 200.     Balancing  There just is one but quite serious issue with balancing: based on how the Armor mechanic is structured, it is logical to think that a party basing all its damage on either Physical or Magical would defeat enemies much quicker than splitting damage between example, 2 magical and 2 physical characters. And it is exactly how it is: a party based on just 1 type of damage is much more efficient, maybe too much, in combat and can defeat most enemies with much more ease than a ""standard"" party with some magical and some physical damage.    Challenge  Tactician difficulty, the hardest, is a serious challenge if taken without the proper respect. Badly built parties will be wiped with ease and requires planning, strategy in combat and experience. Some fights really impressed and got me on the brink of madness, let me tell you, and i play RPGs since twenty years! Luckily the unlimited and free re-spec at your base and adjustable difficulty will make the game beatable even for the less experienced.  ===   Technical Analysis   Graphics  Environments and art of cutscenes are really well done. Bear in mind this game does not make graphics one of its priorities, still the visuals are quite stunning in certain environments, particle effects are well done, character models are alright, armor and weapon models are made with particular care.  The world on DOS2 is vibrant and alive, the ccharacterization of the various environments and locations is marked very distinctively, it all contributes to the immersion feeling you already get from the roleplaying part.    Sound  It is to mention that Larian decided to voice act EVERY SINGLE DIALOGUE of this game, and there are a monstrous quantity. The voice acting is also good. This alone is a huge plus. other than this, the music and sound effects are at very good standards for an RPG, no really, they are good.    Performance  Performance is alright, the game is optimized well enough but can become heavy for low to mid end machines because it renders and makes all the characters in a whole area work together at the same time so it requires some computing power some machines might not have to run everything smooth.  Also when saving the game has some inexplicably huge frame drops.    Stability  DOS2 is not really unstable, it crashes sometimes, it is bound to happen, but rarely. There are no particular stability problems.    AI  Enemy AI is one of the best i've ever seen around. They will execute complex maneuvers to get the most efficiency out of just about everything. Think of this: enemies will get shoulder attacked to walls to avoid being back-stabbed if they are supports or ranged units and there is a rogue in the enemy team. How often you see this? Never. This is the level of AI i'm talking about, the same AI that curses you with healing is damage to bypass your shield and kill you with your own healing the next turn.  Prepare to be impressed.    Quality of Life  Inventory management and interfaces are generally good, but one thing is really bad: picked up new items will constantly clutter your hotbar and having to always clean it is a chore... there is a mod that solves this (blessed modding!) but as far as the vanilla game goes this is an issue.    Bugs / Issues  Sometimes enemies will just get stuck in combat if the pathfinding becomes too complex or if they are teleported / thrown / whatever in locations they cannot walk down from. In Act 3 some voice lines and dialogues are broken and do not work properly."

Shit Stain,441,19,0,"January 25, 2017",Recommended,83.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 improves on almost everything gameplay wise from the first game.  No longer do you have to deal with unfair elemental damage and debuffs that one-shot you, instead there's a new armour system that blocks this kind of damage more reliably, both physical and magical. This new system makes it so you manipulate the battlefield to your advantage more so than just spamming out CC spells on the enemies.  Combat is a lot smoother as they are both extremely aggressive but at the same time tactical as you aim your attacks. With the new armour system you will rely more on throwables and the environment to lower the opponents armour so that you can start controlling them with stuns or burning them.  A new addition are dialogue checks which are similar to the checks present in old isometric Fallout games where your statistics determine your ability to have a successful persuasion chance. Be careful who you use to talk to certain NPCs as now the checks are decided by your main stats and not only your persuasion stat.  Now the game is out of early access I really have to commend Larian for creating a fantastic game. They changed a few of the early fights so that they aren't too broken but at the same time switching it up enough to still make it challengeing. The new additions of polymorph skills and generous placement of source as well as tons of crafting recipes really shows Larian's commitment to making an amazing game.  Never before have I marveled at the magnificence and brilliance of an RPG as much as Divinity: Original Sin 2.  The freedom, progression, story and overall game mechanics makes this one of the best games I've ever played."

That's how much I looked forward to the game and I have to say, its the best purchase ever.   I usually wait for a discount before buying the game but this one is without a doubt WORTH the price tag. This game may seem overwhelming at first but that's what makes it sooo much fun in my opinion. Its what brings replayablitiy to the game. The glorious and satisfying combat just makes you want to keep coming back for more. There's nothing like freezing a puddle and then have Ifan trip over it. GODWOKEN DAMNIT IFAN!

DirtyBrownTaco,474,28,2,March 13,Recommended,71.0," Divinity: Original Sin 2 has been an utter delight from start to finish.  I use no hyperbole when I say this is the best RPG I've played thus far.   Pros   Fantastic score. Whether it be running around Fort Joy, taking in the sights on the Lady Vengeance, or amid an intense battle, the music sticks with you all the way through. I've been listening to some tracks repeatedly since first hearing them.   One of the deepest RPGs in terms of choice. A task such as escaping an island ends up having a plethora of options for you to achieve your goal. Want to sneak through a secret dungeon guarded by fire slugs? Sure why not. Want to get out simply by taking a boat? Go for it! Oh what's that? You want to cheat the system and simply teleport yourself and party into various edges until you manage your way out? You got it!   Wonderfully engaging story; filled with plenty of characters that are hard to forget. Don't forget the pet pal perk to talk to all of those animals around you! (Beware, you will be sad a lot of times talking to them.) Off put by the concept of reading a ton of dialogue? (Why are you buying this...) then worry not! Every single character (and animal) is fully voiced with some amazing VO work. However, the story did let me down in a few small ways, but I'll get to that soon.   Mods mods mods! The community has been excellent at coming up with some very inventive and fun mods to use throughout your adventure. Anything from new classes, new spells, revamping certain systems, and if you're a glutton for punishment - mods that make the game even harder. Cons  Remember how I mentioned how amazing the story was? Yeah, well that‚Äôs for the majority! As some others have mentioned, going into the final act and ending, there are some definite inconsistencies with the quality of writing and apparently attention to lore. (I've never played any other Divinity games;  I was unaware until doing further research.) For a game that boasts such a wide range of choices and how they really matter; the ending(s) seemed largely basic and almost unrelated to your adventures throughout the game.   Technical problems. Any game of this size will be bound to suffer from some technical issues, I completely get that. Overall, it was nothing major - apart from one game breaking bug I encountered causing some invisible enemies to 1 hit KO me, but luckily, I had a save from not long before that I managed to get back to and the problem seemed to have fixed itself. While the bugs weren't outright angering - in the final act I did find myself getting increasingly peeved by the buildup of several small bugs affecting my experience. At times enemies will take AGES to take their turn - leaving you to simply sit there and watch them and their idle animation until they finally realize they should be doing something.    Tech probs cont. The camera and reticule would at times completely spaz out and throw itself in a random direction and would continue to do so whenever trying to target certain areas or enemies. This may have been due to some mods interfering with the code, but at times my journal would be completely wiped of all data - leaving me to have to remember what quests I still needed to do.   Balance issues. Exploring the various locales sometimes leads you into areas where you are WOEFULLY unprepared or situations that unless you had prior knowledge, are borderline impossible to defeat. While it didn't bug me too much, I frequently encountered some dialogue/enemies that upon entering the fight would instant kill my party, use the same skill numerous times with seemingly no cooldown like the heroes, or somehow know exactly the best way to take out a party member. (Did I mention I was playing on explorer? The 'easiest' mode of them all) In the end though, I loved this game and every single minute I put into it. Some problems did irk me enough to slightly lower my score, but ultimately, I'm marking this game down as one of my favorite RPGs of all-time.  9.5/10"
Ethrin,894,51,3,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,68.6,"I'm still working my way through the introduction of the game (haven't gotten past the first city), but so far I'm loving it! I'm playing on the Classic difficulty, and there are two difficulties higher than this one.  My characters are now level 7, but this is still an early review, as I have yet to complete act 1.  Pros: 1.) Combat is incredibly tactical. There have been a couple of fights where I got my butt handed to me because I didn't think to exploit the terrain or the destructibles placed in the battlefield.  Height matters a lot more in this game, especially if you have a huntsman. 2.) Oddly, the soundscape is amazing.  Walking through town you can hear the bustling of people walking around. It sounds great when you're in a dungeon, along the beach, and everywhere.   3.) Voiceovers, world building, and characters has been spot on so far.  I have found some characters to be really funny, and others to be incredibly intriguing, such as Losche. 4.) The game doesn't prevent you from doing things out of order.  Once you escape from Fort Joy, it really opens up and allows you to wander around the map in any direction.   Cons: 1.) Don't get me wrong, the UI is pretty well done in this game.  However, there are some UI'isms that I would like improved.  Such as being able to send all of my ""wares"" to one character (who has the highest bartering skill).   2.) Saved game bloat bug.  Right now there is an issue with saved games getting extremely bloated to the point where it can take a long time for my computer to upload the saved games to the cloud.    Closing Thoughts: This is definitely a CRPG that has had a lot of love and time put into it.  It will ask a lot of you (time wise) to get going, but so far, it has been a really enjoyable ride!  I definitely recommend it so far, and I will update as I get further into the game.  EDIT: Updated with some more pros and cons.

Halwin,838,156,5,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,190.5,"C'mon, become Overwhelmingly Positive already! While at the time of writing this review, I haven't even gotten past the first Act yet, I nevertheless feel compelled to write a review for this beautiful game. For me the game's highlight is its excellently designed turn-based combat. There are no potentially pesky RNG elements and therefore every fight follows the same strict rules allowing you to have full control over how every battle plays out. There's also an insane amount of skills that are open to each and every character, and free to combine at your leisure (half of the fun is simply experimenting!). While the game is very very challenging (in a good and fair way!), I never felt the need to look up guides as with some thought you are more than able to compose your own diverse team of heroes (except maybe on hard difficulty - but don't play that until you finished Classic!). The voice acting is also superb, with tons and tons of spoken dialogue and different choices you can make. Also initiating a dialogue with another of your team members may open up a whole different story which may reveal more of the character you are interacting with or the world around you. Finally, the graphics look more than impressive enough considering the game's genre, and the level design has nothing to complain about.  Admittedly, no game is without its flaws though and I will summarise my, minor, grievances here. Inventory management is still a hassle. It's a common issue for RPGs, and I'm not sure if there ever will be a game that's perfect in that regard, but with four party members, switching items to and fro, out and in of backpacks and the like, becomes a considerable hassle. Especially when it can be hard to discern between quest items, crafting materials, fluff, and junk. To add to that, civic skills like bartering and lucky charm (increases your chance to find rare items with that player only) are not group-wide, meaning that you will have to switch items (and gold) to and fro your characters yet again to reap the maximum gold and good gear. Frankly, I don't bother with the last two because it's a serious nuisance, and it doesn't really make the game too hard without. Nevertheless a fix to this inconvenience would be appreciated. Furthermore, certain skills are either useless - initiative: determines the play order during a fight for your team only, meaning that having one at 13, then 12, 11, 10 is sufficient and any extra points are basically lost, - or certain skills provide odd bonuses - warfare: a melee oriented skill that apparantly is the best damage increase for rangers as well (I do have a ranger in my team with 5 huntsman and 0 warfare however, and he's perfectly viable on Classic. I only need to make sure he's positioned with a height advantage, which is actually how the game intended rangers to be played). Last, but not least, there's no way to change party members during a conversation, meaning that if you are forced into a dialogue (probably because he/she was closest to the conversation starter) with someone and a persuasion check needs to be passed, it is impossible to have your player with skill in pursuasion take it over (this led to frequent quickloads for me). Basically during dialogue your team members turn into mutes unless they are scripted to take part in the conversation.   I didn't intend for the second paragraph to be longer than the first, and I would recommend to pay more focus to the great things this game offers rather than the minor nuisances. I will give this game a higher rating once some (or all) of these issues are addressed, which I actually expect they will.   TL;DR: A must buy even at full price! It currently has the well deserved spot of #10th best game ever!  P.S. Feel free to reply to this review with questions; I usually reply rapidly. Also, if you decided to buy the game after reading this I'd be happy to help you out with the game, or play with you co-op if our times align! :)  Rating: 9.0/10 Halwin's 100% Completion RecommendationDifficulty: Unsure, but considering honour mode achievement I expect 9/10.

This is a very traditional D&D styled RPG. This means that there'll be a lot of reading, a lot of exploring, puzzles and the game is generally quite difficult if you don't pay attention. As an older gamer this is a massive throwback to the games I played as a kid, but if you're into hardcore non stop action games this is not the game for you.

Great customisation / flexibility   Multiple solutions to major quests   No ""get me 10 bear hides"" and no visible fetch and carry questsReally refreshing to play, DOS2 is a pinnacle of its kind.

applekwisp,332,25,3,"December 14, 2017",Recommended,101.0,"Great RPG, probably one of the best games of 2017. It's strengths lie in an amusing colorful world, with and intresting, serious, yet lighthearted fantasy setting. The game is actually very rough around the edges the longer you play. It's polish runs out in the last 2 chapters as they feel rushed and maybe even unfinished. The difficulty curve of the game feels off since near the start it's very challenging, but towards the end you will become an unstoppable killing machine. Though there were many improvements over the first game, I still felt the first game had a better, focused story, better armor system, combat system (AP management) and pacing.  Pros  Lengthy RPG  Large variety of skills and character customization options  Dialogue is fun an intresting, a lot of world building in game  Combat is fun (though flawed). World skills like teleporting, pyramids, pickpocketing are intresting  Combat is very strategic (almost to a fault)  Very fair price for content. 100 hour playthrough doing every single quest I could. Cons  (Pro and Con I think) Teleport becomes a less useful skill in this game because of the availability of so many movement abilities to everyone.  A lot of broken achievements. Examples: pray at every altar on nameless isle, the quests associated with sebille, fane, most companions i assume  New armor system is bad. Encourages stacking either physical or magical damage. Late game it becomes irrelvant, everything is a one shot fest or everyone has an ability to completely strip your armor/magic resist  AP system is too limited compared to first game  Too many status effects and they are inconsistent. For example Rupture tendons can be used against armor, but bleeding will be blocked  Literally every battle will end covered in necrofire/fire. It makes bless a useless skill since it will ALWAYS be overwritten.  Source skills useless for first 2 areas, since you will never have enough source to use them (and wonder if they are worth saving for a truly difficult part that never comes) and overpowered for the rest of the game. Makes for a boring mechanic considering how central to the plot it is. Bless, source vampirism, and spirit vision aren't really compelling godwoken abilities honestly.  The story kind of forgets itself in the 2nd area. The game feels like a means to explore and do fun RPGeque quests, but the plot takes a backseat to it.  The final act feels unfinished. I felt like I ran into solutions to quests accidently more often than the ""correct"" way. Final battle and final choices don't feel like they were explained or fleshed out.  (EARLY SPOILER)The compnaion interaction with the game feels to forced. Everyone you meet is one of the most important people in the world. The companions who you don't pick early on, continuously show up even though you have no attachement to them at all.  Crafting, like in the first game, is exceptionally bad. You can never preview what the recipe is going to make. The receipe UI is super cluttered. Exiperimentaion is cumbersome. It's mostly luck based guessing, with a few ""skill books"". Good luck sorting through the UI with no search function or filters to get anything useful. Ignore the crafting system completely despite there being decent receipes like boots + nails, or status immunity potions. Overall a great game probably the GOTY, but I would reccomend people give the first game a chance beacuse I truly believe it is the better title between the two. A few of the characters and plot points carry over so it's worth taking into consideration before playing this game regardless. I feel like after a few patches, maybe an expansion, this game can be fixed up to be almost perfect, but for DOS is still the best example of kickstarter success and a modern CRPG with a classic taste to it."

Note when they join you get to choose their class (which is a great, original idea) but their race is fixed. Later on, you can respec all of their ability/talent/skill point selections if you want.  Items, equipment and enemies all seem quite interesting with lots of different stats and abilities. Controller(PS4,XBox) support is fantastic and it is fully playable via controller.

[FTA]TatsuyaSuou,289,131,20,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,114.8,"While there isn't a lot that hasn't already been addressed in other positive reviews, I feel obligated to address some of the negative reviews I continually see regarding the game's difficulty.  Like any strategy-oriented game, Divinity Original Sin 2 requires quite a bit of premeditation before entering combat to guarantee success (outside of Tactician mode anyway, more on that later).    The game expects you to use the tools it gives you in each encounter though the largest issue I've seen is when you enter a new section of the game.  Before you go exploring to much it's almost mandatory to address the guaranteed difficulty creep by checking out any and all new gear/skillbooks/potions etc are available in whatever new social area you encounter.  With the game's economy being what it is, having one character geared toward thievery and another set up with a significant amount of barter goes an incredibly long way toward alleviating the need to almost constantly upgrade your gear when entering a new section of the game.  The point I'm making is that the game gives you all the tools you need to address any gear issues you might have the moment you set foot in a new town. This goes for skill books as well as there is no limit to how many books you can learn as long as you have the commensurate ranks in the associated skill and sufficient memory slots to equip them.   Anyway, the TL;DR of all that is the game gives you all the tools you need to PREPARE for difficult fights so long as you actually use them.  All that said, the AI isn't a slouch.  It can and will abuse whatever environmental things are to hand and the devs have set up a great many of the fights to favor the enemies.  This means that as a player the onus is on you to think about the party you want to put together before just trying to breeze through the game.  There are so many ways to make strong characters in D:OS 2 that they're almost limitless.  What you CAN'T do and expect to be successful is to just blindly charge into every fight and new situation with your d*** at full mast (just a turn of phrase, no offense intended ladies).  If that's the playstyle you're after there are a dozen Diablo clones or ARPGs out there that are better suited to that frame of mind.  D:OS2 has a turned-based system for a reason and is incredibly rewarding just so long as you apply some forethought to engagements. In fact, it's easily the best RPG I've played since the early 2000s in terms of gameplay.   Panning a game for being difficult is a non-starter, especially when it's only as hard as you make it by lack of planning. Unless, of course, you're playing on Tactician mode.  If you're doing that, you deserve whatever mental anguish you're suffering from because that is almost entirely designed for masochists who like to sit bare‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•on a saguaro cactus.  If that's you, by all means, buy stock in razor blades or whatever but I would seriously hope to not see any complaints about difficulty."

I thought I was quite far in but turns out I've just scratched the surface. The depth is awesome, this is really the first game of this specific genre I have played, and I'm glad I took the risk on it. Incredibly immersing enviroments, music, story and characters. You really feel part of this world. Combat is very deep and I actually restarted the game twice before I was happy enough with my build and companions. Takes a bit of time if you are new to this series to get used to how classes and roles work, and how you should be building your team, but once you get the hang of it, it's fairly straightforward. The only negative I felt was that the journal gave a lack of direction on quests and objectives in general, but as soon as you stop treating them like quests and more like parts of a dynamic story it doesn't really matter. You can fail some, or do things wrong and that's okay it's part of your story. Often doing the wrong thing can get you some nice loot or information that helps you in some other way. Love it."

hawxace06,177,23,1,"June 7, 2017",Recommended,261.3,"On release everything seems to work perfectly for me. I have had no issues with the game at all, and even alone the voice acting is keeping me playing. Feel free to check some valid negative reviews for problems that will most likely be fixed. And remember, there is always the option to reload to rethink and plan. Lets hope this stays constant through the game.  Ok, the Quest Log is broken as mentioned alot. And I found a couple of bugs.  The devs are working to fix problems, but they just do not have enough people to find all the bugs. I am 100% sure the game will be fleshed out within a couple months.  I also have heard that act 3 is kind of broken in a way, which I will experience myself. So far everything is beautiful and feels good, the graphics, audio, story telling, companions and all the other stuffs. As someone who enjoys smething and goes back afterwords to see everything, this will be a great experience.    Early Access review: Before you buy: Please go play atleast some of the first game if you wanted to play this. It is finished so a new player can enjoy the full experience. I have just been reading people complain about the early access too much to ignore this.     Oh and I very strongly recommend getting a friend to join you (There is a 2 player pack I pretty sure if you are feeling generous.) Without a friend that you can enjoy playing with,the beginning will be a struggle as it is a bit misleading.     Also the game is difficult in a way that makes a person have to think critically, making a restart is inevitable unless you are either a master at these games or just have played it a while. Having another person to talk to about positioning and cc (main points of the game) really makes a restart less frusturating and more of a learning experience until you get into the groove.  If you get this game I seriously hope you enjoyed it as much as the first one. Although I haven't beaten it completely I have enjoyed every step of the teleporting mess that it is.  Also. If you can only buy one get this one. Both are really great though"

EDIT  And now since people started saying this isn't a review. no it is not it is simply a joke when i first started the game without any clue as to what i might end up with. i was at a moment of weakness when i just got my salary and came home drunk. so the next morning i started playing the game. here's an actual review based on my 9 hours of playtime.  the pros: -you have total freedom on how you want to play the game  (could also be seen as a con at times)  -indepth turnbased combat  (height matters and you have to anticipate that sometimes out from the shadows people can turn up to kill you)  -the origin characters have rich personality's and you don't really have to play as them to influence their story since they can also be your companions.  -story length.  there are 3 story acts that have a suprisingly long playtime and each time you want to replay it it's almost always different since like i said you have total freedom over what you will do. ( i play multiple characters but right now i am about 6 hours in on my undead witch and i haven't even come close to finish act 1 and from what i've heard of others act 1 can easily become 15 hours of playtime)  -OPTIMIZATION! this game's beautifull combat effects can clutter your whole screen and your computer (or laptop) can still run it smoothly  Now some small cons:  -*total freedom on how you play. sure is nice to play it however you want but... you must also discover each mechanic yourself (this is also how Grumps started a fight because i accidentally stole a book infront of the magister and also may have hit her with a knife before) also you can miss allot of story contents if you randomly kill people.  -tutorial is a bit vague sometimes and forgettable when you get too much on your plate because at same time you are fighting and trying to predict what your enemy is going to do.  after this there aren't many cons about this game that i can mention until i have actually experienced the full game and not just act 1. call me biased but just of the sheer size of the game you should try it. i can already sense this has allot of replay value."

However this game is not for you if you are bored by dialogue, this game is not for you if you dislike complexity and having to actually learn how to play and this game is not for you if you you require instant gratification.  For me, this game plays like a western version of a JRPG, with many characters to join your party, a deep complex story and many ways for you to affect the story.  The combat is turn based which allows for more depth in the combat system and more strategic options.  If you haven't tried turn based combat before, this is a great way to try it.  It's like Diablo but for intelligent adults.  Each origin character provides with a completely different gameplay experience even if you play them as the same class.

If you love story driven rpgs where the world you roam gives you adventure at every turn - this game is for you.   Positives: The myraid of ways you can build a character. I opted for more of a ""Warden"" route and enjoyed the freedom of veering outside of the confines of the usually locked in advancement systems found elsewhere.  The NPCs and their contribution to nearly every scene as well as their own storylines. I will admit I got a mod to allow me to take all of them along. Not so that the game would be easier but rather so I could experience all of their storylines in one playthrough. I was not disappointed. Best character development I have seen in an rpg in a long long time.  How big and developed the world is. Nearly every corner has you encountering some mystery, npc, adventure, or clue. Sometimes it can even be a little overwhelming but with time and effort - you can start mapping out everything.  The combat system. The built upon the previous one and improved its flaws. In the original, I would grenade and area effect arrow the hell out of everything. Sometimes allowed me to breeze through fights that should have required strategy. This time out - there isn't any overt easy tactics. In quite a few fights, you have to bring your strategy A game or die repeatedly.  Negatives Some of the puzzles got too clever for themselves and go well outside of the established routines of how to solve them. While in some cases this worked well, there are quite a few that gave you no starting reference point of how to even begin to solve them. This can lead to quite a bit of frustration and then gets compounded with the occasional bug that pretty much leads to a roll back save to try a different approach just to avoid the bug.   Endings. Big fan of anime here so I understand the idea of endings that aren't exactly clean but damn... the one that takes care of the most things literally nullifies the entire purpose of the game.

I can safely say that this is one of the best RPG games you will ever find, it's one of those games that will earn the definition of classic cRPG decades later. Normally I don't play a lot of turn-based tactical RPGs in my lifetime because I find the genre not my biggest interest but this game did a fantastic job enticing me into its universe.   Q: How does the game run? Any bugs or crashes or technical issues? A: In 30 hours of playing I have encounter maybe 1 or 2 bugs but I find them minor, for example, some quests did not classify as finished when I just got the reward for it. I have not experienced a single crash in any of my games and did not run to any framerate issues.  Q: Do you recommend it or not? A: Absolutely recommend it! The game is very well-made, the developers really poured their heart and soul into this game and it shows. It has online & local splitscreen coop, PvP, Tactical combat, controller support, mods, great writing, so much paths and methods to tackle any quest, Game Master Mode, and much more. I can tell the Larian Studios had a blast making this and it's thanks to them and the kickstarters backers that help fund this fantastic game.  Overall score: 10/10 Pros:  +Fun and challenging tactical combat  +Easy to get into but hard to master +Interesting and unique characters with the companions having their own origin stories. +Mod Support +A well-implemented coop feature that doesn't feel tacked on. +Beautiful Soundtrack +Definitely more than 100 hours of content. +Very well polished with little to no bugs or crashes and haven't experienced any framerate issues so far. +Game Master Mode which is a DnD style game which is a interesting way to play the game with friends. +Multiple ways to tackle an objective. +You have a ton of freedom and choice. +The graphics look great with some pretty locations. +So much secrets and this game encourages to carefully look and explore its world.  Neutral: =The voice acting for the most part is good but some are odd and feels inconsistent when it comes to the audio quality but it does its job. =The quest journal I find to be a clunky with the map. When you have multiple quests active, you have multiple markers on the map that just seems messy and confusing. Although it is not hard to figure out what you are suppose to be doing. =A few quality-of-life changes would have been nice like increasing the walking speed outside of combat or having the hotbar not be cluttered whenever you pick up an item like a grenade. Luckily these two problems can be fixed with a mod.  Cons: -Honestly there is zero cons I can think of for this game, other than on higher difficulties the enemies like to use a lot of cheese tactics which can be frustrating to deal with but you can use those same tactics on them too.  I'll definitely play this game much more and I have still a lot more content to explore and be playing them with my friends whenever I get the chance. I highly recommend you get this game, I gave it a 10/10 rating not as a ""This game is perfect in every way,"" the game has a few issues, but it's more of a ""This game is worth every penny of your purchase"" kind of rating. Pick this game up for yourself or with 3 other friends, you will not regret it! "

Ramdhanu,265,13,0,January 14,Recommended,173.9,"Divinity Original Sin 2.  While Original Sin was already a good RPG game and had plenty to offer, I was a bit skeptical that whether or  not Larian Studios could top that. But boy did they. Original Sin 2 is better than the first in every way. It‚Äôs safe to say that Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of the best, if not the best RPG of year,especially for us old school pen & paper rpg lovers.  While RPG's are all about choices & consequences & development of your character,you don't find many PC RPG's that offer this kind of choices,where your decisions and actions are so impactful. Meaning, You can kill an NPC related to the main quest,try to steal from a vendor & loose access to their inventory,build your dream character or a good for nothing crew,the choices are limitless . There is always another way to take care of your duties if you fail in one. In other worlds, Larian was able to  PUT THE R BACK IN RPG in this game.  Another really strong aspect of Divinity Original Sin 2 is its characters,especially the SIX Origin Characters to choose from who have rich backstories and amazing voice-acting to boot. Similar to Dragon Age Origins,the Origins lets you play as unique characters with their own agendas & goals. And if you want to create a custom character,then fret not,you can have them as companions in your journey. One piece of advice though. There's a nasty piece of surprise waiting for you at the end of ACT 1. So choose & build your companions carefully.  As far as gameplay is concerned, there‚Äôs nothing new or innovative in terms of gameplay, but rather, a refined version of what we‚Äôve already had for years. The only thing complicated is stuff like crafting or spell combinations and such. But once you have a general idea of how they work, you‚Äôll be breezing through them.  The game also  comes with an amazing soundtrack, very fitting for whatever situation you‚Äôre in. Additionally, the VFX sounds, be it for blood spatter or whatever fancy spell you‚Äôre flinging, and the sounds that the weird creatures and characters you come across make, it all fits right in place. Not to mention,the entire game is voice acted & makes the experience all the more enjoyable, especially for those experiencing the genre for the first time.  Similarly, no complaints with the visuals. While it‚Äôs not an extremely graphic intensive by today‚Äôs standards, but still it delivers a very visually appealing experience. The environments look great and the details in the surroundings, be it inside a ship, or a cabin, or out in the open (anywhere really), is amazing.  Overall, one will have a hard time finding another RPG like this one around. Divinity does a lot of things right and I have to hand it to Larian Studios for creating an RPG masterpiece here. The plethora of options that actually matter, the rich characters, the story itself, this game has a lot going for it. You won't & cannot go wrong with buying this game,whether on full price or on a deal.  My Verdict 9.5/10.  PS : Fund Divinity Original Sin 3 if they are going to create it in the future. What Larian has shown us so far, it is well worth to pay them the full price & something extra for their efforts."

ArenMook,174,16,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,390.6,"If you've enjoyed the first Divinity: Original Sin, you owe it to yourself to pick up this one. Larian took everything that was great about the first game and made it even better.  Word of warning though, it's easier to screw up in DOS2 than it is in DOS1. Literally a minute into the game you can either recruit or kill your first companion, simply depending on how you talk to them.  Stealing mechanics changed from DOS1 -- both guards and whoever owns the item will actively seek out the thief (you), and should they find you red-handed, throw you in prison, attack or simply take the stolen merchandise, again depending on how you talk your way out of the situation. Fortunately even if you choose the violent option, the game is still perfectly playable. Merchants and civilians don't participate in the fight.  I'd write more, but I think I'll just go ahead and play some more instead."
Kad,9,29,0,August 30,Recommended,66.4,"Originally I wasn't going to review this game on this account because I have few hours on this account. However, reading through some of the reviews out there, I wanted to speak my piece.  This game changes things from the previous game in the series. And some argue that it makes the game harder, forcing you to play as a certain type of character. However, I feel the need to point out that you are only forced into playing a certain way if you desire to be the absolute best possible character in the game. People say that mixed damage parties are not viable because of the armor system in the game. (If you are unaware, every character in the game has an amount of Physical Armor and Magical Armor. These armors prevent damage and certain effects until they are depleted.) However, me and a friend did a playthrough of this game, and we played as a mixed damage party. For those who are interested, we had: a Summoner who also had abilities in Aerothurge, Pyrokinetic and Geomancer. That was my main. a Ranger who focused on long range physical damage, but also dabbled in Pyrokinetic. That was my secondary character. a Rogue who focused almost entirely on Physical damage. That was my friend's main. a Cleric who used Hydrosophist and Warfare, and acted as our team's tank. That was my friends secondary character. The point of that is to show that we had a diverse build to our team. Sure, it may not have been the most effective. But do you know what it was? Fun. We had a lot of fun playing that party. So, before you get this game, ask yourself this. Do I want to be able to create a character who is unique to my playstyle, even if they are not necessarily the best? If you say yes, then you will enjoy this game. There are so many options for what you can do. However, if you want to build the best possible character, then unfortunately, you will likely be disappointed with how you will need to build a certain way. However, is that not what something being the best mean? If one object is better than all other objects of the same type, does that not mean that in that catagory, there is no other choice besides that one object? It is the same for looking at the builds in Divinity: Original Sin 2. Yes, one is better than all the other. However, if you only play to have the best build, then I think you are missing the entire point of the game. This game is meant to be a medium for telling a story, for sharing memories. While you can play the game alone, it is my belief that for the true experience of the game, you should play it with friends. And when you do, feel free to play however you desire. I will lead to some good laughs when you look back at it."
Aisukurimu,24,12,0,May 30,Recommended,595.9,"In short, this is a game of high replayability with an immensely immersive world.    Quests Quests are in one way or another, interrelated to each other, they are not shallow ""fetch quests"" and each one actually reflects a little bit about the world of Rivellon. Players are not required to complete quests in any certain ways as each path you take is considered progression towards the ultimate goal. There are also  multiple ways to approach a single quest, whether it is to be a righteous individual and not ask for reward; to be a villain who only cares for your own self interest; or having to choose between two evils knowing either choice will have undesirable sacrifices. You could encourage a man to not dwell on pursuing vengeance and be merciful, perhaps that man will not stray from his righteous path, but he might  lose something/someone else .    Gameplay In terms of gameplay, I was initially not a fan of turn-based combat, which is largely what this game is about. I was more accustomed to ARPG-like combat as seen in Diablo 3. However, I allow myself to give this game a try despite my dislike of turn-based combat. It was a good decision as I later found myself so engaged by the turn-based combat in this game. Combat in this game has  great depth due to abilities being able to interact with the game environment, like creating chain explosions by casting fire on a poison/oil surface; or electrocuting an enemy and stunning him because you've already pre-casted a water surface beneath him. What's more amazing is that the  combat AI also make use of these mechanics! The combat has great potential for a highly strategic approach and it is very satisfying to see your strategies in effect. After multiple playthroughs, I realised that there are so many possible approaches to a single fight, and sometimes one mistake is all it takes to bring the player down from an advantageous position that could ultimately mean deaths of characters or even defeat of the whole party (The combat AI is no joke on higher difficulties, really smart and makes really calculated moves, which made the game more fun for me).    General experience In terms of the general RPG experience, personally I think the game has a  good amount of both combat and dialogues/stories. Dialogues are fully voiced and occasionally amusing. NPCs' responses in dialogue actually depend on players' races. There are also ""tags"" which can be selected when creating a custom character, these  tags allow you to do certain things that other tags cannot. For example, a character with a Scholar tag can interpret ancient tomes and gain knowledge from it; whereas a character with a Mystic tag is able to use their own sheer will to repel evil presence possessing innocent people to attack travellers. There are also ""Origin"" characters, which are essentially characters that already have their own backgrounds in the world of Rivellon and by playing as them/recruiting them as companions, you gain access to their own quests that might sometimes  intertwine with other Origin characters' quests.    Conclusion These are my personal views on what makes this game great for me. There are more exciting features that this game has which I don't think a single review can contain. If you like RPG games that leaves you an empty space after completing it, this is one such game. And the price tag is definitely modest for a game this big."

Nether,23,28,0,"August 7, 2017",Recommended,215.5,"Im super excited for the release date, if you're into Dragon Age or RPGs with turn-based combat, Id /strongly/ recommend it.   This is the first of the DOS games I tried, but after trying the alpha, which Ive spent 30 hours in (of the ""suggested"" 8-12 hours), I went back and played the D:OS 1, I was genuinely surprised to see it was a decent game, but also realizing that it actually is lightyears behind this one, D:OS 2.   It doesnt have the live combat, which DA has, but its turn based where the attack time is based on your characters' strengths and weakness' (for lack of better simplistic explanation) - Id personally take the real time action over this one, but it still seems to be well-made.   I think its a bit deceiving with the main character's customization, as the characters you find throughout the game can matter just as much, if not more. Only benefit is a bit of options to change the look. Additionally, I think its a shame you can swap the discovered characters in between different ""conflicting speccs"" as you find them, as in, mage OR warrior and not just pick between whether you want the warrior to be in a defensive or aggressive build - it ruins a bit of the RP feel of the characters in my mind. You could have the option to swap between the conflicting paths, but then you should get a RP story explaining why that it is a possibility, and only have it as a rare trait to some of them. If you're playing on high difficulty, having this would mean you directly need to find a healer/tank/rogue to unlock certain skills/benefits.   Im lacking a bit of character story and overall story, which you can find in the early Dragon Age games, but it hardly affects my belief of the game. Im excited to see how the late game develops, as Im afraid you get overpowered a bit too soon, in addition to the fact that the cookie cutter builds seem to be a bit too either overpowered, or obvious.   One thing I actually spite, is the fact that the amount of discovered/hidden ""legendary"" weapons are slightly too many, and of too high importance. If you're playing on max difficulty, you're almost forced to google to find them, in order to being able to beat the NPC/AI. Atleast this is the case if youre in the range of my skill-level, which admittedly isn't perfect.   Everything I could think of on the spot, September cant come soon enough."

You can explore, craft, talk to people like a regular rpg but the combat system is purely strategic.

The range of skills and builds you can manage is huge and there is so much to explore that if you like the genre you will have lots of playthroughts and several hours of fun. 11/10  "

Like Gandalf after the Balrog fight, I lay like roadkill on Gaming‚Äôs Last Stand. Left in the ditch by the ravenous, greedy games industry, all but forcing me to violently amputate myself from my hobby after so many years, my thoughts returned to me through the mist of my mind. Game publishers had made me hate gaming more and more with every Microtransaction, Gambling Lootbox, and √ºbergreedy DLC-pettiness, rubbing their scummy hands together, waiting for their chance to turn me so desperate that I'd sell my mum's wheelchair just to be able to play the story of a single player game wholesale instead of in disgusting piece-meal chunks.  Exhausted. Ready to let my hobby die.  Clearing my head to drift forever into the mindless, mainstream, middle-aged hobbies of pathetic Rom-Coms so bad they have to tell you where to laugh, sports night with a team letting you down for 20 years straight, and pedantic tv-gameshow hosts as full of themselves as the CEOs and board members of todays‚Äô AAA game companies.  I had cried out for Mr. Newell, but he was nowhere to be seen. I called out for him again and again, desperately trying to summon the one time so great mythical Valve Overlord to give me a glimpse of Half-Life 3 or some other new IP, for a last incongruent attempt to restore my faith in The Greatest Hobby ever known. But Mr. Newell had sojourned to the evil gates of DOTA 2 many moons ago, and had never been seen since. Every Valve knave had followed their once and future king, but in their wake had only left silence for those few of us who still cared. Their footprints, all leading to DOTA 2, and not one leading back, had all but vanished.  And amidst the Consumer Forest behind Valve Village, there was talk of another presence, only whispered in fear, between creeping darkness and depressive thoughts; Artifact... Artifact... The wind carried the promise of a terrible omen, of yet another unnecessary card game to come, assuring the deliverance of the final strike into the once golden, now charred, heart of gaming. And Mr. Newell never appeared in this, my darkest hour. The heroic saviour was lost to time and space as he had succumbed to The Void of Game Industry Indifference.  My mind wandered. Valve Village lay in ruins. Long was the time since anyone had fixed anything on the barricades of Team Fortress, and the walls of Counter-Life: Grognard Operations' padded cells had crumbled, leaving demons and hell-outcasts running rampant and harassing any remaining villagers. There were rumors that some of the worst of these creatures had even snuck after Gabe through the gates of DOTA, in the Unholiest of Unholy joinings of good and evil, but none had heard back from them either. The Portals to the temple of Half-Life were rusted to a sad metal heap, and the temple they guarded had lied dormant for centuries with no Programmer Priests or Artist Acolytes left to work on the Half-Life religion. Valve Village was a ghost town. Dying at last, together with me.  I felt my body getting numb. I knew I was close to exhaling my last breath of gaming. Doomed to never experience the warm freedom from pathetic corporate game publisher mind tricks. Never allowed again to experience the sheer joy of a great game not tormented by CEO and board member greed.  I closed my eyes.  I made my peace with everything. Accepting of Bobby Kotick‚Äôs miniscule loaf-member, mercilessly drilling down the insides of my throat and demolishing my gag reflex for all time. No more protesting Zenimax‚Äô and Bethesda‚Äôs Pete Hines lying and lying, his nose getting longer and longer inbetween my butt cheeks as he denounced the fact that their new paid mods system is indeed paid mods. I let out a poor sigh as I came to terms with EA‚Äôs horror show, drowning me and their other customers in blank-white secrete of filthy business decisions, in amounts so vast they could shave their chiseled, unethical game publisher jawline in the mirroring reflection of my soaked forehead.  Nothing mattered anymore. We, the customers, had lost. And as a single tear ran down my cheek, gaming was dead and gone forever. I embraced the darkness and muttered a final prayer to the gaming gods of old, before feeling a last remaining speckle of life vanish from my veins. My gamer soul was ready. I was to return home to 8bit, 16bit, Playstation and PC; to the 80s and 90s gaming heaven. Far away from the grotesque demonic onslaught hell here, far from the karmic injustice of game publishers burning the industry down until they had extinguished its last pittance of grace. I was ready. And darkness came.  Then, movement.  Not from me. Outside of me.  A feather of light touched my eyes. A vague, finely tuned iota beam, shimmering onto my eyelids. It tormented my weak sight, but it was real! A light, a light! My body jolted as it shone towards me from the distant skies. My butt-crack ravaged, my throat sore, my forehead glistening with horrible, sticky Microtransaction DLC. I was not dead yet, there was a game title coming closer, flapping it's angel wings as it descended upon my old, withered gamer soul. And I could see the shape and the coming of Divinity: Original Sin 2 as the air around me became warmer and I felt life returning to me.  Larian had come to my rescue. They would not let me fall to the demonic creature game publisher overlords. They would conquer this Normandy, they would sail this Pacific. They would go on until the end. And no micro DLC could stand in their way of delivering the atomic bomb which destiny would have in itself the strenght and honour to become 2017s GOTY.  Long live Larian, the New Gamer Wine.

Going full initiative makes sure you always get to play first. You can kill all enemies before they have a first turn (on highest difficulty!)  - Obvious huge gaps in item upgrades  - Pickpocketing still way too broken (unlimited gold/all shopitems for free)  - Having 1% magic armor is enough to stop all debuffs  - Enemies too easy to crowd control (stun / freeze / knock down spam)  - Rangers STILL do too much damage (very broken in first game)  - No penalty for poor intelligence / low magic skill. Your spells will always land and you will always have 100% chance to crowd control. You can have a warrior/rogue/ranger hybrid mage. Having a pure mage is such a waste.  - Whole game revolves around the ""teleport"" spell or simular transportation abilities  - TOO many abilities that allow you to escape or move enemies. You can never get hit by melee enemies, and you can always teleport enemy ranger/mage infront of your melee team and just insta-kill them on highest difficulty.  - Almost all of the quests are broken. If you don't do them in the correct order (which means you can't explore anything) you can never complete them. Even the final quest of Act 1  - When you start a fight, your characters run around and position them selves very awkwardly. Even if you pre-set them in high ground etc they will run down and just stand somewhere totally unconvenient  - Sometimes the conversations always end in the same way, no matter what you choose to say. For example; you argue with an NPC. The outcome is exactly the same no matter if you win or lose the argument  - Argument stats (intimidate, wits, intelligence etc) don't matter. If you have maxed out your strenght you will still lose intimidation checks vs. cowards, if that's what the game-designers intended.  CONCLUSION! ‚Ä¢ All non-direct damage spells need to be nerfed alot.   ‚Ä¢ Debuff vs. magic armor system needs to be reworked.  ‚Ä¢ Conversations need to matter (it's an RPG for crying out loud..)  ‚Ä¢ Exploring shouldn't be punished by breaking quests.  ‚Ä¢ Crafting is totally pointless and needs to be reworked.  ‚Ä¢ Pickpockets needs a huge nerf.. since the starting area I have had the best items available to me.    There are alot of things that need improving and changing, obviously it being in EARLY ACCESS. I still recommend the game because I really enjoyed the first one and I know/hope they won't polish this one any less.  Hoping they put alot of effort into balancing things out so I don't feel like a God at level 2 (on highest difficulty);   I will probably rate the game 8/10 when complete (and nerfed)."

Aporis,124,96,16,"October 11, 2017",Recommended,88.0,"TL;DR. A damn crab on the beach is more deeper character than any NPC in Skyrim or Fallout 4 ever. Gameplay is so much more enjoyable and deeper than for example the Witcher series. Characters are relatable and funny like in Mass Effect games! Makes me so salty to think about it that they stuffed all this to one single indie title...  PROS: After finishing my 14 hour tutorial (EDIT: NVM I'm STILL IN THE TUTORIAL) I can already say this game does everything right and I ducking love it! This is the game that made me belive in the game industry again. I didn't like turn based combat, until now. I didn't like isometric point of view, until now. I didn't care too much about ingame conversations, until now. An RPG game you can play with FRIENDS and even cause drama in the scale of Mario Kart! Dialogue is far from monotonic and doesn't take itself too seriously. Voice acting is excellent to the point I found myself stopping to listen to the dialogue even tho I had finished reading it a while ago. I haven't had this rewarding and brain stimulating singleplayer experience for as long as I can remember. I haven't enjoyed this deep, different and open ways of approach to different situations ever in a videogame before.  If you're being like me and see all the reviews and think ""Should I buy this? What if I don't like it? It's so expensive"" JUST BUY IT IN THE NAME OF SOURCE! You won't regret it meow.  CONS: -Can't play accordion. -Steals your life."

GaloreDruid,54,10,1,April 5,Recommended,223.9,"I have not finished this game yet, currently I am approaching the end of act 2. That certainly goes to show something about the amount of content in this game, considering how many hours I've already played this game for. So far, I have a good grasp on what this game is like, so I'll give you a list of the good and bad.  Pros: Lots of content You have the option to do what quests you want to Quests have multiple ways of doing them Insane freedom is given in this game which I think RPGs tend to be lacking in (for story choices) Difficult fights that give a sense of achievement Variety of fights (no 2 fights are the same) The story Dialogue is all voice acted. Voice lines sound like there was a lot of thought put into each one. Dialogue for animals when you have pet pal This game achieves having a serious tone while having humor at the same time Descriptions for items are hilarious (ex. dismembered foot, ""All five toes, check! An attacked leg, Uhhhh..."" or when you click on a globe the narrator says, ""And you thought Rivellon was flat"") Insignificant NPCs still have voice lines, which really improves the immersion into the game You can steal whatever you want and kill whoever you want, however, there is an attitude system that punishes you for that Origin Characters in the game have interesting back stories The game allows you to have a romance with all the origin characters, including a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing skeleton, no more needs to be said. There are no traditional classes you are stuck to. You can mix and match whatever spells you want. For example, you could try going double shields with no weapon, and the spell ""shield throw."" I don't know why you would want to do it, but its possible The game is begging to be replayed with all the different builds on characters, origin character stories, and the ridiculous amount of choices you can make. The game has a tag system where your character earns tags through their actions, which gives you more dialogue options, and determines how npcs react to you. Elemental surfaces in combat are a very fun mechanic to work with. Races you pick in this game (Dwarf, Elf, Lizard, Human, and all the undead versions) all have unique abilities and tags unique to the races.  Cons: You can be thrown into a fight you don't expect (which can be also a pro depending on how you see it) Sometimes areas are high level to discourage you from going into them yet. This can get confusing when you don't know that there is another area with lower level enemies. You will use google at some point during this game. Some puzzles/ quests can be very difficult to figure out how to complete. Quicksave often, sometimes you might accidentally steal an item you didn't mean to if you click the wrong thing when moving. Devs, please just remove taunt entirely or change it. It's only one fight in the entire game so far that I've had to deal with this, but watching my character taken over by ai for a turn or two and using every scroll and source ability in my inventory is not an enjoyable game mechanic. Especially since it now pierces armor.  Overall, this is a great game that I would encourage you to give a try. It has some negatives, but they are definitely worth dealing with for the insane amount of positives the game has. The game has really good devs who seem to want to deliver a quality product, which they have. Out of all the RPGs I've tried, this is the best in my opinion."

A con though is that the difficulties isnt mere: More/Less HP or dmg, but the enemies changing their whole attack pattern. F.e. In tactician(hard) mode we hade a fight where they bursted our group in the first round with tons of elemental combos, when in Classic(normal) mode the same enemy encounter on the same level didnt use any element even once in the whole fight.  Feeling whise its going from 'Naked in a Snowstorm' to 'Idle on a Caribbean Beach'. Thats only from Hard to Normal, cant imagine the Very Hard mode.  I assume that even on Classic mode it gets a bit harder as the game continues, concidering my review takes place in the starting area.   Besides that: I really enjoy the game and think its a must buy for every RPG / Penpaper player"

Kaaros Aleri,331,13,4,"March 29, 2017",Recommended,189.3,"Short Version: The game is fudgin awsome, and in my opinion lives up to the Original Sin (hehe), Dialogue is better, Combat is slightly different but still just as fun, though the attributes still needs work and ballancing, the drop in multiplayer sucks massive Cysealean Fish gonads because of the almost non-existant host controls and no in-game voice chat that i could find, though in organized play can probably be the most awesome experience in the game because of the awesome saves that can happen with you and your friends. I rate the game a 9/10 with the multiplayer a 5/10.  This review will be mainly on singleplayer gameplay, of which i have player over 24 hours during the writing of this review and i will try not to spoil or touch the main story, quests and puzzles.           Gameplay 8.7/10                     The gameplay, much like it's predescessor, is a turn based RPG a la classic fallout and in my experience is much faster paced than fallout and Divinity: Original sin. The difference in gameplay from Divinity: Original sin is that the action system is more compact, some attributes were replaced to make things more simpler, defence from physical and magical attacks as secondary ""health"" bars instead of %reduced, a character past system that gives you new dialogue, and that the dreaded rock paper scissor persuasion system is gone. Many sees the changes as a double edges sword as it removes the more familiar aspects of the game, but to me it was very easy to learn which may have been the intent of the studio and you can take this as a negative or a positive.      Dialogue and persuasion system   10/10   Better than previous system in my opinion  The player dialogue changes i very much appreciated, especially the removed rock paper scissor system, the character past dialogue is interesting and suprisingly incredibly useful as you can get minor help from NPCs, an example would be ""MINOR SPOILER""  in the cave there is a lizard who sells physical weapons, armor, and spellbooks that will give you a minor discount for having the soldier tag  .      Combat Gameplay   9/10   It's different though not much better than the previous system in my opinion.  The gameplay and combat is still quite similar to it's predescessor, but much more fast paced and flashy, especially the new source magic though some of it can be underwhelming. Many of the combat changes seems to be based around the new magic and physical armor system, particularly the damage dealt within one round of combat seems to have been bumped up by a lot both NPC and playable characters compared to the older system.  The difficulty around the armor system can sometimes be glaring because magic, to me, is a much greater threat than physical attacks because of the almost ridiculous amounts of dangerous magical effects that enemies utilize like  poison, stun, fire, frozen, and curse  compared to the physical debilitations,  cripple, knockdown and in rare cases bleed  being the most dangerous physical ones. The good thing about the new system is that as long as you have the type of armor the effect/element affects the debilitation will only be applied when that armor bar is fully depleted, though some can see this as a negative since i actually liked the willpower/bodybuilding system.  Physical combat is still a very good way to do focused damage on one particular enemy, but is more devastating on one with little to no physical armor as  a well placed  barrage of arrows and melee hits can dispatch those enemies very quickly, though the same can't be said for monsters fighting against the playable characters unless the players are underleveled, but a proper and well built team can still kill enemies 3 levels higher than them.      Attribute changes   7/10   Simplifying things doesn't mean better, this is a good example. Worse than the previous system but is still okay in my opinion. The attribute changes to me are weird, like dr seuss weird, wits being too good with it affecting initiative and perception, constitution does not affect anything other than health, memory not affecting anything other than amount of spells (in my opinion it should affect some dialogue or something out of combat), and intelligence, having the same problem with memory only affecting combat and spells with no change in dialogue or out of combat stuff, strength is still heavily affecting combat very useful for throwing and lifting stuff and other out of combat stuff but is still overtaken by telekenessis, finesse only seems to affect combat and theivery, all in all the attribute changes are pretty wonky compared to the previous game.     Multiplayer   Drop in 3.1/10  oh boy.    Organized 10/10  I've not played organized multiplayer but i can see it being incredibly fun. I've only played multiplayer once and it was drop in multiplayer, and first impressions are the most important especially for new players. There are very little controls for the host of the game, for a game based heavily based on teamwork and tactics there is no voice chat from what i can find, the kick function does not work properly because a player can just rejoin particularly trolls and greifers. A help bar and proper command console/tab for hosts can help tremendously, adding a function that ban players from the server, and an option for local voice chat can help drop in play by a lot.  "

Marius,161,10,0,August 3,Recommended,270.2,"This game was amazing. The complex combat kept pulling me back to it. The story was immersive. I am writing this review to warn you about the end. The game is amazing until you get to the end. The game all of a sudden wants to throw weird puzzle mechanics that just don't fit with the flow of the game. They are also really annoying. Some boss fights don't follow the combat mechanics but yet your party does. The bosses do like 10 things at once and get back all of their AP (action points) on their next turn. If you played it on lone wolf, then you are able to do it too, but reccommended for advance players. My last warning before you buy this beautiful game is that the game still has bugs in it. There are many quest that can glitch out resulting in you not getting the xp or the award for completing the quest. There is a large list of them and you can google them when the time comes. I only had the one quest bug on me when i played through the game. Others had at least 10 + quest bug out for them. Worth it to the very end."

Brian (The Schmaltzy Cynic),893,16,10,"October 19, 2017",Recommended,179.3,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is the making of legends in modern games: A fully-voiced acted, superbly written 40-50 hour journey, tailored for both single-player or four-player local/online cooperation, with as much reasons for replayability to shape the narrative and to bite further into its sense of challenge as the amount of genuine affection and RPG craftmanship made into this one game. When you feature dynamic instrument options for battle music in a character creator and even after a hundred hours you still have more to learn and to explore in the world, you know you have stumbled across a game unlike no other.   This is also ignoring the extra features made for the community to expand the life of DOS2 with a Pen & Paper style mode, Game Master, and a dev-kit of modding tools to create your own adventures that harkens back to the glory days of Neverwinter Nights. There is simply too much care crafted into the soul of this game that it is simply impossible not to fall in love with it, even if the gameplay can pull some cheap punches for challenge leftover from the previous title. At its worst, DOS2 can be so mired by its hurdles that it makes the pursuit even more tempting to overcome. Unlike the original, this diamond in the rough illuminates all traces of imperfection the more you become lost in its brilliance.  It‚Äôs Not What You Say That Counts; It‚Äôs What You Do Before I begin to address the issues, the writing techniques of DOS2 need to be given their praise. Unlike the original which made itself into a buddy comedy experience to a fault for its abundance of comedy and non-cooperative dialogue, DOS2 keeps some of the buddy chatter for only multiplayer and the game focuses more on second-person dialogue to create the amount of choices and role-playing opportunities. Instead of creating lines for every character in every scenario, the dialogue creates the illusion of what you want to say and how you say it by smartly giving you options written as commands.   If you are not sure what I mean, then think of the situation this way: The writers can write as much options as they need to convey all available options without having to take into consideration of the character‚Äôs tone. Instead of writing out a angered, elated, depressed, etc. response, the narrator only has to give you options like a choose-your-own adventure book. (Ex. *Assume you know what he is blabbering on about.*) This method adds far more role-playing options without breaking immersion of your character, and it adds far more vivid choices that can affect the moment.  Even if you prefer a character with all voice-acted lines, DOS2 also offers Origin characters which are the companions of the game that you can play with their own backstories and voice-actors. You still can make choices but the character is more grounded than custom ones, and unlike the original the companions or players you tag along with have a greater sense of companionship because of this dialogue system and the story being focused on deciding whether to stick together or to divide amongst yourselves. This is a beautiful system that caters to all preferences in RPGs that does not weaken the storytelling nor the role-playing of the game, and it‚Äôs a system I hope more RPGs include this method to save money on voice-acting every single line.     Call Me Unreliable‚Ä¶ Well, I‚Äôm None Too Clever; I Just Adore You Now let‚Äôs discuss the biggest issue with DOS2 that stems from the original, the seemingly unpredictable difficulty until you learn the game from the inside out. After nearing 200 hours, starting from Explorer and reaching the modded Infernal Difficulty, my experience has become a well-rounded experience, and this statement is still true. This is why I think it‚Äôs important to revisit this section to delve into the discussion once more.  Compared to the first game, DOS2 has a more creative approach to difficulty than rigid standards of what it defines as challenge. It is by no means an easier game than the first as Fort Joy is the first major obstacle to overcome due to resource scarcity and the importance of synergy with your builds; however, there are modifiers to enhance the challenge to suit the player. These things include making undead characters who can only heal by poison, which isn‚Äôt as much of a problem as it sounds as you can make interesting undead teams, straying from traditional party set-ups like having no main healer, or by adding more/less characters to the experience. (The ironic twist is that a two-man Lone Wolf party is MORE capable than a seven-man team on the same difficulty.) All of these modifiers are creative means for players to create a game as difficult as they want and still retain its sense of balance.  This balance is largely the result of all the new changes to combat. For starters, the armor system is completely reworked into physical and magic armor, which helps divide enemies by targeting their weaker armor. This also prevents stun-lock skills like battering ram to be abused without removing all the physical armor. As a result, it‚Äôs more important to make every party member have decent equipment and weapons‚Äîwhich in a strange way makes adding more companions more difficult with less good armor to go around‚Äîas enemies often will use area-of-effect attacks to weaken your party.   Second, the environment has more usefulness in combat. One simple change is the addition of elevation scaling that can add/lower damage based on who has the higher ground. Archers gain stupidly insane damage scaling as a result of this feature which makes them the most worthwhile member on the team. Elemental effects remain as potent, but the magic armor helps negate their damage spiraling out of control. UI problems like line of sight are no longer an issue as hitboxes have proper sizes as I never made one mistake in my decisions. However, certain elements like curse are often annoying because if you cast Bless on a pit of fire to remove them it should heal your party, but it will damage them instead; you have to cast it again, a limited resource, to make it heal them.  As a result of these features, the inventiveness and fluidity of combat never becomes stale, which only rewards players more incentive to play around with its systems and its immersive storytelling features that the Infinity Engine games always aspired to be. Whenever I think I have discovered everything, even 150 hours into the game, I manage to discover something new. This beauty itself is forever stuck in my mind after deciding to restart the game again because I wondered if two undead can romance‚Äîif a game can tantalize you back with a simple, ‚ÄúWhat if‚Ä¶?,"" then this game is truly something special.   An Ocean of Content with 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea Aside from those issues, the game is phenomenal any way you look at it as an RPG. The role-playing itself sets new boundaries and standards for all RPGs, single-player or cooperative. The sense of freedom and cooperation is leagues better than it was previously. Even the story itself handles its comedic elements far better with its grit that the darker moments are never too far away from a chuckle to lighten the mood. Lastly, modders will be able to take all the lessons learned from its community and Larian Studios themselves to create a thriving landscape of future potential for this game and the future of Divinity.  Whether or not you are familiar with the Divinity series, DOS2 is great on its own merits. However, a lot of meaning will be lost if you do not know the series‚Äô history as it takes place 1,000 years after the original (four years after Beyond Divinity.) This is not a criticism but something praiseworthy that describes DOS2 as a whole; it‚Äôs a game with 20,000 leagues of depth beneath the sea and an ocean of content that spans across the horizon. This is a journey that will make you crave more adventure."
Whyzard,576,13,1,"October 25, 2016",Recommended,69.0,"I played this game for only 15 hours, however, I would gladly replay the campaign with friends, or fight them in the Arena mode. Only the first Act is out for now, and despite that, even if I did not even do every available quest, I spent 15 hours on this game. That part of the campaign also happens to have good replayability, because every quest can be finished in a diverse number of ways. The gameplay, while lacking some polish and balance (not too long ago some skills were seriously overpowered), is impressive and looks like it's only going to get better. The story and the characters are well written, and endearing. The game managed to make me care about characters that I only met in one quest, which is indicative of its overall quality. In conclusion, despite the current version of the game being short, it is brilliant and shows a lot of promise. I applaud the people at Larian for their work, and I trust them to make this the awesome game I know it can be. Of course, you should only buy it in its current state if you want to support the developpers, as, in its current state, it is not worth 45‚Ç¨ I will update my review as soon as that changes, however.  EDIT: Well, the game is out now, and boy, I wasn't disappointed. The two new playable characters, Fane and Beast, are every bit as interesting as the other ones, and bring their own little story line too.  Many skills were added while others were re-balanced, mod support is here, and it seems that it can do absolutely amazing stuff, Game-Master Mode is pretty intuitive and easy to handle with a bit of practice, and combined with mod support, I think it's going to allow for a wide range of adventures and campaigns to be designed by aspiring GMs. Overall, while the UI can be clunky at times, it is well designed. I'm especially impressed by how Larian pulled off the controller controls and UI, it requires a bit of getting used to, but it works great. Local Coop is great too, and it means that you can more easily play with friends that could not necesaarily have bought the game. Overall, a fantastic game, that I recommend without hesitation."

PROS +game design- if you think through all situations and are willing to die a few times trying there are many different ways to complete any situation. +graphics- my pc is not grand(base alianware alpha I3 until i pay my house down and build my new pc this winter) and i run this game at 1440p high graphics and around 30 fps( never dipping below) +choice-i truely feel like i have a say at some parts of this game( hence i said someparts, this is very clsoe to a pen and paper but does fall short as will all games every played with any type of AI, it is just in the nature.) +difficulty- i know this has been a hot subject since alot of people are finding the game a little to difficult but it is my own opinion, i play on tactition mode, have 1.) undead poly, ranger. 2.)normal summoner lohse. 3.) normal rouge sibille. 4.) normal geo, warfare beast.  and i find the enocunters to be very difficult but i really enjoy a true challenge, as well as a challenge to know when i am out matched( does not happen often for most games now a days with all the monsters leveling with you. eg The Elder Scrolls Online, )i do enjoy that game too.)) +balance- while this is not a perfect positive i felt it worth noting. no game can be perfectly balenced but i feel as though my build setup(see note above) is far from perfect and yet i play on the hardest normal difficulty. and to me that is saying something, i did not feel like i had to play a certain way to enjoy the harder fights.  now for some of the bad i did notice.  -the number one thing i saw in this game that was missing... it is most likely something small to most but enemys and other npcs have things on their body that is not in their inventory. now i dont mind not having the armour and weapons, i would feel like i would be overwelmed with over powered things that would make me feel to powerfull( i dont enjoy that it gets boring, i like the fight just to stay in the fight.) but if i could use my rouge to sneak and replace a healing potion with a poison bottle, that would change the game for me. allow me to steal things( if i was tacticle about manuvering the land not to get caught.) that might hinder my teammates useless for fights. i just feel like that would be the cherry atop the already iced and sprinkled cake. -difficulty- i personally understand why alot of people dont like the way the game was made more (difficult) with it only being a stat buff to the enemys, and a rather drastic one at that, so i think there could be more difficulty modes, and take the one good thing from ark Survival evolved and add a slider for a custom difficulty( this is supposed to mimic a pen and paper like dnd give the players the choice.   there are more pros and cons to this game, but these were the ones i felt i would want to know about if i were trying to decide on buying this or not.  for me this game is a solid 10/10 there is room for improvment in any game but give credit where it is do. this game deserves it, it is rather a amazing title.  P.S. this is one of the maybe 4-7 games i have bought non-steamsale. i do not regret it at all and would very much recomend it to single player or multiplayer. thank you for reading this far and i hope this review helped you make a decision.( ask any questions you guys may have and i will do my best to answer!)  EDIT*  one more thing that I thought of that I personally feel should be fixed, as far as combat goes I don't mind the stat buff or the enemy having shorter cool down for skills then you do.  with that said the game should not allow an enemy to have free range of sight, what I mean is I have seen so many times that if I am in range but not within line of sight a enemy can hit you but not vice versa.  to me this is far from a game breaking bug. but it is the only way I feel gimped in any true way cause I cant truly have all power over placing my troops since ( in some cases) enemys could fire through that brush that I hid behind while shooting the other guy, with that said it also does not happen that often."

But I don't want to be tediously lengthy   because adding to the sea of praises for DOS2 is redundant. You search it up and you will find things everywhere like ""best pc game of 2017"", ""best RPG ever"", ""best game XXX've ever played"". They are all correct, and they have conviced many people to buy the game and share the amazing experience. But they haven't worked on you because you are still reading a nobody's review to decide whether this game is worth your money.   So I guess I have to write a bit more  You haven't played this game. Why? I get it. You saw some screenshots, watched some videos and probably you don't like some elements of the game. It's nothing like what you've played before, and you thought well it's not your type, doesn't suit your taste. I know, people are way too individualized. But, what defines your taste? Youtubers? Streamers? Friends? Game Studios? No. It's yours. A true gamer never stops exploring. Every once in a while you need to step out of your comfort zone and try something different. Yes, from what you've learned about this game, your prejudices are probably 100% accurate, but if you haven't tried it, please don't believe you won't like it.   If you've had the patience to read thus far, stir up a bit of courage and buy this game. Just sit back, empty your mind, and DOS2 will expand it, then blow it up into pieces.   If for some stupid reason you are still reluctant to try this game, it would be such a painful loss, a shame and a pity for both me and you. Because then apparently I have failed to convince you, and you would have missed the oppourtunity to enjoy hundreds of hours of divine entertainment that you could never obtain by other means.

My only problems for the first game were (1) character customization and (2) the lighthearted nature of the story.    Well, so far, Original Sin 2 has fixed those problems with a jackhammer.  I mean the customization isn't perfect, but it is leagues improved from the last game.  And the tags are awesome.  As for the nature of the story, it is much more grimdark.  Plus, with the tags, you can already tell there will be tons of replayability.    The game is beautiful.  And it's scary to know that this game is going to get so much better.  Heck, knowing this studio, we'll probably get an enhanced edition.    This isn't a full game and I don't usually recommend games in early access, but considering the source and based on how much fun I've had with this, I have to recommend. it."

Rhuzkii,243,29,2,"October 1, 2016",Recommended,394.9,"This game is incredible! I can't tell you though which game of the series is better, seeing that they are both AMAZING!  I just wanted to give some feedback on the things I personally think are too overpowered. So I played as a elf warrior, and your race ability as elf is that you get 1 AP and + 25% dmg for some constitution. Then as a warrior you have enrage, which gives you 100% crit, and you can choose a talent called ""War Lord"" which enables you to get 2 AP back when you execute an enemy. With Warrior having 3 charges (Blitz Attack, Battering Ram and Phoenix Dive) which only cost 1 AP and Crippling Blow and Whirlwind as AoE you can easily solo pretty much everything. Those things in combination with the golden double handed axe you can buy from an NPC not that far into Fort Joy's story line you are just way too powerful compared to everything else. I mean pretty much all I did with Lohse and Sebille was relocating enemies using Teleportation and then just utterly demolishing everyone with my warrior. Red Prince was basically only there for the extra cc, allthough I found out that stacking physical armour on him and giving him Bracus' Helm and letting him learn Overpower is incredibly powerful aswell, seeing that he can shatter enemies' physical armour in an instance, making them an easy target for chain ccing them. So that was the part about warrior being too powerful, now I wanted to move to the part where I REALLY like the idea of two different types of armour (physical and magical) and them protecting you from negative status effects, BUT on the other hand it's just way too easy to abuse this mechanic into chain ccing everything, making the fights not really challenging at all. So in the end I wanted to say: Don't get me wrong, I really REALLY like the game and I was soooo frustrated when I cleared the first act that I had to wait until the actual release of the game, but I personally found those things that I listed too powerfull."
Angeluse,177,12,3,"July 11, 2017",Recommended,219.6,"So don't get me wrong, this game is still in early access, as they say in the actual purchase description thing on the store page here. Just buy if you want to support them. That being said, this game is God Damn Good.  If you like RPG's/DnD all wrapped together with pretty decently done co op. Look no further, The amount of freedom this game gives you in both combat and actual interactions with characters is something i haven't encountered much of in a long time. Watch about 15 mins of gameplay online or something of the sort, and you'll see what i mean. The description said 8-12 hours for the Act 1 that this early access lets you play. Me and my friend are at 15 and have yet to even beat the act.  It's a must buy in my opinion."
Clockwork,311,12,1,"September 24, 2016",Recommended,465.8,"The depth of this game and the ridiculous amount of fun I had in every encounter allowed me to completely forget any odd glitches that come with an early access game. Though I could only play through one act, it took me almost a week to do so, with so many paths and so much to explore, and so many characters to create. I can only hope that Larian continues to flesh out this already rich experience and expand it. There's so much here, and so much potential. Improving upon everything I can think of from the first game, they've really done the RPG genre some justice.   I anxiously await the full release of the game, and I hope they continue to work on it well beyond."
BloodXIII,91,9,0,"April 4, 2017",Recommended,124.0,"Unbelievable. This game is amazing. I've been burned by alot of Early Access titles before but I'm really happy to say Divinty: Original Sin 2 blew me away.  In terms of gameplay the combat was just the right amount of difficult (classic difficulty) so that I had to really think about my actions and not just go on auto pilot and auto attack, but not too difficult that I had to read guides on how to beat a certain boss or encounter. The puzzles and quests were engaging enough that I didn't blow through them and forget about them, but not too complex or long that I was completing them simply for the sake of moving on.  There were a few bugs such as certain skills failing to registering but seeing as this is an Early Access game I'm not too worried (In 19 hours of gameplay skills only failed to land 3 times).   If you enjoy RPGs you'll love this game. I'm not a big fan of turnbased games, I simply get bored because I feel no connection to the characters in top down turnbased games, but, like Xcom: EW and XCom2, DoS2 seemed to make all my concerns about turn based games fade. I truly felt invested in the characters and felt like I was in the middle of the action, cheering when my glass cannon rogue pulls off an insanely reckless but satisfying attack. The game truly elicited some genuine reactions from me. I got upset when my mage stupidly pulled aggro and laughed when a massively armored knight failed to land a killing blow on me because he slipped on some blood. It engaged me better than some AAA First person RPGs did.    The story was well written for the first act, and leaves you hungry for more. The NPCs are enjoyable to interact with and the relationships they have with the PC and his party actually make sense.‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•a trader off enough he/she will stop trading. Steal from someone, you have to return the goods and get back in his good will before talking to him again.   The graphics are nice and the UI and controls aren't annoying. The AI is smart and for the most part doesn't get in your way. You just have to watch out for the sight lines of hostiles. The AI party members tend to stick very closely to the PC but if you're trying to squeeze past a narrow space they may accidentally walk into hostile sight lines triggering a fight. That's a very nity-picky problem that can easily be solved by watching out for your party better.  The freedom that this game gives you in actions and choices really is unparalleled.  I reccommend getting it now and enjoying it, but even if you wait I believe every RPG fan who wants to really feel immersion should get this game. Get it now, or get it later it doesn't matter so long as you get the game. You won't regret it."
Miyokari,971,9,0,"October 21, 2017",Recommended,179.0,"After finishing the game (took me around 105 hours on classic mode while playing on MP with my friend) I have to admit the game is great. Going from soundtrack, to gameplay, and the story.  Soundtrack : The music in the game is really good, the orchestral OST really makes the game, many locations and fight have fitting music for what they are. It's good to listen to the game OST even outside the game or use it in Roleplay sessions, I cannot add anything more to be honest... The soundtrack is truly great.  Gameplay : The gameplay is really good, I love turn-based combat in games and it is very refined combat from the first game. You can use envinronment in your advantage, set up poison and during the combat light it on fire, set up barrles of oil and poison ready to be destroyed and many more things which I really love about the combat. The gameplay itself is very nice, camera movement is nice and you can move it around however you want, the dialogue menu is pretty good. My only gripe was inventory but it's because it was mess thanks to my own fault (but auto sort button is pretty nice)  Story : It's good, great, awesome. The dialogues are very well written, the NPCs are ""alive"", it feels like they are real people, the talking with animals and them giving you quests is great addition to the game. Companions are also well written making it like you are adventuring actually with real people, with their own problems, agendas, interrupting talks sometimes to add something of their own. The game had as well really interesting plot twists in some places.  I can wholeheartedly recommend the game, as it become one of my favorite RPG of all time, among Baldur's Gate, Fallout and Planescape Torment"
Lametta,466,9,2,January 30,Recommended,104.9,"If you love RPGS and don't mind turnbased tactical combat this game is for you.  Larian did imrpove on Divivinity OS 1 and made this game much better. In retrospect D:OS 1 (even though i liked it) looks like a prototype/proof of concept in comparsion to this iteration.  The Good:  -Combat system is great. Especially the adition of Physical and Magical Armor. -Likeable Companions with their own story. -Better Graphics, Effects and animations (compared to D:OS1) -Overall better Combat system (but some small annoyances) -Loads Of content (Took me about 100 hours to finish the game) -Great Soundtrack -Improvements on unique playstyles (Playing undead etc)  The Bad: -The story. Even though betetr than the story of D:OS and even though it is passable it wasn't that interesting to me. Occasionally the side story fo the companion characters were much more interesting to me. -There are still bugs(e.g. Even though i choos e a different ending i got another one->won't go into detail so i won't spoil a thing) -Small annoyances in combat: Source Point system wasn't going really anywhere for me. Should have been refined.; Some enemies have annoying abilities: Cursed Wardens/Necrofire........ -At the last chapter some of the quests are knda tedious. Sometimes more is less.   Anyhow, all in all one of my most favourite RPGs of all time I think.  Let's hope Divinity 3 will be even better.  p.s.:If you liked the D:OS series you could always go back and try Divine Divinity (Diablo like 2d game) or Divinity 2 Director's Cut(Gothic/Risen kinda game with skills and dragon transformation.) Both are great games in their own rights."

Tybreaker,65,31,7,March 23,Recommended,847.9,"Was a struggle start - felt overpowered by everything.  Gradually learned the game's secrets from other players through the forums.  First turn-based RPG I've played and each fight was really interesting, a bit like chess because you had to carefully use your turns or the game would kick your sweet patootie.  The biggest weakness for me was the game didn't seem to keep up with the changing context eg you may have completed a mission in a particular way and characters in the game would still be talking to you about it as if you hadn't done it yet.  This is probably because the game provides so much freedom that the devs couldn't possibly predict what every player might choose in every instance.  The final fight was a bit of a fizzer - I befriended the main villains so that they helped me fight the prime villain - so that ended him relatively quickly and then it was pretty much over - I didn't even have to kill the rest of them.  I don't really get the name of the game - the divnity bit is obvious but what was the original sin?  And how was this different from the first game which I didn't play?"

The moment I saw this was in EA, I didn't even speak the words ""Shut up and take my money!"" I just shut up and paid.  I highly recommend you do the same!  I can say without reservation, this will be one of 2017's greatest games (T:ToN is going to be a close rival, no doubt), and this will probably become a game I spend many hundreds more hours in.  (And now for an in-character moment, with my favorite Sourcerer, Ifan-ban-Mezd) Hmm, I want that ring he has but wow, it's expensive.  Ok, smile, nod, just keep talking, ""hmm, mm-hmm, that's interesting... oranges you say... uh-huh"" ""(here, put on these two rings and go 'round behind him, then nip his best stuff).""  ""He had a couple of smallish, dangerous-looking things.  Here, take 'em."" ""Yes, oh my, fascinating.  Say, why don't we have a little trade?""  I sell him back his own stuff, and trade for that ring at a pittance.  Later on, I'll kill him outright, and take back all the stuff we ""traded"".  Role-playing is fun, and profitable!  Once you master the mechanics, you can still see the 'gaminess' behind it all, but in truth, that doesn't really dimish the fun!  Learning to think strategically, then planning your next run with min/max, then tailoring each *ahem* ""event"" to your advantage, this cycle never gets old!  AND THIS IS ONLY THE ALPHA!!  The updates from the Dev during EA have brought sweeping, wonderful changes, posted even with some bit of regularity.  The videos are interesting and fun, and each update brings new elements to exploit ... test. If you have ever enjoyed any parts of any role-playing or party-scale strategy game, buy D:OS2; you won't regret it!  I'm stoked for the final release, and who knows, maybe they'll even do a full EE for this one (or maybe they'll just drop the full, voice-acted, massive epic on us all at once, in a surprise on release day; because that's just how awesome this team is!)."
Rizzit,76,17,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,242.2,"This is a 230 Hours review on Tactician.   TLDR: This game is 10/10 and deserves a spot in the RPG Hall of Fame. IT is a must buy hands down.  Pros:  - Story: Amazing Introduction that ramps up to a very good confusing mid game meltdown and ends in emotional chaos. - Gameplay: Top Notch, skills, spells, interactions, AI, everything feels smooth and fights never get boring. - Length: You dont know when the game is finally over it is soooo long and thats a good thing - Difficulty: On Tactician the game starts absolutely brutal, towards the end it unfortunately becomes easier except a few exceptions who are crazy hard again.   Cons:  - Merchants: 1 Hour waiting to get a chance of new piece of gear, no gear leveling with you, lots of unique armors or weapons capped at level 18. You can fix this though by using mods but then you get no achievements. It's not noticeable until the very end but then you notice it very hardly, to the point you go afk for 1 hour to get some new gear.  - Skills: Some skills felt lacking, especially the source skills resolve into 2-3 being better then all the others which makes you feel pidgeon holed since the enemies on harder diffs are going to spam you with the good stuff. Some skills npc's use cant be learned... also you cant make true new classes in the SDK currently which is a big downer  - Story: I understand that with so many choices it gets more complex to keep track of everything, sometimes the game does not explain or give you a chance on understanding why a character in the story would do something. One example would be Gareth if you chose to destroy everyone but side with him always, he still will be opposing you at the end while not explaining why so yeah thats unfortunately not the only story let downs.  - Thievery: only 1 pickpocket per NPC per character this is ridiculous by the astronomical prices you have to pay and the minimal gold you get for selling stuff.

Enzevil,393,14,2,June 23,Recommended,117.5,"It was about time I write a review about Divinity: Original Sin 2. Let me start off with this: it's one of the best RPGs I've ever played, and this game ended up in my personal top 10 favorite games of all time. So if you're curious about why it's so good, read on!  Divinity: Original Sin 2 starts off with the choice to create your own character, or to pick one of the Origin characters. Origin characters are full fledged characters with a personal background, but you can still choose how you want to play them. These Origin characters can be your party members throughout the game, so I found it more insteresting to have my main character be self made.  The game really has a tabletop RPG (like Dungeons & Dragons) feel to it. You can really choose how you want to play. In most games, if you want to be a Jack of all Trades, you're a master of none. In this game, you're a master of all. Because the more skills you combine, the better results you get. For example, if you choose to be a Sorcerer, you can combine water with lightning or with ice. If you first use a water spell, the ice or lightning spell will have a greater effect on the enemy. You will be well rewarded for creativity.  It also has a tactical turn-based combat system. Even movement and placement is key in combat, as well as your (combination of) skills of course. It can take a little while to get used to, but damn, the combat is awesome. It's not like other normal turn-based game, where you obviously have a best skill to use every turn. It really requires tactical thinking, and it feels really rewarding if your plan worked in combat.  The roleplaying aspect is wonderful. Not everything has to be solved my combat. There are always multiple ways to solve things, even in side quests. Not only does your background matter, but also your race. Every background and race have multiple and different roleplaying options, even for the Origin characters, who also have unique dialouge options. Oh, and yes, there are romance options in the game as well.  The goal is to become a God, literally, but the biggest accomplishment is the journey. Yes, this sounds cliche, but you will really feel this after completing this game. Are you satisfied with the choices you made, to become a God? Maybe you can't even become a God, because of the choices you made. After completing this game, it really made me think twice about the choices I made in my journey and it's really magnificent if a game can do that for me.  I'm really grateful for completing this game. It was a wonderful experience and it has so much to offer, even compared to other modern RPGs nowadays. I really recommend this game if you like RPGs or games with tactical combat. Also worth noting: Divinity: Original Sin 2 Definitive Edition will launch in August and is free for all owners of this game. So even if you're waiting for the that, get this one now and you'll receive the Definitive Edition later, for free!"

Jayco√ü,262,11,0,"September 8, 2017",Recommended,406.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2  is everything the first game was but better and more. There's more options character wise (many different races), more possible outcomes of events and your decisions, more spellls, more everything!      The story is quite interesting, because this time around it seems to be more serious, dark and characters you meet (especially your companions) have their own unique storylines and motives which make you want to learn more about them, understand their POVs and interact with them (very reminiscent of the legendary Baldur's Gate games). After beating Act 1 I'm absolutely hooked and cannot help but wonder how their stories might unfold and what suprises await along the way.  UPDATE: The full game has come out and just as I expected it's bloody brilliant. Made it past the zone from early acces and there's so much to do, so much content that it's overwhelming. Best RPG ever!!!     The combat is more satisfying and rewarding than ever. It encourages creative thinking and approach to your encounters, as well as using the environment to your advantage. There's new spells and spell schools, including summoning and polymorph as well as many additions and positive changes to the old ones. The turn based battles feel a lot more fluid and engaging thanks to many mobility options characters got (grow wings and fly away, charge at your enemies or jump back - there's always an option). And of course You have the option to play the campaign with a buddy or a random person online. There's also a game master, dnd like mode coming which looks very promising. Exploration and experimenting with crafting and such is very rewarding and satisfying.    The audio is stunning, with a remarkable main theme chorus music that I cannot help but to hum to myself as  I wait for full release! Game let's you pick a favorite out of 4 instuments (oud, tamborine, bansuri and cello) the sounds of which get mixed in battle music as well as pivotal moments in your campaign, crafting a really memorable experience.     As far as graphics go they definitely feel like an improvement. Especially the character models and the armor design are gorgeous, where in the first game characters felt small and rather generic looking, with not many visual changes affecting them along the way, this time around each character and race look unique, feel big, present and meaningful in the game's world. Landscapes are beautiful and monsters you encounter look nasty (in a good way) and threatening.   Overall, I am very VERY impressed with what I experienced in the game and absolutely cannot reccommend this game enough. You can really tell the game was made with love, passion and care. (A very rare thing to find in modern games). This is, I swear the best RPG I've ever played."

Mr.Yellow,566,16,6,"January 11, 2017",Recommended,201.4,"It's short and very much unfinished thus far, and yet has utterly surprised me by being one of the most fun co-op experiences I've had in a while. While it has some issues, for Early Access it has a level of polish unheard of in most games that aren't yet fully released (and also some that are).  The systems seem well thought out, 4 player multiplayer is a massive improvement, the game looks quite lovely not even just in raw graphics but more importanly in visual design, playing as the Red Prince and picking the most Vegeta like dialogue just to see what happens is funny to me, the combat is fun and just challenging enough, these are all good points in the game's favour.  But. There is but one thing that draws me in like a moth to a flame. I have never seen such levels of freedom and sandbox design in a fantasy RPG before to the extent where there's just so much room for player dickery. For example, my friend would start conversations with NPC's like some kind of Strangey McWeirdo who actually wants to advance the plot instead of committing petty crimes for even pettier reasons (I know right?). So, while he's talking, learning story and lore, and just generally enjoying the writing I decided to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• him over for a laugh.  Even outside of combat you can sneak as long as you don't enter an NPC's Line of sight, and the NPC's sight was focused on my poor friend and not her valuables and I. Needless to say I made off with her shoes, a potion, and some fish the last of which i sent to my friend's inventory as they were still talking. One (what I can only assume to be magical) cavity search later and my friend was in prison while I was grabbing many, many, crates all of which sell for 1 gold to get my pants back after a guard took them from me the last time I got busted for petty theft.  10/10 Would have a kleptomaniac episode again."
Prahett,193,16,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,130.3,"If you like Divinity: Original Sin, you'll LOVE this game. Plays like the first, but with a lot more to do in battles, around the world and interacting with NPCs and your party. Theres that same humor that the last game had, so youll still find those flavor items and people in the world. The graphics are beautiful and the world looks vibrant and captivating. The writing is as good, if not better then DSO, with an added narrator and voices with every NPC. Battles are like they were in the original, but they'd added more spells and abilites, as well as an armor mechanic for both physical and magical damage. Over all a great game 23.5 hours!"

Larian Studios really knocked this one out of the park with stunning visuals, soundtrack, voice overs, story, near flawless newtwork and online co-op. The list goes on and on. I could only wish all game releases were this way, so rich and full, without extra fluffs or DLC's hiding bits and pieces of it away.  About the only thing I could fault this for is not letting have the campaign assets for the GM mode, I want The Lady Vengeance map for a campaign darnit!   This game is a 10 out of 10, great package, worth every penny, would recommend it to anyone who likes RPG's. Even more fun if you play with friends, lord knows we all laughed and cried we found out how volatile mixing poison and fire is. Hehe..."
Nexwolf | Shahr,196,8,0,"January 22, 2017",Recommended,118.4,"Recommended. Very Recommended. Please note though: - Currently in early access. This is fine for me but you are currently only able to access the first act. There are plenty of bugs to be worked and features not yet added out as you would expect from an early access pre-beta release. That said, though, the first act is A+++  D:OS 2 is a  turn based RPG based on gear, skill points and abilities, elements etc. A strategic game for sure. This was exactly the sort of game I was looking for and expecting as I was a huge fan of the original.  This game manages to capture what made the original great and expand on it in so many ways, with the ability depth, more grim story and great style (even when running on a potato).  There are plenty of features still to be implimented (such as local coop) as one would expect from an early access release. That said, however, you can be at ease as this is a company that has illustrated clearly in the past that they deliver big time on any promises made during the development period.   Overall, if you're looking for a strategic, turn based RPG look no further."
Pixlow,305,44,19,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,244.5,"Paid some pimp in a tavern a 100 gold for a prostitude. Went up to the prostitude and had a long good talk about how she should actually be paying me for it, then said ""Now that we have established who is the most desireable here, i will take my leave"". She got mad and said i couldn't get a refund. Little did she know that i already had stolen my money back from her pimp.   10/10 Would steal from pimps and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• with prostitudes again.   But in all honesty the game is great, the story is much easier to follow now that it is voice acted in my personal opinion. Upon reaching Reaper's Coast i have experianced some slight problems with perfomance, but other than that, the game has been going smoothly.   The turn based combat gets spiced up by the ground effects, you can either make great use of those mechanics or they can be your doom. Saving before battle is recommended. When combat gets challenging there is no shame in reloading a save to come up with new strategies to defeat your foe. Running from combat might also be the smartest move in some situations.  The origin characters give a nice dynamic to the singleplayer game, having them in your party leads to some memorable events between you and them. When you interract with an npc they have interrest in, they will let you know, you can either allow them to do their buisness or keep them away. This will lead to you bonding with that character. If they do something you do not like, you can often have a talk about it afterwards.  The music in the game is pretty good, but sometimes there is some mishaps where a piece of music that is out place plays. Nothing gamebreaking, but you can lose a bit of your immersion. You are able to pick 1 of 4 instruments when you make a character, you will hear these instruments being played in the level up music and etc.  Persuasion checks have been a little confusing for me, sometimes when i believe i definantly should be able to pass the skill check for an option i fail and other times where i think i should have failed, i passed. No idea if it is randomized or how it works."

jimbobslimbob,243,10,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,128.1,"It's a turn-based isometric RPG which attempts to do what Sword Coast Legends never did: make a computer game that captured the essence of PnP, complete with campaign editor (not tried yet, since this is an EA review), GM mode and true RPG-freedom-of-choice. It is very similar to RPG's of old, like Neverwinter Nights, Baldurs Gate etc.  I have only completed Act 1 so far, since that's all that exists in the early access version, but I am hooked. The game is a joy to play. Difficult at times, yet rewarding too. It offers true freedom of choice in the way you play and create your character. It features a classless character system so you are free to do whatever you want with your character. It also features various ""origin"" characters which are kind of pre-generated characters with fleshed out backgrounds (the kind of thing you do yourself in a D&D campaign). You can choose to play one of those or alternatively make up your own and recruit them in game.  There are many ways to solve the quests in game, offering a lot of replay value. Race, ""tags"" (such as Outlaw etc.) all make NPC's treat you differently and offer various other ways to do things. The co-op gameplay (up to 4 players) has also been specifically designed with this in mind, meaning your party may not always see eye-to-eye on things. This creates the potential for some interesting RP scenarios.  Although the version I played does not yet feature a GM mode or level editor, this looks to be the icing on the cake and could significantly increase play-time. They will also offer Steam Workshop support for ""click-and-play"" modding.  Now all they need to do is offer the ability to import/export characters...  Summary Overwhelming to begin with, but once you get to grips with the game mechanics you realise just how well crafted this game is. Gorgeous graphics, wonderful sound and music, solid turn-based tactical combat and endless replay value.  Jimbo Rating: 8/10 "
Avigoat,9,15,1,August 5,Recommended,85.9,I would compare this game to the show death note where the first half is absolutley amazing but the second half is lackluster. The first half of the game in driftwood there are so many quests and things to do each quest just as interesting as the last with an immersive city that feels like its lived in but then in the second half when your're on the 3rd island idk what happened  it lost its magic with an island where all you do is pray infront of stones and there are no other quests than the one main storyline. When you reach arx after that very dissapointing island it gets a bit better there are some quests to do other than the main story and they are interesting as well. The combat through the entire game is great. Good progression to feel like your character is truly ready to become divine and if you play this game with a friend it is a great experience that for me kept me wanting to play this game till the end. This game is definitly worth the first 40 hours to immerse yourself in the world however the 3rd and 4th island of the game falls short to the rest.

Zurv,860,7,0,"October 16, 2017",Recommended,153.7,"This game is fantastic. One of the best RPGs I‚Äôve played.  Larian created a rich and living world to play in. The story (unlike the DOS1) is good with twists and turns. There are tons of side quest and normally multi ways to finish them. (yes, murdering everyone is an option‚Ä¶ but then you might miss out on more story/exp.) The interaction of ‚Äúsystems‚Äù they setup, from how elements react with other elements/spells to actions in the world people see you do. It makes for great combat and a lot of creative way how to deal with enemy/issues. I did play the first game (Divinity Original Sin) so I had an idea of how the game worked. (side note, there is no reason to play the first game. While great, it task soooo long to get going that many players will bounce off it.) I didn‚Äôt find the game or it‚Äôs systems confusing because of that.. maybe? Do not expect the game to tell you explicitly how to play. It isn‚Äôt ‚Äúhardcore‚Äù that you need to just work it out yourself. It will subttlely tell you how to play via the interface. My advice is take it slow. This is one of those games that you search everyone, read everything, talk to everyone. ÔÅä Save a lot. (f5 key) Not because it is hard, but you might change to change how some event is going once you see what is happening. Honestly my biggest ‚Äúproblem‚Äù with the game is a massive fear that I‚Äôm going to miss something. (which you can totally do.. it is very easy.) Did I miss some book? I did not ask the right question? Did I have a skill to low and missed seeing some hidden item/switch/etc‚Ä¶ argh! That said, there is so much here it isn‚Äôt a big deal to miss some side stuff. But.. but.. I want to see it all.. so.. there is some stress there. Getting to the last big area was very stressful for me as I started to feel overwhilemd  The quest log isn‚Äôt super great. It isn‚Äôt always clear what the next steps are‚Ä¶ but in the defense of the game it really isn‚Äôt a check list of this but more a log of what you are doing. (but it would still be nice if they said if X quest is going to end of it leave area Y or if it will keep going.)  Totally get this magical game, but do expect to bump into a learning curve if you‚Äôve not play RPGs before. (of course there is an ‚Äúexplorer‚Äù (or something like that) which might be a way to get into the game a little ez‚Äôr.) There is co-op in the game too.. but I personally don‚Äôt see how that would be fun. Each person in your party is a part of your strategy. Well, at least play with someone you know and not a rando. )  Most people will restart the game after a few hours after they get an idea how the party they want and rolls/skills they want. But don‚Äôt super stress it. After you leave the first island you‚Äôll be able to re-roll all you people skills/stats/etc (and as any times as you want.. free. The game isn‚Äôt setup to screw you over if you made a bad choice.  "

Xilil,57,14,0,"September 16, 2016",Recommended,127.9,"Everything that made Original Sin 1 is in here, plus loads of extras that add to the experience.  Character development now allows for much more flexibility. In OS1 it was pretty hard to make some original combos like a battlemage because of the way skills and attributes worked. Now it feels like characters are much more customizable to whatever crazy combination you want to have.  The graphics are also a huge improvement. The PBR-rendering makes everything look stunning while preserving the nice aesthetics of the first game.  The single player Act that is available to Early Acces offers a lot of content. The replayability is also quite high. There are quite a lot of ways to complete your goals, which will make every playthrough a bit different.   The only problem that I think this sequel still has, is that sometimes it's hard to find the content for your level. Because of this you sometimes end up just running around looking for those level 4's you still need to kill to level up.   I thought PvP was going to be kind of nice, but that is quite the understatement. The PvP is one of the best PvP experiences I had in a long time. There's so much depth to it, while still keeping it fun. This is were the additions in combat from Original Sin 1 really show their beauty with Source skills and tons of new surface combo's like blessed fire. I just hope there will be a matchmaking system eventually because the server browser isn't that good in my opinion. People try to put up private matches in public, so everytime someone joins they instantly kick them.  Which brings me to my last complaint, which is that the game visibility of single player is the same as the visibility of multiplayer. This means that if you want to play single player, and right after that create an arena lobby, you have to change the setting every single time.  In conclusion I think it still has its flaws which is normal ofcourse, but at its current state it is already a beautiful and fun game."

Sgt. McSergeantface,85,9,1,July 4,Recommended,237.0,"Why exactly you are reading reviews for Divinity: Original Sin 2? I doubt you were just browsing store. You were looking for RPG, don‚Äôt you? Or maybe you‚Äôve heard somewhere about this phenomenal game and just checking out. Or maybe you don‚Äôt actually trust this unstoppable hype train, do you?      TL; DR. Buy. Play. Replay. Get Enhanced for free. Replay.     Well, every praised thing you might have heard about this outstanding game is 100% true. My life is now divided into ‚Äúbefore‚Äù and ‚Äúafter‚Äù Divinity: Original Sin 2.   Larian Studios - creators of Divinity - is company of people, that actually works with players and for players. I will remind you, it is an indie project financed on a crowdfunding platform. Game has inherited all the best parts from previous instance. However, it is an understatement to tell that OS2 improved things. Sequel has added so much more, it has surpassed every existing game and doubled, tripled the level of today‚Äôs RPGs, adding everything we didn‚Äôt dare to dream about.   We want to choose playable races! - Ok, here‚Äôs four. And you can make a playable undead character. We want more companions! - Fine. And they are living humans - play with three of your friends.   We want more magic and perks! - Here 4 more skill schools and mix them up to unlock more perks. We want to make love to our party members! - No problem. You also can punch ‚Äòem in a face anytime. We want personal quests! - Welcome playable characters with prewritten origins and their own story arc. We want more stories! - Here‚Äôs Game Master mode and dedicated modding support.   Everyone knows, how much time it takes sometimes to create your character: skills, abilities, talents, etc. Eventually it took me twice as much, because I just couldn‚Äôt stop admiring visual design of characters, feasting my eyes while scrolling different races and skill presets, to see as character‚Äôs model switches his looks. In addition to looks and technical part of your avatar, there are two notable things in character creation. First, if you build your own character (not pre-created), you can add some personality traits, which together with race will reflect on your social interactions (i.e. dialog options). Second, choose one of four musical instruments - game‚Äôs musical score will dynamically change leading instrument, when your character does something awesome. Imagine epic cello or bansuri solo when your hero is unleashing some hell on pity enemies! More to this: do not bother with perfect build, try fresh ideas, experiments and bold choices - Divinity will allow you to change your specs midgame numerous times if you think you‚Äôve messed up.   Combat system maybe the one thing that has changed heavily in sequel, a lot of things were reconsidered. For me personally it was hard to get used to changes right after first game, but in hours I‚Äôve found it even more satisfying. However, keep in mind that straightforward face punching still not the option. Tactics has moved into third dimension - do not underestimate high ground. And of course, don‚Äôt forget to utilize everything you can reach, that‚Äôs including you pockets and your surroundings. Found yourself standing fenced in a fire - use water barrel to extinguish it or bless fire and stand your fight in cleansing flames. Got bullied by a brute - teleport yourself out, or teleport enemy‚Äôs sorry‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•on lava. Some of most efficient tactics are those that not first come to mind.   Plot isn‚Äôt connected to Original Sin. Sequel is provided with its own overarching narrative and several personal story arcs of origin characters (which also serve as companions) and particular factions. Everything is interconnected in some complicated manner, it was the reason of bugs and some general frustration, because one path leads to impasse on other story thread (fixed by further patching). However, game doesn‚Äôt hold your hand and never questions your approach to advance the story. E.g., first thing you are tasked with after tutorial section - get out of concentration camp, and then you can look for someone to help you with this, help others for info on how to get out, murder your way out, lie your way out, or fly away, if you have the ability, without even meeting anyone. Plot progression is not just 3-4 options, but absolutely non-linear. Basically, you can roam where the wind blows the whole game, you will always find yourself on a right path.   World of Rivellon has changed. At first, after whole shiny hunky-dory previous game, it was tough to find yourself in a place that is harsh, cruel and mean as Wild West. People will lie to you, use you, and you absolutely will find yourself in a situation, where the line between good and evil is blurred into wide grey area, where all alignments are subjective. Look, I have lost the faith in what I had been doing halfway through and have to reconsider my view on things - it is impressive storytelling for a video game.   Music in game is kept on astonishing level, with memorable scores and even few actual songs, that are closely tied to game‚Äôs narrative. Soundtrack is notably adaptative to surroundings and players interactions. Thousands of lines of dialogs were voiced perfectly, with distinct accents and proper manners respective to in-game personalities. Surprising addition is in-game Narrator, that makes you journey more immersive and closer to tabletop gaming. Narrator‚Äôs commentary on things are so neat and detailed, you can basically enjoy your ride with eyes closed.   Persuasion, as a vital part in RPG gameplay, has changed. Creators ditched that awkward ‚Äúrock, paper, scissors‚Äù minigame, though there is no any kind of randomizer behind now. However, success not solely depends on your persuasion skill level: very neat thing is involving physical attributes into check, like trying to reason with someone adds your intelligence bonus, while intimidating is much easier with high strength.   Most of the game earlier criticism was based on overabundance of bugs, inconsistencies and even script deadlocks. However, Larian never stopped patching and fixing and up all holes and mistakes, therefore every month after release players received long lists of patch notes. As for now most of things are shiny, polished and perfectly balanced. Moreso, Larian is readying an Enhanced Edition for release, where everything is refined and glossy, and with reworked third and fourth chapters of the story, which got their fair share of judgement from players. No point of waiting for release, as owners of current version will receive a new one.   Divinity OS2 requires your time and energy investment. There is so much in this phenomenal game, you are not able to treat it as a casual walk in a park. Managing characters party, inventory and crafting, diving deep into each story, heck, even most of the important combat encounters are challenging and will take a lot more time that you think, with all the tactical possibilities. However, if you are ready to enter immense world of fantasy, magic, political intrigue, adventure, love and betrayal - there is no better way than playing Divinity: Original Sin 2."

A Catgirl is Fine Too,394,20,2,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,108.5,"The first Original Sin game was my favorite title of 2014, and I have been impatiently waiting for the sequel from the moment I finished it. I am pleased to report that it has been well worth the wait. Larian Studios have a fundamental understanding of what makes a good sequel: Divinity: Original Sin 2 keeps the things that made the original great, and builds on the areas that were lacking.   The art design is even more stunning than before, and the one act currently available is packed with things to do. I've already found numerous clever ways to solve both major and minor quests. Combat, arguably the most important aspect of the game, has remained largely the same, with the addition of new mechanics such as height and cursed surfaces to keep things fresh. The plot in the first game was one of my few complaints, as it felt generic and poorly paced in places. However, in Original Sin 2 I find myself much more intrigued and very much like what I have seen of the story so far. Although the game is still in early access as I write this, it already feels like a straight upgrade from Original Sin 1.  As far as criticism goes, the music currently feels slightly lackluster, although being able to choose a special instrument to play during climactic moments is a novel idea. One of my complaints from the first game was that by the end of it, combat had begun to feel tedious. As I said, combat is still fundamentally the same, but I have yet to explore all the new features and I hope they keep combat exciting across my multiple inevitable playthroughs.   Of course, as an early access title, bugs and glitches come with the territory, but I have yet to experience a game-breaking one. I am currently playing on ultra on a moderately powerful laptop, and performance has been stable, with an average FPS of 60-65.   In conclusion, did you like Divinity: Original Sin? If yes, you'll love this one too. If for some reason you didn't, you're not going to find a completely new experience here, although it might have fixed what you disliked. If you're new to the franchise, I'd always suggest buying the finished first game over the unfinished early access game, but if you're a fan of turn-based RPGs you'll likely get more than your money's worth. I have a huge amount of respect for Larian Studios and I don't doubt for a second that Divinity: Original Sin 2 will only get better from here. "
axfelix,267,13,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,113.0,"Man, it's so good. They took what was already the most flexible, fun, and modern CRPG out there and made the engine even more expansive and the game weirder and more interesting.  I would actually recommend playing the first one first if you haven't; it's not really needed for plot reasons (there are a few returning characters but nothing major) but it's a little easier to get a handle on, hardly any less impressive, and in the meantime this sequel could probably still use another few months of polish patches. It's hardly anything to hold against it given the scope, and I didn't hit a single bug I'd consider really significant, but the farther you get into the game the more broken the quest flags start to feel and the more minor continuity issues the dialogue starts to have and the more combat balance starts to break.

On that note, play the first game first, it's great, and if you like it then come to this one. The two big notes I have about this game are that it's dumb you can freely respec, and tactician mode is a major dissapointment compared to tactician mode in the first game. It's predominantly just an enemy stat buff (+50% to damage, vitality, and armor) and that's about it. It's most just artificial difficulty for if you played the game through a few times and want to have it challenge you again.  Overall I like it a lot, but I admit I don't quite love it like I did the first game."
Dralek,315,6,1,"October 6, 2017",Recommended,294.2,"This game is amazing.  I can't stop playing it.  Let's start out with the first thing you do in the game; character customization.  You have 4 races to choose from, each with their own unique traits, backstory, and affect how everyone treats you.  Lizards can dig without a shovel, Dwarves can crawl into small spaces nobody else can, Elves can eat body parts to learn the memories of the fallen (sometimes gaining skills in the process), and so forth.  You've got a lot of choices for playstyles as well, and it's not set in stone.  You could start off the game as a wizard, then transition into a battlemage who charges into the fray, then unleashes spells that require proximity.  Then, you've got the Tags.  Basically, they let you set up your own backstory, as well as giving additional dialogue options when the time is right.  Mystics can sometimes talk to the gods, whilst Barbarians want a *simple* solution to many problems.  But the best is yet to come...  and it's something that I'm a bit of a sucker for.  Music.  You can set the lead instrument on the soundtrack.  It's only four instruments, and the one you choose will be, well, the prominent instrument throughout the soundtrack.  Not a fan of character customization?  That's fine, you can select an Origin character.  These guys normally would be optional party members if you were to create your own character, but you can also play as them for your main character.  The choices are really interesting too; a lizard who cavorted with demons and got exiled, wanting to reclaim his empire; or a human who is a host of all kinds of spirits while a demon is trying to wrest control of her body.  They all have pre-set tags, but you can choose the class they start with.  Now for the gameplay.  Out of battle, stuff is simple; everything is performed from your clicking (duh).  However, even outside of combat your skills are still tested.  Persuasion can be a way to get out of a fight, or get more information out of someone, bartering lowers prices for you.  You can also steal stuff too, but be warned if you played the first game; the stealing has been revamped by quite a lot.  You can no longer just walk into someone's house, close the door and sneak about, stealing everything that isn't bolted down.  The moment you take something, no matter if you're sneaking or not, the townsfolk will become suspicious and try to search you.  Of course, there's ways to make sure they don't succeed, but I'll leave that since a lot of this game is about finding your own playstyle.  The combat is not really changed by much from the first game, but many more complexities have been added.  Surfaces play a crucial role to a mage just like before, however they have many more options due to the magic trees.  Water can be frozen, electrified, or turned into steam which can also be electrified.  Bless can actually turn surfaces, well, blessed, healing characters who travel through it.  (That includes everyone, so make sure blessed surfaces can't be accessed by the enemy.)  However, there is also Cursed surfaces, which carry extra effects to them.  Necrofire can't be put out by normal water, Cursed Oil can go off on MOVEMENT, and so forth.  Armor is no longer a stat that simply decreases damage received, it is instead its own bar.  This bar is crucial to manage, as it stops status effects.  Think of it as a shield; as long as you have a shield up, you can't be affected by the status of a surface your character may be standing on, with certain exceptions as Oil that slows you down.  As a general rule of thumb however, the game's combat is very challenging.  There really isn't many fights that have ""cannon fodder"" enemies; everyone is dangerous and they all know how to take advantage of the same things you do.  Be careful about that water you're standing on, for that mage on higher ground likely might have an electric spell he could cast, if your magic armor is down, and stun you.  My recommendation?  This game deserves all the praise that it's got and more.  The only real complaint I have is with the camera control, but that's mainly due to my mouse having issues with some games not registering the middle mouse click.  Plus, in battle you can get a top-down view if there's too many obstacles."

Dogg,196,6,0,"November 18, 2017",Recommended,110.3,"**spoiler free**  What a fantastic journey. Every once in a while, you get incredibly hyped for that next game that's about to come out... and every so often, that very game delivers on the hype. This game ultimately did that for me, and I'm almost sad that the journey is now over (unless I start another new game). Starting each category at 10 points.   Visuals: starting at +10 ================ The game's graphics look fantastic. There is a vast amount of polished detail in each and every environment. The developers didn't leave anything out. Even areas you may only explore once, if only for a couple of minutes, got all the same polished details as areas that you'll be spending hours upon hours inside of. Brilliant, long, hard work went into sewing the fields of this game's visuals, and the developers are reaping the fantastic benefits of that hard work. Well done.  + No real cons here. I never had any screen tearing and rarely saw any seams throughout the world.  Final score: 10/10    Sound/Music: +10 ============= For anyone who has read my past reviews, you'll know I use the word ""weight"" a lot when it comes to sound effects. This ""weight"" means that for each and every major sound effect in the game, there should typically be some kind of ""impact"" behind them. It doesn't have to be a big ""boom"" for that to work. It can be the sounds of butterfly wings flapping in the wind (which would be incredibly hard to hear), or it can be a loud thunderbolt. Either way, whichever object or environment a sound effect has been stuck in/onto, it has to have a strong feeling behind it. This is not easy to explain, but let's just say that Divinity Original Sin 2 pulls it off extremely well.  + All abilities sound effects, even ones that are as simple as throwing a dagger, feel heavy. There is strength behind them. No ability is left out, nothing is in the ""filler"" category. Excellent.  + Music appears to be orchestra, and it's great. Battle music pumps you up. ""Majestic"" music calms you down, and provides a sense of relief behind it. It all sounds fantastic.  + Pre-final battle music setup is excellent (only those who've played the game will understand).  + Great voice work across all characters, both major and minor.  Final score: 10/10    Performance: +10 ============= Overall, the game runs well.   + When everything is working, it performs at 60 FPS, constantly.  +/- Long long load times between regions. I mark this as neither a plus or a minus due to the fact that once you're loaded in, there are no load times whatsoever. The game loads everything upon entry (this is why is takes so long).  - Bugs bugs and more bugs. Nothing game breaking fortunately. A common theme when it comes to Larian Studios games. The good news is, most bugs are extremely minor. Quest bugs WILL be contracted, inhibiting you from actually completing a quest. Other quest related bugs include 1) actually completing a quest, but it never leaving your quest log. 2) you have option A and option B to choose from. You chose option A, but the game will say you chose option B. -1  - Certain battles have frustrating situations where a turn will not end immediately, forcing you to wait for up to 5-10 minutes at a time for each turn to finally end (even though nothing is happening). This will hopefully be patched in the near future. It was not patched in this playthrough. -1  - Game will crash every now and then. -1  - Strange lag issues in regards to certain spells (such as blood storm). These lag issues will persist until the specific spell (or spells) animations have completely ended, sometimes several turns after being cast. -1  Final score: 6/10   Story: +10 ======== You are a source wielder. You've been captured and you're about to sent to what would closely resemble a ""prison island"" to serve out your remaining days. It's time to escape! This is where the adventure begins.  + Premade characters all have an actual personality that you will love or hate. It will slowly be fleshed out as the story progresses, whether for better or for worse. Whichever character you pick (or don't pick, you can make your own too) will still have their main story attached, but you get to make a plethora of extra decisions behind them that will ultimately influence their endgame personality. So don't be afraid to pick the premades (you can also edit their classes and appearances).  + Relevant in-game choices that will affect the endings.  + Special endings for certain characters are available.  - Some scenes would have a far greater impact if it wasn't simply reading text. A few animations here and there wouldn't hurt, especially behind big scenes (that would normally be a cutscene vs an interactable scene). -1  Final score: 9/10    Gameplay: +10 =========== Gameplay hinges upon building your starting character with either physical, magical, or ranged damage types (ranged being both physical and magical, depending on if you're an archer or a mage). You'll run around and collect lots of loot, sell the loot, buy better loot; craft items, scrolls, and potions; learn a vast amount of abilities and even craft secret ""hidden"" abilities; there is plenty to do here, and you will be busy, all while having fun (hopefully).  + Respec any time once you hit Act 2, for free. This will actually probably enrage some players, because they want to feel the weight of locking in their choice of permenant abilities (i.e. Diablo 2). Respecing for me on the other hand was the greatest thing to ever happen in this game. I started as a Battlemage, switched to a full time mage, and then later switched to a mostly full-timer tank/DPS with certain mage support abilities attached. I had another character start as a full healer and supporter, who later stayed as a full healer supporter, but also had fire and ice abilities to help in combat, if they couldn't do anything else. You can experiment to your heart's delight. So get past Act 1, then indulge in the world of change!  + You can play as a skeleton, with facial hair.  + Various unique abilities for each race are well implemented and can provide extra benefits to playing a certain class with a certain race (such as a thief/assassin with an undead, due to getting a free skeleton key to unlock any chest provided you have high enough Thievery skill. No need to buy lockpicks!)  + Crowd control in this game is just as fantastic as it was in the first game, with a vast amount of new CC abilities (like sleeping).  + The addition of Armor and Magic Armor is also fantastic, providing you with protection against CC abilities of both the physical and magical aspects until that chosen armor is depleted (unless you have Glass Cannon).  + Playing with friends is a lot of fun.  +/- Some talents in the game feel wholly useless (Demon and Ice King), while others feel overpowered. I mark this as plus or minus simply because you can respec at any given time. It would only benefit to take certain ""less useful"" talents to quick specific areas of the game, then respec again back to whatever you were originally with. That being said...  - I played the game on Tactician mode (which is basically hard mode) and having a slightly higher fire resistance or slightly lower ice resistance never really made that big of a difference. The enemies in this mode having such incredibly strong physical or magical abilities would typically negate your armor too too quickly, and 15% out of 100% is just not very helpful. Leadership was a much better option, and also freed up the ""wasted"" talent points. These less useful abilites are what you would call ""filler"". -1  Final score: 9/10    Overall: 8.8/10 (44/50 = 0.88) ===================== A well delivered fine wine that will age almost indefinitely for days to come. Will sip on again. Great job to the developers."

They brought out a update which was a entirely new game with voice acting, new camera controls, new missions, more items/skills, everything changed so i played it and it was one of the best games i had played, i bought this on release and held off for a few days to finish the first game.. I tried the arena mode out and it is actually really fun! I then proceeded to the campaign with a friend of mine and was overwhelmed with the character screen for a alpha game.. I created a elf Necromancer.. I will eat everybody's corpse and steal their souls... That is what i love about this game, you can kill every single person in the game and still complete the story.. Well this game you (kind of) tell your own story, each race has it's own dialogue, each trait has it's own dialogue (bandit,rogue,scholar, that kind of stuff) and already for a alpha game seems almost finished! The story only has one act at the moment which i am SUPER BUMMED about but again.. It's alpha. Oh by the way..... There is a game master mode... Yup, you heard, DUNGEON MASTER!

Marcus Butthurticus,"1,198",8,0,May 2,Recommended,170.9,"This game is really a master piece in the RPG genre in modern times.  Simply put it is a charming game with wonderful enviroment in a world that is deeper than one might think. It takes silly bit to far at times but never as far as lets say Borderlands 2 did which to me, ruined the whole game. Original Sin 2 is both a silly and grim story. The turnbased combat is excellent and it works so well with others. Prepare for a lot of backstabs if you play with nasty people! And prepare for twists.   There is not a better multiplayer RPG this side of Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2. The builds you can do are plenty and races bring their own special abilities, especially Elf and Undead have some unique mechanics, like eating body parts to gain memories of the dead and even abilities at times or Undead....being Undead.   There is at times some weird things. Like AI going nuts and doing not so optimal things or certain questlines not working correctly. RPGs with long questlines that the player sometimes managed to screw up by circumventing things by being cheesy is a classic thing in RPGs, The more advanced endings and options for a questline, the more keen to it breaking it is.   Beside these problems, Original Sin 2 is a excellent game, with nice character building, this is probably one of the strongest parts of the game! Just going nuts when it comes to builds. NPCs that are not so bad, Interesting characters and a developed world. Only thing I would want is a longer end act. The last settlement you are in could been a bit bigger to symbolize the size of it. For the next  game I hope to more of the same, even if it has to be crazy AI and questlines that is not always triggered in the correct way. I hope to see a Original Sin 3 in the coming years.  EDIT: I must point out that the issues could all stem from us taking breaks over a month at times which could off have broken things between patches. The game usually works very well otherwise."

Many ways to discover new quests, and many more ways to solve them, rewards creativity and thinking outside the box. Immersive and interesting plot, world might be bright and colourful, but the plot and side-quest can be extremely dark, touching on topics like genocide and child murder. On the downside, there are some balancing issues, UI could be much improved, a fair bit of wrong or placeholder text and content showing up later in the game, and a few bugs.

I've still got a lot of play left in this game - but I dread finishing it and having to wait for the rest. So I'm taking my time. If I can spend a couple of extra hours where someone else would take only 1 I'll be a happy bunny.  Anyways, if you like this sort of game (and honestly who wouldn't?) do yourself a favour and pick this up for you and a friend. Just remember to come into it with the knowledge you're going to have to wait until next year for the full thing."

LugdunonTG,744,16,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,91.7,I loved Divinity: Original Sin both in Co-op and Single player. The first time I played it was that same feeling in D&D when you realise you can do nearly anything. Divinity: Original Sin 2 carries on this legacy incredibly well already considering it's early state. In the short time I've played I met a host of weird and interesting characters. Stumbled upon various quests that aren't just in plain site.  This is the way I love my RPG's this game rewards you for exploring and taking risks. Just because the odds seem against you does not mean they are as long as you use the environment to your advantage. Blood puddles on the floor can become electrified to shock people on them. You can contaminate them to poison people and use fire to cause poison to combust. It's a wonderful game that I feel like will improve on the original in every way once it's finished. The early version does contain bugs and is obviously missing many aspects but if you wanna just mess around with builds or the new PvP modes then now is as good a time to jump in as any as long as you realise its not fully fleshed out YET. High recommendation from me for all RPG fans.   https://youtu.be/LxvdYIl1IMI  Here's some Gameplay if you wish to see more and I may consider making this a series with enough interest otherwise I check back every few updates.

If you like ""real"" RPGS with choices that matter, deep combat system, story, loads of customization and possibilities, then you must buy this game. There is even a mode that allows you to play D&D style multiplayer with friends, you create your own adventures and can be the ""dungeon master"" in that mode, dice rolls and all. Just an awesome RPG, could be game of the year 2017."

There are discords dedicated to finding and hosting groups, no need to hope for a reply on the steam forums or join random groups in the browser. It's so much more enjoyable, but frustrating at the same time. Learn to love fort joy, as you'll be restarting many times. It took me good ~30 groups to find someone to finish the game with. Thankfully (and sadly) first act is the best made one, and there's a lot to do there.   Main reason why I would recommend this game is not it's story, or some innovative features and approaches, but it's replayability. Even 300+ hours in I found combat enjoyable, each fight a challenge, with a chance to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up. There are some rather clever mechanics to learn and abuse, unique skills to master, builds to optimize and routes to find.   The game is well worth your money and time, despite it's shortcomings.   Speaking of which... Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of things wrong with the game. From expected (but not liked) bugs and glitches - on my last playthrough we had at least 3 bugged quests, a bunch of issues with stuck characters and desyncs - to more serious problems.   Story is passable at best. It will not keep you awake or amaze you in the end. Sidequests are often more engaging than the main plot line.   Armor system is very restricting for the most of the game, especially on the higher difficulties. It pretty much forces you in to using only physical or magical (typically physical) damage, as you need to strip the armor before controls can be used, and controls are mandatory for the most of the game. Yes, sure eventually you can get one spell room clearing mages, but that's late game, and that's not what you will be doing most of the time. Arguably mages are gimped up to level 12, which is a good half of the game. Once again, this is highest difficulty level, but this is where it gets fun.   There is also serious lack of skills, or variety, to be precise. It's fine for first game, but later you start to notice it more. And so many skills are very situational, or subpar, so you generally use ~5 constantly and a few for utility. It's specially notable between melee classes, as a rogue, knight(2h weapons), warrior(sword and board) and metamorph will use the same warfare skills, as they are core to being a melee, and not their ""subclass"" variations. There are also crafted skills, combining 2 schools, but combinations are between magical and physical schools, meaning you will rarely even see them.   There is very little to do outside of combat, except preparing for combat or picking up quests before you go fight stuff for the quests. A bit lacking from a cRPG.   Several of the systems feel unfinished, lacking purpose. Crafting seems like a huge part of the game initially, but you only really craft runes and lockpicks. Potions, scrolls, food and grenades quickly become useless, even healing potions are disappointing in the endgame. Scrolls hold up the longest, but not the offensive one, only the ones that can remove status effects. NPC attitude value is a glorified discount program.   AI ""cheats"" a lot. No one will suspect you as an undead (or having the zombie trait) outside of combat, but once initiated, get ready to receive all the healing spells. And they will forget it immediately after. Enemies will know where exactly to move, to avoid a minefield of line of sigh obstacles and smoke blockers, just to get that single possible shot on their turn.   But all of that said, I still enjoyed the hell out of my time with the game. Sure, maybe the abysmal state of PC gaming this year and lack of good RPG games in general is partially to blame, but I think there's more to it.  I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for a game they can immerse themselves in."

Maev,181,5,0,"May 1, 2017",Recommended,116.2,"Although the difficulty is extremly high, a bit to high for release i like it. Some fight take multiple attempts and really cheesy tactics like deploying rogue in the back of a boss with all buffs and then initiating the fight :D Also you have the next lvl of making advantage of elements, especially of your blessing skill which seems the most important one in the game, eg. fire which can transform fire into holy fire.  The graphics are INSANE like every log on a bridge is placed separately.  So all in all the difficulty is a no go for the description ""Story Mode"" since the last fights are ridicolously hard but i absolutely recommend this game after release :O"

GeneralPing,189,5,0,"September 23, 2016",Recommended,25.1,"Divinity: Original Sin 2  If you are wondering whether or not to buy this at alpha please read  Pros: - The game is very polished for an alpha, more so than the completed Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition - There is up to 4 - player co-op which is magnificent - More interactions between characters with, arguably, a more riveting story-line (Only chapter 1 thus far) - Combat is more easy to follow, movements cost less AP and it is all around improved on - More customization options when compared to the original  - Multiple ways to complete tasks, it really feels like Larian Studios wants you to discover your own way to solve problems - Even for an Alpha Divinity: Original Sin 2 is better then most games out today  Cons:  - Lack of in-game voice chat makes playing with random people difficult as it usually devolves into murdering the entire town - It's still in Alpha, buy the game, support the creators! - If you don't know what to do or lose direction you may get bored, similar to the original, pay attention and read everything  Overall I'd say that Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a big step up from the first. Graphically it's superior, it runs better, the combat is improved, the story is more engaging, players get to interact more, and much much more to come in the future when the game is fully released. That and this is a pseudo - follow up to the original game. So if you played the original then you will most definitely enjoy the tid bits of information and story in the second!"
Lavo,341,5,0,"October 11, 2016",Recommended,216.9,"After some time, I'm finally able to give my final thoughts.   Graphics: Animations and effects feels and looks smooth and polished. I love how the water and fire looks in this game. During co-op play with a friend of mine there were couple graphical bugs or glitches, but nothing major.  Characters: You can choose to play one of the six origin character, each with they own story or you can create your own custom character. Some NPCs may recognize your origin character as an old friend or someone they are hired to murder. This helps flesh out each origin character and it really makes you think how some encounters would have went with different character.  Combat: Characters can use all kinds of spells, skills or items to get out of tricky situation. Turn-based combat gives player(s) plenty of time to look around and make best use of their surroundings. Electrify water puddle (or create one if there is none) to stun enemies or freeze it to make them slip and knock themselves out. What I'm missing from Divinity: Original Sin is smoke cloud to block visibility from enemy rangers.   Also one major difference between Divinity: Original Sin and Divinity: Original Sin 2 combat is how to block / resist status conditions like fear, stunned etc. Instead of investing points to certain ability to increase your chance to resist getting stunned, in Divinity: Original Sin 2 you have physical and magical armor values, which block status conditions as long as corresponding armor value is higher than zero. I think this is a nice improvement.  Music and sound: Voice acted characters (player and npc) sounds great and hearing they saying their lines makes conversations feel lively. Sound of nature such as walking on sand, water or fire sounds life like and real. Add great music and you have one potion of eargasm. Love it!  Overall, I highly recommend any RPG fan to get this game or Divinity: Original Sin (Enhanced Edition) or maybe both."

However I must say this game has exceded all my expectations, and they were quite high to be honest.   Pros: - Fully customizable characters: stats, talents, skills, equipment... you can play whatever personalized hero you can think of. - Great graphics: it may not be high-end graphics, but are pretty good and would make the game playable in ultra spec in any computer - Deep story: I have only put 18 hours to the game and I haven't yet advanced outside the starting area. So many characters, so many stories and so many places to explore - Open world: go wherever you want, the game guides you in a very slight way allowing you to wander around as you may please - Decissions matter: every dialoge option will have an impact on the outcome of the conversation and the story. Every character has unique dialogue options with the same character, making the game deeper and more realistic.  - Turn-based Combat mechanics focused on tactics over clicking like nuts - Great soundtrack - Deep crafting mechanics - 360¬∫ camera + tactical view mode (top down)  Cons:  - Can be hard to get into. Lacks some more explanation of the mechanics at the beginning - If you missclick a talent or skill point you cannot take it back - Sometimes sound gets a bit laggy  For me this game is a must have. 10/10"

Not hitting the boss hard enough? Summon a giant spider made of skeletons. It hits plenty hard.  Is the boss hitting too hard? Turn the boss into a chicken.

Now before you say it was not perfect, let me say there is no such thing as perfection, we seek it and hopefully never find it. DOA was brilliant and that is a fact, not an opinion.  DOA2 well its ""more of the same"", and I know when people usually say that it is followed by a sigh and resignation and usually ""Uh"".  However not in the case of DOA2 it does all the DOA tick boxes but adds more, and I mean more in a very good way.  An example is when you start out in DOA2 you will find that crafting plays an important part of getting better equipment to survive.  There are even more ways to complete quests and some ways you can avoid quests, for example there are various ways to leave and some require a clever tongue others brute force or stealth and so much more.  The character backgrounds are an interesting and tease you with a more interesting and some quite meaningful motivation for escape and progression.  If this opening chapter is anything to go by then all I can say is ""more of the same"", YES PLEASE!...So put it on your wishlist or buy it."

My original thought's going into this game was that it would be the same as every other, with progression gradually getting easier until I reach the point that I would have no problem killing everything, but no matter how hard I tried I constantly had to redo some of the fights, to really learn the tactics and how the game works. The game exceeded my expectations by far and I would definetly recommed this game to any fan of dungeons and dragons, especially with the new game master feature comming out soon, this could very well revolutionise D&D as we know it."

None but D:OS2. The length of this Early Access is easily around 10 - 12 hours of gameplay if you just started to play.  NOTE: If you don't like reading through text-heavy dialogues, this game isn't for you, as the game assumed you understand and read what the NPC said to you to finish the quests.

Blackadar,366,6,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,115.9,"Almost copy/paste of the original DoS2 review, this has been updated for the new edition.  I could just about copy and paste my D:OS review for D:OS 2. The short versions is that if you liked D:OS you'll like 2. If you didn't enjoy the first you won't like the second. So if you have experience with the first title, there's your answer. You can stop reading now. The rest of this review is aimed at those who haven't played the first game.  I thought the first was a GOTY contender in 2014 and I think #2 is a GOTY contender in 2017. But it's going to get tougher to keep recommeding this series when the same bugs and flaws keep showing up. So let's start with those flaws.  1. The obscure quests still remain from the original and you often have no idea how to move a quest forward or where to go next. The quest log is still quite useless. Some quests are quite obscure looking for objects that you may have uncovered (or not) including at least one with an object from a prior area. 2. Some screens are too much of a pixel hunt and the highlight button doesn't highlight most objects.  3. The difficulty curve is, frankly, stupid. Larian still needs to tone down the difficulty on lower difficulty levels and smooth the curve. You will likely hit problems in the low teens and then the endgame battles are stupid difficult. 4,. BUGS. Larian still can't test out bugs for‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• For instance, I finally won the final battle...only to have the game keep me in combat meaning I had to do the whole frickin' thing all over again. I finally got through it again and the voice-over proceeded to give me the wrong ending. DAMN IT LARIAN, YOU HAD ONE JOB!  Now on to the good stuff.  Like the first game, this game has the best turn-based combat ever to appear in a RPG. This is the meat of the game and it's sooooo tasty. There are many options on how to approach a battle, so many builds and so many tactics that it's impossible to even scrape the surface in a review. Literally no other RPG gives you this kind of build and combat flexibility.  Every encounter is a combat puzzle and most of them are fun. Sometimes an encounter seems impossible and then you figure out a strategy to make it relatively easy. This series remains the high-water mark of RPG combat and you could play it many times with many different builds because they play so differently. The AI is quite good to the point of being frustrating. You can - and will - get stun locked in certain battles (frustrating!). As I said, this is the core of the game.   The rest of the game is good too, even if it doesn't quite measure up to the combat excellence. The back stories of the starting characters are great and your party members seem to be far more developed this time. The voice acting has been consistently great and the music and sounds are still top-notch. The environments are quite beautiful and quite detailed though they are sometimes so busy the game delves into a pixel hunt. The races are really quite neat and there's a couple here that are fairly original which isn't easy to do in an RPG. The RPG aspects just feel more fully fleshed out in this version. The synergy between the NPCs doesn't seem to be very good to start but after a few rough bumps the first two levels it's easier to figure out how you want to blend your party. Truthfully, I haven't seen much in the Dev Cut that I didn't recall from the original but I'm sure there's some new stuff.  DoS2 is a step forward from the original and both are excellent games. Recommended for any RPG fan."

Kozzy - Red Dead Redemption 2!,587,15,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,194.8,"Divinity Original Sin 1 was good, but Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of the best rpg's of not only this year, or of this generation, but of all time. The writing is a huge improvement, the voice acting is brilliant and the strategic combat is even better than before. The game is a blast solo or with a friend, tons of customization and many ways to go about doing missions. So many cool skills to play with it is amazing!  I have not been this addicted to a modern roleplaying game since Fallout New Vegas or The Witcher 3 (Sure I loved Divinity Original Sin 1, Dragon Age origins, Pillars Of Eternity,etc.. but these are on another level for me personally). Every aspect shines in this game and my biggest complaints are improved this go around. Larian deserves a ton of respect and love for making such a great, epic roleplaying game. This game has a ton of replay value and will played for many more hours for me.   Games of this quality don't come out that often, go support Larian and buy this wonderful game, get ready for some wonderful adventures! Hands down GOTY for me in 2017. I enjoyed alot of games this year but nothing game close to the total package Divinity Original Sin 2 offers. If you enjoyed Divinity original Sin 1, pick this up ASAP.  If you didn't like Original Sin 1, there is still a good chance you will fall in love with the sequel, as everything is improved.  Well done Larian, well done!  **Over 170 hours later, what a game! Not only one of the best rpgs of modern times but also ever. Just a real joy to play and you can tell the developers put a ton of effort into this game. Other rpg devs take notes! The game has the best turnbased combat, much improved writing, wonderful world design, tons of fun quests, it is very challenging (Dark Souls who?) and gorgeous art design. While it is great when playing solo, this game has some of the best coop with a friend (or a few) that I have ever witnessed, not just in rpgs but any genre, grab a friend and get ready for a really amazing ride. This is a perfect example for how to turn a good game's sequel into a much improved (in nearly every aspect) masterpiece**  **The Definitve Edition has come out and it is fantastic, what a wonderful job Larian does at giving us a free enhanced edition a year later. Last years GOTY just got better, somehow! I can't wait to see what Larian does next, they have been on fire lately!**"

I'm about 38 hours in and oh my god im so happy i purchased it. There is so much gameplay, quests, goofs, amazingness, etc.   It truely makes me want to do every single quest and I get sad if I miss anything. The companions are great I personally have hydro mage, rouge awesomeness elf, and handsome hunter. I also want to completere their own stories because its just so interesting to experience.   The fact that most people hate me cause I'm a lizard is cool because the story rotates on what race you are as well. I might even make a second character just to see the reactions and how playing with different companions play out.

Easily over 100 hours of adventure & exploring. Superfun and hard tactical turn-base combat that will force you to think about every move you make (every step you take, every bond you break.....you get it).  xD  The game can seem a bit unfair at certain boss fights and puzzles but you will get that DarkSouls feeling when you finally defeat them/solve them.  The freedom given in this game is beyond understaning how it's even working without being broken. (Not that it's not without bugs, but nothing to worry about too much)   There's just so MANY ways to complete a certain quests, so many MANY ways to play a class, sooo MAAAAANY spell combos and so many ways to play the game itself, it just offers a great amount of replayability and countless hours of fun.  I almost gave it a perfect score, but for some technical issues (f-ing necro fire lagging on a GTX 1080Ti!) and unnecessary difficult spikes I took one point out.   Final Verdict is 9/10  You can talk to every single NPC in the game. And every single one of them is voice acted! WUT"

In this game you have: Marvelous Graphics An interesting and Compelling story Quality side content A combat system that rivals or surpasses XCOM Interesting characters that have actual story arcs and personality Beautiful Environments and an astonishing amount of content.  The only problem I've had thus far is that it feels like side content is almost required to stay properly leveled so you don't get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed when you go to an area you are a tiny bit underleveled for.

Rumbeef,"1,115",4,0,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,175.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game that had me constantly feeling as though I was getting to the point that I was powerful, and then they threw a curveball at me.  It kept me exploring and eating at the edges of quests that I would have to return to later when I was more experienced.  Throughout the game I came up to walls that I had to search for ways around or over, it seemed like the game was always ready for me.  It felt rewarding to figure out something, to get past an enemy who had stopped me before, to try something different with my skills and abilities.    I hadn‚Äôt played any Divinity games before and they had a good way of bringing me into the world they‚Äôve crafted, individual party members had interesting motives and I felt like our interactions were dependant on my input.  The story had a good thread pulling me towards the conclusion of the game and kept me wondering where it was taking me.    I like turn based combat because it usually feels like I‚Äôm responsible for what happens throughout combat, and Divinity has a few ways to have unexpected actions unravel your plans.  The elemental system worked well for this, combining a few different spells could make a whole area a minefield, or clear it by using alternatives.  I didn‚Äôt utilize all the systems, other than a few items I never had to touch crafting and rarely used potions.  The items and loot were enough to have an impact on my builds and I was usually able to get gear I wanted from either quests or vendors.  There are enough abilities and types of play that I could see a second or third run being very different than how I played through the first time.  I only played a little multiplayer, but I enjoyed how we were able to work together to rob and murder people, something I can never bring myself to do when I play solo.  I think they found a good balance around doing turn based rpg combat with multiple people, if one person gets into a fight while their buddy is somewhere else, the buddy can regroup and join into already active combat.  That also works in the single player game as well, I often would start a conversation with an enemy and before combat started I‚Äôd organize my squad and summon a demon for backup.   I got completely addicted to this game when I picked it up, I was impressed by it the whole way through."

It's easy to get lost if you're not focused on progressing early on, but the middle and ending of the game hit the perfect balance between exploring a rich, interesting environment, and a desperate race to save the world.   the finest and most captivating story i've ever had the joy of experiencing. coming from the lengendary writers of Falluot: NV, and KOTOR 2, expect a breathtaking journey with twists, turns, mysteries, and shocking reveals that few games have ever come close to.  bring one friend your first time thorugh  absolutely phenomenal from start to finish, and worth re-playing all over again just to see more."

That being said, my ONE playthrough...took me 195 hours...and I loved every damn 11,700 minutes of it. I got the game less than a week ago.   There is so much I haven't done, so much that I intend to do in my next playthrough with friends. I also haven't tried any mods, the game is apparently as close to open source as you can get and it's super moddable.   There are full dialogue options, numerous perspectives and angles to take. You can do so much in this game and it's filled with so much content, honestly puts many many games to shame...‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•drenched shame.   My experience was as ""Malcador"" the undead necromancer polymorph battlemage who somehow also managed to keep people alive with minor side effects. I walked upon the sands to meet my companions, whom I would never part with. Beast, Red Prince, Ifan. We fought monsters, found our callings, and had kickass adventures.   In my darkest hour, with only myself remaining and surrounded by vicious enemies...I looked into my inventory and saw salvation...""Death Fog Barrel"" In that moment I knew what I had to do, I dropped the barrel and hit it hard, everything arround me was dead and there was much rejoicing. And that is how I defeated the chicken warriors of karrakdo'.  I cannot say anything to do the game justice, the only thing I can come close to is that this game has EARNED its right to be called the Game of the Year.  I'd go as far as to say that it deserves game of the decade."
Lazarus,238,4,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,253.3,"27 hours in the game and I haven't even left Fort Joy. Literally... I haven't broken out. I convinced my best friend to join me and we have been hacking away at anything and anyone who seemed like a bad guy. Breaking the game mechanics is legitamately half the fun here. We managed to sneak our way past Magisters by using the teleport spell. Somehow... we always managed to take the back door into every dungeon.   We couldn't stop getting ourselves in trouble at every turn. By the way, getting into trouble is just part of the fun. Speaking of which, be ready to quick save a ton. The developers were kind enough to give 5 quick save slots along with auto saves and unlimited hard saves... Unless you're playing on that insane 4th difficulty, in which you have just the 1 save and a total party kill is very very bad. You basically get your save erased on the hardest difficulty if everyone dies.   Pros: -Break the game dammit. Just do it! I swear finding ways to navigate and utterly cheese your way around a level is amazing. We saved a paladin just by teleporting everyone up to the second floor of the castle, then knock down the ladder, and then sneak to the front door... only to get prepared for a massive fight just before the doors swing open and  a Knight and Battle Mage just flat out turn into hulking battering rams that decimate the first guy they see. The amount of planning that you can make for a battle is amazing... I even got a chance to set up environmental hazards for the enemies by moving poison barrels and oil barrels ahead of a fight.   -The sneaking system is hilarious, but well maintained. Seeing a lizard tail poke out from under a barrel makes me giggle. The enemy vision scales down with higher thievery skills.  -The turn based fighting system is the best I have seen yet. It really feels like a ton of heart and effort has gone into this portion of the game. You need to see it to understand just how much it is like a legitamate DnD pen and paper style turn based system. It brings that niche genre to an immediate resurrection and breathes new life into it. Trust me, if you get this game for any reason, and you like turn based strategy, this is the very reason to get giddy like a damn school girl. The battle system alone is a game changer and was an insta buy for me and my friend.  -Choices, choices, choices. Choose wisely or shoot yourself in the foot... or shoot your friend in the foot... or shoot that annoying cat and feed it to the elf. I'm not joking, that cat is in the way all the time. I can't go 5 seconds without accidently lighting it on fire. The dialogue system is very well done and the choices you make will certainly matter. You can miss massive side quests that actually are very important to the overall story and your well being. Other mission and quests are just there to get your butt into a ton of trouble just because you said ""what's the worst that could happen?"". Everything... Just be careful with your choices. You may also live with any and every choice you make. Bad decisions can follow you and from the looks of it, can have consequences on the quests that get closed off because someone had a bad attitude with you or they got shanked unsuspectedly when you were looking the other direction. However, even bad decisions seem to lead down some interesting paths.   -Dialogue is absolutely amazing. Every character and NPC I have met so far is voiced and has a good feeling to their emotions. They always feel genuine, so far. I have yet to meet an NPC that had seemed overly annoying or out of place. The voice actors have done a really good job. My favorite part is the narrator, who has a soothing englishman's accent and doesn't feel snobby. Once again, props to the voice actors.  Neutral: -Have yet to experience the Game Master mode, yet the tutorial makes it out to be a true Dungeon Master style with 4 players under the control of the DM. You can make full campaigns and there are a literal sh*t ton of options. Just look up Game Master Tutorial on YouTube, which was made by the devs, and you'll see what I mean.  -If you don't pick one of the Main Characters, you may be missing out on massive parts of the story. Do not worry. If you create a custom character, you still have the option of taking 3 of the main characters along in your quests. Each main character has their own story and ambitions. Be sure to pay attention to them as they may lead you down some very interesting paths.  Cons: -I am legit am coming up short for things I do not like. There were some minor bugs when the game first released, but the devs seem to have a fast response time and are working diligently on most of the problems we were experiencing. In fact, most of the major issues disappeared on the first week. Sooooo... these are not the cons you are looking for..."

Rumbeef,"1,115",4,0,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,175.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is the kind of game that had me constantly feeling as though I was getting to the point that I was powerful, and then they threw a curveball at me.  It kept me exploring and eating at the edges of quests that I would have to return to later when I was more experienced.  Throughout the game I came up to walls that I had to search for ways around or over, it seemed like the game was always ready for me.  It felt rewarding to figure out something, to get past an enemy who had stopped me before, to try something different with my skills and abilities.    I hadn‚Äôt played any Divinity games before and they had a good way of bringing me into the world they‚Äôve crafted, individual party members had interesting motives and I felt like our interactions were dependant on my input.  The story had a good thread pulling me towards the conclusion of the game and kept me wondering where it was taking me.    I like turn based combat because it usually feels like I‚Äôm responsible for what happens throughout combat, and Divinity has a few ways to have unexpected actions unravel your plans.  The elemental system worked well for this, combining a few different spells could make a whole area a minefield, or clear it by using alternatives.  I didn‚Äôt utilize all the systems, other than a few items I never had to touch crafting and rarely used potions.  The items and loot were enough to have an impact on my builds and I was usually able to get gear I wanted from either quests or vendors.  There are enough abilities and types of play that I could see a second or third run being very different than how I played through the first time.  I only played a little multiplayer, but I enjoyed how we were able to work together to rob and murder people, something I can never bring myself to do when I play solo.  I think they found a good balance around doing turn based rpg combat with multiple people, if one person gets into a fight while their buddy is somewhere else, the buddy can regroup and join into already active combat.  That also works in the single player game as well, I often would start a conversation with an enemy and before combat started I‚Äôd organize my squad and summon a demon for backup.   I got completely addicted to this game when I picked it up, I was impressed by it the whole way through."

nikout13,565,4,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,164.2,"Sorcery, chivalry, pyromancy, rogues, necromancers and lizards are here and is all you need to embrace the world of Divinity in its second game of Original Sin! Many places to explore, many people to persue and many 'ventures to subdue. One of the most epic experiences so far delivered in a fantasy world, giving us more control on builds to make - be anything you want! Combine your summoning skills with your tanking approaches, making yourself a strong opponent to those who dare to face you. Many quests to complete; each one of them has a good start and its up to you entirely how you would like the result to be. Turn based combat mechanics, along with some events that occur during the fight turn tides for both of sides, watch for a third invader! A bit of a rushed character development at the start, but you will get the gist of each easily the more you interact with them, all of them provide many benefits and great moments to witness your character engaging. Play with friends, play in-character during dialogues that can make the options wider in terms of gameplay and character benefits.   One of the best RPG games I have played in a long time that keeps me sunk in for hours even days now! coming from a guy doing a singleplayer, it is astonishingly entertaining, and the encounters are very memorable. Give it some love, look at what you'd like!"

They have removed a lot of the fluff from the first game that weren't bad but at times just felt unecessary; made it more straightforward without sacrificing depth. If you liked the first game, chances are you will love this one. Only the first act is available but it's already looking very promising. The game improves on the first game on just about every level, and the new origin-specific dialogs and options make replayability and variety high."
AstroBoltos ‚ú¶,135,4,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,287.2,"One of the most immersive RPG's I have ever played, although it's only a part of Act I the world in Divinity feels ro rich in life and lore. Playing classic mode is just about right in terms of difficulty the turn based combat makes it super complex, it's both easy to understand but  hard to master. Combat is super tactical you will find yourself struggling to keep your party at bay fighting hordes of enemies. The enemy A.I. feels natural as if you where actually facing a big threat in the dungeons, but it balances out with how good you level up and build your party. There's a bunch of stuff you can do while in combat such as positioning and combining different elements to your advantage but it's still very fun and doesnt feel repetitive. The crafting gets a little confusing, dont know if it's because I haven't found many recipes but through combining you pretty much go blindly into it and expect to get soom goodies such as consumables and learn the recipe.  The decision making in this game is pretty much a big deal, since it signifcantly affects the people you interact with and the outcome of any conversation related to your actions or thoughts. For an early access game its 10 times better than any mediocre regurgitated unpolished garbage on steam.  The Core gameplay will be fighting and looting corpses to get stronger, but you will find yourself with a lot of quests from various NPC'S and sub-story lines. Although I felt a little insecure with how quests didnt show any markers on the map or minimap it is very immersive that while chatting with NPC'S they can pin point a location of interest in the quest if the person you're talking to actually knows about it, instead of just telling you to do something and you as a player just feel like you are going through rails while discovering quests.   The amount of time I spent reading and nitpicking through my journal and conversations was just about right, not too confusing but not too easy, the game really does a great job at treating you as a competent player. While its easy to get lost on objectives and questlines you can always go back to the conversations you've had with your journal. The Soundtrack is Amazing you wont even feel it bothering you when jogging or fighting through the maps various and diverse locations.   Overall I said everything I had to although, I had encountered various bugs but nothing a good checkpoint cant fix and I cannot wait for the full realease. A very good experience for a fan of the genre. I think most people should have a fun time, but its far better when playing with your friends and having a blast. Interactivity with the world and the attention to detail that Larian studios has made is superb, trully a nice gem to be found. I strongly recommend you get this game if you are into gaming in general."

Claivain,196,4,0,"May 16, 2017",Recommended,599.9,":Early access Alpha review. At the time of writing only the first chapter is available:  Original Sin 2 improves upon every element of the first installment. There are more disciplines (and therefore more powers and skills). The environment reacts to elemental powers in more complex and interesting ways, leading to more tactical options. The new art style is a great improvement for the character models (personal opinion possibly). The combat is still solid, and the writing is still engaging.   All in all, if you enjoyed the first iteration of Original Sin, then I imagine you'll love this one too. My only gripe is that local multiplayer has been removed, and online is the only option if you want to play with friends. While this may not be a massive issue for some people, I played through the first version using couch co op with my wife, and I'd have liked to do the same again with this one, however it is not possible. I'm not sure whether it's a planned feature for the full release or not, so maybe it'll be added in the future.   All in all, fully recommended."

Be sure to pay attention to them as they may lead you down some very interesting paths.  Cons: -I am legit am coming up short for things I do not like. There were some minor bugs when the game first released, but the devs seem to have a fast response time and are working diligently on most of the problems we were experiencing. In fact, most of the major issues disappeared on the first week. Sooooo... these are not the cons you are looking for..."
[AEON]Lockerd,565,4,1,"December 18, 2017",Recommended,196.8,"Ok, I wanted to do one playthrough before giving my opinion on the game.   That being said, my ONE playthrough...took me 195 hours...and I loved every damn 11,700 minutes of it. I got the game less than a week ago.   There is so much I haven't done, so much that I intend to do in my next playthrough with friends. I also haven't tried any mods, the game is apparently as close to open source as you can get and it's super moddable.   There are full dialogue options, numerous perspectives and angles to take. You can do so much in this game and it's filled with so much content, honestly puts many many games to shame...‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•drenched shame.   My experience was as ""Malcador"" the undead necromancer polymorph battlemage who somehow also managed to keep people alive with minor side effects. I walked upon the sands to meet my companions, whom I would never part with. Beast, Red Prince, Ifan. We fought monsters, found our callings, and had kickass adventures.   In my darkest hour, with only myself remaining and surrounded by vicious enemies...I looked into my inventory and saw salvation...""Death Fog Barrel"" In that moment I knew what I had to do, I dropped the barrel and hit it hard, everything arround me was dead and there was much rejoicing. And that is how I defeated the chicken warriors of karrakdo'.  I cannot say anything to do the game justice, the only thing I can come close to is that this game has EARNED its right to be called the Game of the Year.  I'd go as far as to say that it deserves game of the decade."

Claivain,196,4,0,"May 16, 2017",Recommended,599.9,":Early access Alpha review. At the time of writing only the first chapter is available:  Original Sin 2 improves upon every element of the first installment. There are more disciplines (and therefore more powers and skills). The environment reacts to elemental powers in more complex and interesting ways, leading to more tactical options. The new art style is a great improvement for the character models (personal opinion possibly). The combat is still solid, and the writing is still engaging.   All in all, if you enjoyed the first iteration of Original Sin, then I imagine you'll love this one too. My only gripe is that local multiplayer has been removed, and online is the only option if you want to play with friends. While this may not be a massive issue for some people, I played through the first version using couch co op with my wife, and I'd have liked to do the same again with this one, however it is not possible. I'm not sure whether it's a planned feature for the full release or not, so maybe it'll be added in the future.   All in all, fully recommended."
LMW-YBC,137,4,1,January 20,Recommended,126.8,"I bought this game knowing nothing about the franchise or of its background. My friends wanted to play it as it had co-op and looked pretty nice from the screenshots we had, so we all picked it up and gave it a go. 50 hours later, we eventually managed to finish our first playthrough, and what I came out with is one of the most enjoyable game experiences I have ever had, and without a shadow of a doubt my game of the year for 2017.  First of all, I did not expect the writing or voice-acting to be as good as it is. There is a lot of genuinely captivating moments the game has and a good amount of decisions you can make, either as an individual or as a party. You really do feel like you are on this grand adventure, and you essentially make your own story (even if you play as one of the origin characters) which is awesome.  Now, I think I need to get onto what is the most amazing part of this game: the gameplay. On the surface it seems quite simple, and it isn't exactly difficult as you have plenty of time to make decisions and your abilities clearly show what you can and cannot do in your current position. But if you take the time to experiment with things, you can discover new things that can entirely change the way you battle. Elements can combine to create strong new effects, objects and characters can be blessed to create entirely different effects based on their surroundings, combining abilities can create fantastic (and sometimes even hilarious) opportunities for your party, and so on. You are actively encouraged to try out new things, which is something I rarely see games do now.  The diversity of abilities is also a huge plus. There are a bunch of skill paths you can choose from, each having their own unique abilities. You can focus on having a bit of everything, or you can focus on a couple of paths, but whatever you do you will be able to make it work as with many paths you have a lot of capabilities to control the battle, and with less paths your abilities will be much stronger and capable of dealing a lot of damage. Finding a mix-and-match of what works for your team best is part of the fun, you can even change your stats entirely at a certain point so you can change if you feel your current ones aren't working.  I think it's no surprise, but the game is damn pretty. Even for a top-down game the level of detail in the world is astounding, and the art style really appeals to me. It never stays the same either, as you explore you will find new areas that have an entirely different look and feel to the last place, usually accomodated by new enemy types as well. I love the different races and how they look, as well as how differently they are represented in the game's society. It's an exceptionally well-made fantasy world that still manages to be believable.  Such a great game, if you are even remotely into RPGs I would say give this one a go. It's best played with friends for sure, although playing solo is fine, too."

Considering the game still has some minor bugs, its only getting better! These bugs do not stop me from fully enjoying this amazing game.  Story is rich and well voiced over, combat is fun and Imo pretty challenging. There  are alot of secrets  to be found, walking in town talking to every single one does reward!  Its like a interactive movie, totally worth the money. other companies can learn from this ( asking 60 bucks by default lol) currently ive got 65 hours into it and the end is FAR from near, and can't wait to do another playthrough & co-op with friends.

AstroBoltos ‚ú¶,135,4,0,"September 11, 2017",Recommended,287.2,"One of the most immersive RPG's I have ever played, although it's only a part of Act I the world in Divinity feels ro rich in life and lore. Playing classic mode is just about right in terms of difficulty the turn based combat makes it super complex, it's both easy to understand but  hard to master. Combat is super tactical you will find yourself struggling to keep your party at bay fighting hordes of enemies. The enemy A.I. feels natural as if you where actually facing a big threat in the dungeons, but it balances out with how good you level up and build your party. There's a bunch of stuff you can do while in combat such as positioning and combining different elements to your advantage but it's still very fun and doesnt feel repetitive. The crafting gets a little confusing, dont know if it's because I haven't found many recipes but through combining you pretty much go blindly into it and expect to get soom goodies such as consumables and learn the recipe.  The decision making in this game is pretty much a big deal, since it signifcantly affects the people you interact with and the outcome of any conversation related to your actions or thoughts. For an early access game its 10 times better than any mediocre regurgitated unpolished garbage on steam.  The Core gameplay will be fighting and looting corpses to get stronger, but you will find yourself with a lot of quests from various NPC'S and sub-story lines. Although I felt a little insecure with how quests didnt show any markers on the map or minimap it is very immersive that while chatting with NPC'S they can pin point a location of interest in the quest if the person you're talking to actually knows about it, instead of just telling you to do something and you as a player just feel like you are going through rails while discovering quests.   The amount of time I spent reading and nitpicking through my journal and conversations was just about right, not too confusing but not too easy, the game really does a great job at treating you as a competent player. While its easy to get lost on objectives and questlines you can always go back to the conversations you've had with your journal. The Soundtrack is Amazing you wont even feel it bothering you when jogging or fighting through the maps various and diverse locations.   Overall I said everything I had to although, I had encountered various bugs but nothing a good checkpoint cant fix and I cannot wait for the full realease. A very good experience for a fan of the genre. I think most people should have a fun time, but its far better when playing with your friends and having a blast. Interactivity with the world and the attention to detail that Larian studios has made is superb, trully a nice gem to be found. I strongly recommend you get this game if you are into gaming in general."
nikout13,565,4,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,164.2,"Sorcery, chivalry, pyromancy, rogues, necromancers and lizards are here and is all you need to embrace the world of Divinity in its second game of Original Sin! Many places to explore, many people to persue and many 'ventures to subdue. One of the most epic experiences so far delivered in a fantasy world, giving us more control on builds to make - be anything you want! Combine your summoning skills with your tanking approaches, making yourself a strong opponent to those who dare to face you. Many quests to complete; each one of them has a good start and its up to you entirely how you would like the result to be. Turn based combat mechanics, along with some events that occur during the fight turn tides for both of sides, watch for a third invader! A bit of a rushed character development at the start, but you will get the gist of each easily the more you interact with them, all of them provide many benefits and great moments to witness your character engaging. Play with friends, play in-character during dialogues that can make the options wider in terms of gameplay and character benefits.   One of the best RPG games I have played in a long time that keeps me sunk in for hours even days now! coming from a guy doing a singleplayer, it is astonishingly entertaining, and the encounters are very memorable. Give it some love, look at what you'd like!"

PacManPolarBear,396,4,0,"October 16, 2017",Recommended,142.7,"The realm of Rivellon feels vibrant and alive. At times sunny and cheerful, with delightfully lighthearted moments, but also deeply disturbing and dark, unafraid of having players face things that can only be described as nightmare fuel. One minute you are talking to a happy bear about honey and the next you are running for your life from a giant spider that wants to feed you to its babies. The balance between those two, the light and the dark, is spot on. The storylines are wonderful and interesting, with tons of variety. Side quests don‚Äôt feel like filler content which is a big plus for a game as large and full of things to do as Divinity: Original Sin 2 is.   It's one of the best looking isometric RPG‚Äôs ever made. Each of the games four major areas are exquisitely detailed and beautiful in their own unique way. Characters have subtle animations and visual flourishes that really make them stand out. The colour pallet is vibrant, gorgeous and bright with striking blue, green, red and yellow colours. The game does makes sure to contrast that with deep blacks, subtle grays and dark reds when fighting in the darker, more evil infested areas. Everything is visually interesting.  The soundtrack is wonderful. Joyous and fun one moment, tense and foreboding the next. None of the music feels repetitive or overstays its welcome. The sinister transition music that rings out when you enter truly dangerous areas still makes a shiver run up my spine every time I hear it. The fact that every line of dialogue in the game is voice acted is impressive and almost always of impeccable quality. It really helps sells the games more emotional moments.  The turn based combat in Divinity: Original Sin 2 is all about interconnected systems. Fire ignites poison clouds or oil slicks. Rain puts out fire while ice can trip up enemies and allies alike. Necromancy can raise the dead or curse the living but can be countered by healing magic. Everything has a counterpoint of some type and a well coordinated exchange can take advantage of any number of systems to powerful effect. Unlike D&D games where your characters live or die by a lucky or unlucky roll of the dice, Divinity: Original Sin 2 does not make players worship at the alter of the RNG (random number generation) gods quite so much.  The longer you play the more complex the combat interactions. By the time you reach the mid to late game the list of abilities and spells at your disposal is vast. Even though each character chooses a class at the beginning of the game you can place points into whatever skill trees and abilities you want. The game encourages experimentation and since you can respec as much as you want once you leave the games first area there is nothing to stop you from making a character that is exactly what you want it to be.  The early game leans a bit too heavily on basic elemental exchanges like fire and ice, but eventually you‚Äôll spend just as much time raising the dead, summoning demons, blinding your foes or charming people as you will tossing fireballs and ice shards. Because you have so many options when it comes to combat a lot of players have found ways to cheese the system. Some interactions were things the developers intended, but others are clearly breaking the game in ways they never considered. Patches post launch have addressed some of these issues, such as inflicting bleeding damage on an enemy and then transforming them into a chicken that runs itself to death. Or infinite damage loops that result from the interplay between buffs and attacks. That said the game encourages players to find innovative ways to tackle major obstacles. My personal favorite tactic it using teleport to push a tough enemy into the path of another powerful NPC and watch them tear each other to pieces.  Even with the ability to cheese the system at times and the plethora of options at your disposal, playing Divinity: Original Sin 2 on anything above Explorer difficulty can be really, really tough. Especially your first 10 hours with the game as you learn the intricacies of its many systems and options. The AI is smart and deadly and will throw every trick in the book at you. I restarted my campaign a half dozen times and invested almost 20 hours before I found a party composition and set of builds I felt complemented the way I wanted to play the game.  The game features a robust crafting system. Dozens of spells, potions, meals, enchantments and items can be crafted. You can learn recipes from books or experiment on your own to learn new ones. The one area where crafting falls short is weapons and armour.  Freedom and experimentation is at the very heart of what makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing. It applies not only to combat but how you tackle the games many quests and challenges. Almost everything has multiple avenues of approach and a myriad of solutions. The games main story quests give you a direction to aim yourself at but how you get there is completely up to you.  However this is also where Divinity: Original Sin 2‚Äòs biggest problem rears its head. The game is terrible at informing you if you are on the right track in completing certain quest lines and is often vague, to the point of maddening frustration, when it comes to giving you any sort of hint when it comes to what you should do next. On the one hand it is nice that the game does not hold your hand as if you were a child who never played an RPG before, but on the other it would be nice to know why a quest that seems to be over isn‚Äôt. Sometimes you are not sure if you just missed something or if the quest line is just bugged because you approached it in a way the developers never expected or tested for.  This issue becomes more apparent the further along you get in the game. Act 1 is relatively aggravation free when it comes following quest lines or encountering bugs. But by the end of Act 2 you‚Äôll likely pull your hair out over at least a few quests or nonsensical bugs. The game has been out a month now and I‚Äôm still locked out of a handful of quest the developers have acknowledged are broken because of the way I triggered them. I was able to get past the major bugs that were in my way but a bunch still remain. The very thing that makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so amazing is the same thing that has caused issues with progressing further down quest lines or receiving rewards.  It‚Äôs by no means a game breaker and given the immense size of Divinity: Original Sin 2 and the sheer scope of what you can choose to do its amazing the game does not have more issues. The quest log definitely needs an overhaul and there are several major bugs that still need addressing but Larian Studios has already dropped a few hotfixes and one very large patch to address players concerns. Given the wonderful support Divinity: Original Sin 1 received I have no doubt that Divinity: Original Sin 2‚Äòs remaining blemishes will be ironed out before too long."

The fact that most people hate me cause I'm a lizard is cool because the story rotates on what race you are as well. I might even make a second character just to see the reactions and how playing with different companions play out.

I saw a lot of merit to its combat, flexible quests and vibrant presentation, but thought the lack of direction, both from a narrative and gameplay standpoint, alongside some tonal issues, were sore points that kept me from really breaking into it. Several years later and Larian Studios have done just what I hoped they would, making a sequel that retains the strengths of previous game while addressing just about every issue I had with it, and then going even further with additions like full voice acting, something not generally found in the recent wave of cRPG games. Due to the relatively high difficulty and patience required it may still not be for everybody, but Divinity: Original Sin 2 is very much at the pinnacle of the sub-genre and will no doubt prove intoxicating for those who get trapped in its spell.   continue reading [www.newgamenetwork.com] "

Magic and Phsyical armour is great too, it's satisfying to break through armour and seeing the health bar drop like in bayonetta.

darthaegis,187,5,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,56.8,"TL:DR Original Sin II is very good. If you want a game with really fun combat and some good exploration, you've got one right here. The game maintains a higher overall standard of quality than its predecessor, but combat has some big issues and the later two areas are fairly weak. I found it to be good, but I was disappointed at the lack of improvement over a lot of areas where the first game could use some. ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÜ  Divinity: Original Sin II is an isometric RPG where you play as a Sourcerer, a person capable of wielding the mighty power of Source. You get to pick your character and choose a preset class or edit one, and choose an origin or just create a custom character altogether. Origin characters have actual personal stories and motivations in the world besides the beginning of the main plot. My character seemed a bit meh at first (Sebille, an elf looking for the lizard who enslaved her so she could kill him) but it got to an interesting twist. Other characters I picked on my party ended up being more interesting, but you don't get direct access to their conversations. The game isn't really big on choices and consequences, so I found these things mostly side fluff.  The main plot begins with your character and all origin characters, as well as the starting cutscene narrator, being sent to a prison-island (the rather ironically named Fort Joy) to get treated of their Source condition. It's totally fine to be able to shoot fireballs since that's not Sourcery, but using that to remove debuffs or get yourself an extra turn gets you imprisoned because it attracts Voidwoken, creatures which only appear near manifestations of Source. There's quite a lot of ways to escape Fort Joy, which makes it feel a bit strange how there are still so many people inside. There's also the fact there are weapon and skill trader prisoners, which makes me feel the setting wasn't very well thought out.  To be honest, since I played the first game at launch, I wasn't expecting a terrific story/setting from this one. But for all the new writers they hired, it feels like there's not a huge improvement. The story didn't really grab me, even though it was better than the last game's ""There's this big dragon you have to defeat."" It did the job for giving you an extra reason to explore the world, but I didn't find it anything groundbreaking. After 56 hours I got the ending cutscene showing the consequences of my actions throughout the game ala Fallout, and I found I didn't remember half the people the cutscene was talking about at first (one or two I chuckled while hearing what they did after the ending, since I actually killed them in the game).  Anyway, enough with story crap, since the Original Sin games are more about exploring and using massive cheese to kill things or reach places which are difficult to reach. Exploration is fun, and there's a lot of interesting things to find in the four areas of the game, but the latter two (also, fortunately, the shortest, occupying roughly 15 of my 56 hours) are where the game starts to fall off in quality. The final area seemed to lack polish on a basic level, even: I found a corpse named UNKNOWN and a portrait with the name ""Painting of a Fan - Placeholder"". The first two areas tend to be more fun, but the thing is they felt fairly railroaded as for where to go. Even though you can sometimes go to places you have no business being in by use of teleportation skills, it's often very hard to fight enemies which are even only one level above you. This makes it so you have to almost take a specific path through the game in order not to find massive difficulty spikes. The second area also feels a bit themepark-y, with some clear sub-area separation by a sort of theme (desert, cemetery, etc.).  Exploring will get you some really creative quests, ranging from helping animals find love to more serious matters like stopping people from getting killed. The quest log doesn't often give you an ultra-clear indication on what to do, so it's fun to experiment a bit (though sometimes what you have to do to progress is fairly weird to think of, especially towards the endgame). Your characters will often find hidden switches and buried chests with treasure, too. The items are mostly randomized and you won't stay with them for long since they become obsolete at level up, but it's still fun to find good loot.  Original Sin II's strongest point, like its predecessor, is, of course, the combat. Unfortunately, they ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up some things here. First, the level difference is the most important stat in combat unless you intend to do ungodly cheese like unloading boxes of Deathfog on someone (instantly killing any non-undead) or teleporting them to a high-level NPC, and this is worse at certain levels where HP and damage numbers just get an arbitrary 50% boost. Then you have the fact that everything has been very much simplified (attributes and skills pretty much only giving +5% bonuses to a stat now, and there being a fixed AP for all characters unless hasted, which means you pretty much level your damage stat in braindead mode until you need some initiative or skill slots). You also have a new armor system made to make combat not be a disable-fest immediately, but having it take three turns of whittling down a secondary HP bar so you can start a cancerous disable-fest. Finally, initiative (the stat which determines how early your turn is in the whole combat round) is broken and non-moddable unlike the rest of these problems. It's basically a forced player-enemy-player round order which makes initiative a lot less meaningful.  With the (massive) problems combat has out of the way, the big upside to it is that it's still ridiculous fun. The addition of two new skill types (Polymorph and Summoning) increased the variety in builds by a lot. Unfortunately you can't respec on the first act, but this helps figure out a party plan for the rest of the game, where you can do it with no cost. I ended up going with a sub-optimal party composition (with three massive physical damage dealers and only one magician, which doesn't often work well because of the armor system, where there is a separate value for physical damage/disable blocking and magical), but it got me through the game with no major difficulty (though I must stress that since I didn't find my level's area at a certain point in the game, I started squeezing every bit of XP from quests I had left, leaving me overleveled by 1-2 levels for 40% of the game, which made it probably a lot easier). Each skill type has quite a lot of different spells, enabling your creativity to get out of particularly hard fights. While physical damage is mostly clean for the environment, magical will make your battleground an entertaining chaos of fire, poison and electrified water, to name a few (mostly fire though), and I don't think I'll forget a certain fight on an oil rig (I imagine my graphics card won't either, as it's likely scarred from having to render so much goddamn fire!) This doesn't mean physical damage is less fun, as both the Scoundrel and Warfare trees give some decent mobility for melee fighters to get into position and backstab or smash foes to the ground, and rangers are made more fun in this game with the addition of high ground, making positioning even more important, and fights more interesting in general. The summoning skill tree is mostly about strengthening your summons, the main one being the Incarnate, whose abilities change depending on the surface it's cast on (the Incarnate gets a powerful upgrade ONLY at max summoning, which I found fairly dumb). It's really amazing that with all its problems, Original Sin II's combat is still so goddamn fun.  In the end, it's more Original Sin: the story's better, and exploring and fighting still rewards creativity. I was disappointed that they didn't improve that much, but I still had good fun with the game."

Adding in extra races, characters with origin stories that actually effect the story of the game, having a storyline that makes more sense then the last game and adding in romance options has really created an atmosphere that exeeds the previous game.  Adding in more spells (a new school has been added; Polymorph) and adding physical armour and magic armour instead of just health has really expanded on the combat.  The only con to this game is the quests and the way that they are explained/the player is directed. This was a problem in the previous game, where if you don't do the quest exactly as the game wants it, you won't complete it. As well as this, the game once again doesn't explain quests adequetly. Quests will have very vague references that leave the player running around entire maps not understanding what the next step is. This was a very big problem for me in the Driftwood area, where there were a lot of quests, but I was given literally nothing to give me a clue as where to go.  I'd still give the game a 9/10 regardless, because I liked this game very much, and still continue to play it. There's a lot more content here than the previous game."

Su√°rez,108,3,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,367.3,"Long story short: this game is as close as a PC RPG can be to tabletop. 9.5/10    In my opinion, Divinity has 3 main selling points: a deep storyline that unfolds as you progress through the main quest and the various sidequests, and that's shaped by your decisions; a complex combat system that looks simpler that it is at first, and that takes a little while to get used to, and brings some refreshing concepts to tactical RPGs; and almost complete freedom given to the player.  Almost every quest, if not all of them, has more than a single outcome, and plenty of different ways to reach those ends. Furthermore, sidequests often overlap and meet each other, which simultaneously deepens the plot and encourages and rewards players for exploring. Frequently, puzzles or obstacles have multiple different solutions available; depending on your playstyle and party configuration, one solution or another may be easier or simpler.  Starting on Act II, you'll have access to free, infinite resets of your characters' atrributes, stats, and talents. This allows for extreme customization and adaptability - if a particular battle is proving to be too difficult, going back and trying a new configuration can be key. It also encourages players to try different combinations of skills. It should be noted that despite what the character creation screen says, there are really no classes in the game - anyone can be anything. The only requirements for equipment are your main stats (Strength, Finesse, Intelligence and Constitution), and for skills, your Ability Points. As long as you have the money to purchase Equipment and Skillbooks, you can customize your characters at will. (A remark: as of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I am not sure if this reset mechanic is available in the last Act. Most likely, I just didn't find it, but it's worth mentioning nonetheless)  On the flipside, the absolute freedom provided by the game can leave you lost at times. I am a very deliberate player and tried to uncover every quest and each corner of the map, and once, on Act II, I found myself facing very tough battles because I was actually supposed to be on the opposite side of the map - I figured this out when I went to said area and enemies were 3 levels lower than my party, which is quite rare in this game and made those battles trivial even on Tactician mode.  Another little complaint: characters with high Wits can find hidden objects in the map. Most of the time, those are hidden treasures you can dig for loot, but sometimes they uncover quest items, like hidden doors, levers or buttons. When those items are uncovered, your character will they spotted something, and the object will glow; but especially in the case of the small buttons, it's not obvious enough where the object is. It can be quite frustrating to spend minutes looking around for a button - I can understand having to do it manually, but if your character already FOUND it, it should be very clearly marked on the map and/or the screen, even more so in the case of plot related objects.  As for bugs, the game is not nearly as bugged as other reviews have made it sound like, although I only bought the game 3 days after release and the developers have been working on patches constantly, so some earlier bugs may have been fixed before I played the game. As of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I only encountered 3 ""serious"" bugs (naturally, they may be fixed already; also, minor spoilers ahead). The first was in Act II - talking to an NPC with may main character cancelled dialogues and interactions with said character permanently. A quick search on Google revealed a fix for this available a little later in the Act, but I simply loaded a save game made a couple of minutes earlier and proceeded as normal, ignoring the buggy NPC. The second was in Act IV; I was unable to complete the Blood Dowry sidequest, as the groom never appeared in his house's basement at all (probably my fault for breaking into his house and looting his stuff before actually realizing it was a quest point). The last bug was just weird and had no game breaking effect (aside from making me lose 2 Action Points in battle). In the final battle, when I used Battle Stomp on the Kraken, my screen switched to what seemed like the corner of the map, switched back, and no damage was dealt, but the Skill was used. Although I must remark that going after the Kraken was not a particularly promising strategy anyway...  (end of spoilers)  To sum it up, the game is fantastic. The dialogues are rich and provided with excellent voice acting, the plot is deep, the combat is fulfilling and the whole experience feels rewarding. A must have if you enjoy the genre."

Only on my second playthrough (because I can't stop) am I realizing how much story you will uncover or leave uncovered depending on who in your party is the flag-ship communicator with NPC's. I haven't felt this satisfied with dialouge since I played Fallout 2, if thats a good reference.  - auditory experience  sound effects, voice-acting, and sound tracks. These make up about 50% of what makes a game immersive for me. Every NPC is voice-casted well, sound effects are great, and the music is incredibley well done. Only reason for 8/10 is because, due to bugs or something, there will be lulls between tracks, effectively inturrupting the flow (imagine watching your favorite movie in the theater and a phone lights up). Fix this, add a few new tracks, and this goes to 10/10.  - challenging playthrough I loved WoW years ago (2007-2008) because of the way the game punished you for overestimating opponents and underestimating preparedness. RPG's today feel so overly generous to players in combat, and I was *overly excited* to find myself becoming angry and loading the game multiple times from dying.

I've audibly gasped, I've giggled like a kid. I've had some Ah ha! and some oh‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•... I want to include a small example as to why this game is an absolute must have and why it's so incredible to play with a friend.   Whatever you do, don't read any guides. Get lost, explore. Find neat‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Don't worry about your build or misspending points. I'm only level 7 on several play throughs but I have already mutated builds so suddenly in just a level or two it's not worth playing through the boat twenty times.   If you are planning on playing Divinity II do not read the next part. If you're on the fence, read the next part.     ****SMALL SPOILER AHEAD*****   There is a side quest early in the game involving what appears to be an undead/zombie man on a beach. My party decided to kill him before attempting anything else and we ended up with this sweet ring. The problem was, this ring belonged to a person that a Magister was looking for. Well‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• let's go talk to her and let her know this guy is dead. So we go talk to the Magister. Turns out this guy is her father. We tell her he's dead and looked super nasty. She asks for proof and the only proof we have is this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing guys ring.   Let me pause for a moment. For this early on, this ring is like a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing cheat code. It gives magic armor, some other stat, but the big thing is that is let's the user cast restoration.   So the only way to advance the quest is to give her the ring, otherwise she thinks you're ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing with her to get her to leave her post. We decide we wanna see the event through, so I give up my precious and we follow her back to the beach where this Magister is losing her mind and crying over her undead (now dead) father's corpse. Clearly she's distraught, but I want that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing ring. She's not gonna give it up, it's her Dad's ring and he's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing dead and corrupted in front of her.  After getting caught attempting to pickpocket the ring which I still maintain is what literally every rogue-ish character would do in this situation, me and my friend found ourselves in combat with a Magister. My friend who has taken a starting level in necromancer starts laughing uncontrollably and we both watch as his little Dwarf named Opal raises the Magister's fathers body into a grotesque pile of gore, and then slaps the now distraught Magister in the face with her (un)undead father's intestines which then exploded into a cloud of viscera and splooge.   Seriously, get this game, get off the boat, and start exploring. Get creative, there's a lot you can do and many ways to do it.    "
TrumpKingsly,149,3,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,136.4,"This is an extremely deep, extremely interesting RPG (gameplay and narrative) that doesn't know how combat works and rushes the everloving Hell out of its ending.  The Narrative is Easily the Best Part of this Game The narrative is about power and servitude. A movie would typically tackle this subject using a protagonist and an antagonist in a singular case study. We'd form some kind of opinion on it after seing what goes down between those two people. Original Sin 2 is a 100+ hour videogame that tackles the subject using many protags and antags in many separate and different case studies and thought experiments. This means we form our opinion after seeing the power/servitude dynamic play out in a bunch of different contexts. It's really effective at helping the player form a rich opinion, by the time it's done.  But Combat and the Ending are Serious Sore Spots However, there are two jagged thorns stuck deep within the side of this game: combat difficulty and the story's ending. These thorns are so jagged, in fact, that I have a major doubt: the review outlets giving this a 10/10 probably didn't finish the game and probably played it on easy mode.  Combat encounters are each either so easy that none of your party even lose their armor, or they're actually impossible to win. There is no middle ground. When they're impossible, this is because the game cheats on behalf of your enemies. They get an astounding number of action points in a turn. They cast the same AoE decimator spell every single turn. They mind control your party through their magic armor. They're a mob, each member of which has infinite initiative, so they all go before your first party member has their turn. Or you make a certain ludicrous decision at the end game and you're faced with a 1v10 that gives you one move to kill everyone. Hilarious.  To win these impossible fights, you have to cheat. Save scum, obviously. But, beyond that, you have to reload, then position your party as if they're psychics--in ways you could not possibly have known would work before going into the fight the first time. Or, you have to destroy parts of the environment before stepping on that tile that triggers the fight. Or, you have to kill all the nurses in the Doctor's house before you go and talk to him. Cheat at this game. Become a save-scum psychic and leave your foes baffled at your god-like foresight.  And then there's the ending. The gameplay leading to the end is pretty cool. Some complicated puzzles, most of which are literally spelled out for you if you talk to everyone in the final zone. But at least one puzzle will remain unspoiled until you have to complete it.  Then, you get a huge boss fight full of cheating enemies that you win by the skin of your teeth. Almost all of those enemies are, as far as I can tell, the biggest narrative inconsistency in history. Then, the narrator gives you some boilerplate about ""remember all that stuff that happened in the game."" That is just barely a paraphrase of what he says. Character- and decision-specificity are at absolute 0 in that boilerplate. Then, he asks ""Remembering that stuff, what do you do?"" You pick one of three choices. I picked the first choice. ""Okay, so you picked the first choice. Now you get this thing. What do you do with it?"" Three more choices. You pick one and get 30-60 seconds of post-game cutscene featuring some vagary about a character that really didn't matter and an extremely brief summary of the way things stand after your decision.  And then you're done. Recently, Larian enabled playing after the endgame, so you're brought back to your base to finish side quests or otherwise derp about with your endgame loot. Here's the thing, though. 3/4 of my party died during the last fight. Never got a chance to res anyone. One of that 3/4 was the character I created at the start. So, another party member won the game. Only my created character goes back to base after the credits, and guess what? He's still dead, so I get a game over screen and am asked to reload the boss fight.  Nice.  Conclusion This game is extremely good. Addictive, even. It stands tall and proud above most other story-driven games I've ever played. Then, there are the ""challenging"" fights and the sloppy, heartless ending that easily hack off its legs at the knees. Overall, I recommend, because 125/126 hours being fantastic is a great thing. But, that hour of poor quality is a really, super important hour."

RT-XD,296,3,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,144.4,"I've been holding out on writing a review for this game until I finished it, which took ages because I put the difficulty to tactician mode which made things extremely difficult!! (But very fun!) I put 144H to finish one playthrough.  The best way I can put it is: it's probably the best game I've ever played since Witcher 3.  I backed this game after playing the first Original Sin, which left me wanting to play even more! I definitely made the right decision. There's a lot of freedom in this game; playing with friends, playing alone and even doing our own DM games. I only played it in Single player mode so far, but I'm very much looking forward to playing with friends when they get the game. Here's a general pros and cons list (from a single player perspective):  + Graphics are great + Runs really well + Gameplay is fantastic (if you like turn-based games) + You can pretty much do anything and kill anyone you want + Voice acting is phenominal + Companions each have their own backgrounds which tie in with the main story line, really giving you a sense of wonder and motivation to find out what's going on and how to 'fix' it. + Workshop and Modding (read below for more)  - There were a few issues with quests not finishing properly, or not being able to talk properly to some NPCs, leading to missed XP and story (but a lot of that got fixed recently) - Tactician mode is difficult. Really makes you work hard to find as much XP before moving onto other parts. Especially at the beginning of the game.  Now here's the BEST part of all this: Larian even gave us the Divinity Engine 2 to us for making our own Campains and DM games. Which means...we can look forward to people creating their own stories and Campaigns in the future - something which I really look forward to seeing and playing.   Get it now! It's totally worth it!  EDIT: Nominated for the ""Even better than I expected"" award. Because it truly was better than I expected...makes sense right?"

Darkhollow,264,3,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,146.3,"I would like to preface some things before I start my review: I have been a fan of Larian and their Divine Divinity games since the first game in the series that came out in 2002.  It has taken me 145 hours to complete Divinity Original Sin 2 and I just want to say that it was one of the best CRPG experiences that I have had since I finished Planescape Torment (for the first time) back in 2013.   Now onto the  Pro and Cons followed by my final thoughts.  Pro:   - Interesting story & interesting party members with choice & consequences - Amazing soundtrack - Great replayability (multiple endings, different classes & origins to pursue) - All dialogue is fully voiced (major props to Larian for taking the huge undertaking on fully voicing every line of dialogue in the game) - Robust crafting system - Interactive open world gameplay (picking up objects and moving them around to your advantage or to plan strategies) - Robust character & class customization with the option of respeccing  Cons:  - Optimization issues mainly in the second half of the game/later acts (solved via patches) - Some bugged quests that don't complete properly or don't trigger (solved via patches) - No search item bar option in the inventory for specific items (quality of life improvement)   Conclusion: The sheer amount of content and replayability that you get from this game is staggering and I cannot fathom how Larian have managed to create such an amazing game in such a short span of time (2 years).   I would like to thank Larian and everyone involved including the Kickstarter backers help create this masterpiece. The praise it has received from numerous gaming outlets is well deserved.  Now...do I recommend this game? This is one of those games that shouldn't be missed, because it's one of the best CRPG's ever created and if you have any incling of trying a turn based RPG then I can say without a shadow of a doubt that this game is worth your money."

It's getting very good reviews.  Suffice to say that it's one of the only RPGs that tick all the boxes for me.  I'm a story guy, and it has excellent writing, voice acting, and role-playing.  But what really sets this game apart for me is how diverse and engaging the gameplay is.  It has an Ultima-like world model sandbox quality to it, and the combat (which is boring to me in about 90% of all RPGs) is consistently excellent.    The reason I'm writing this, though, is because of the many ""it's buggy and crashes all the time"" reports.  I can't say for sure that it's *not* crashing for those folks, because why would they lie?  All I can tell you is that I have played for over 50 hours and have not had a single crash.  Not one.

Wonder Llama,205,3,0,"October 4, 2017",Recommended,271.1,"This is possibly one of the first times I've really stopped to review a game in any thoughtful manner. I'm not one for doing so, or for commenting in public in general. That in itself should tell you something about the sheer brilliance of this game.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is quite possibly one of the best games ever created, or at the very least one of the best RPGs ever made. Never before have I been so sucked in, so compelled by a game and its story, lore, and characters.  One of the first things you'll notice about DOS2 is the atmosphere. The musical cues, the environment, the feel of ever-present danger, a truly epic quest, and of course, the soundtrack. My god, the soundtrack.  Combat is innovative and feels really good. With an 'open-class' concept and enough spells and abilities, you can make just about any kind of character you could imagine. From a blood-sucking witch that dabbles in lightning to a sturdy warrior with a healing spell or two. And more notably, many of these spells can be combined with either others or the environment to create incredible effects. Toss a fireball into a pit of poison to make it explode into flames, or shock a pool of blood or water to possibly stun everyone caught within.  The game is hard at times, surely. Even on the easiest difficulty (which honestly can be -too- easy sometimes), you'll have to have to really think about the battlefield conditions. Honour mode especially gets mention; brutal, wonderfully intense combat mixed with your basic ironman mode. Wipe your whole party and its game over with a single save.  Finally, it's the story that truly shines in this game. I've played a -lot- of games in my day, but hands-down DOS2 is one of the single most powerful games I've played. The main story is sturdy enough to stand on its own and only gets better as you venture onward, and especially the last few hours will have you questioning everything. Your companions, who take the form of the other origins stories you don't pick at the start, have rich storylines each with a very nice twist. The voice acting is excellent, as is the narration, and the ability to romance one of your companions later in the story makes for a pleasant little plot point.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an incredible game, and you can tell Larian took their time to create a masterpiece. They succeeded. I can't see myself putting it down anytime soon. Fans of oldschool-esque RPGs with heavy emphasis on story, rejoice. Our savior has finally come."

bigeyoo,136,3,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,137.1,"I enjoyed the original Original Sin (heh) and felt this game would follow suit. I got into the early access and it felt very similar to the first, but more polished and the layout was more efficient.   The story is extremely in-depth, voice acting is exceptional with almost every npc having dialogue, a voice, and personality following suit.  The combat is great, targetting has been improved and what the reticle shows will happen is the actual result for the most part.

RT-XD,296,3,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,144.4,"I've been holding out on writing a review for this game until I finished it, which took ages because I put the difficulty to tactician mode which made things extremely difficult!! (But very fun!) I put 144H to finish one playthrough.  The best way I can put it is: it's probably the best game I've ever played since Witcher 3.  I backed this game after playing the first Original Sin, which left me wanting to play even more! I definitely made the right decision. There's a lot of freedom in this game; playing with friends, playing alone and even doing our own DM games. I only played it in Single player mode so far, but I'm very much looking forward to playing with friends when they get the game. Here's a general pros and cons list (from a single player perspective):  + Graphics are great + Runs really well + Gameplay is fantastic (if you like turn-based games) + You can pretty much do anything and kill anyone you want + Voice acting is phenominal + Companions each have their own backgrounds which tie in with the main story line, really giving you a sense of wonder and motivation to find out what's going on and how to 'fix' it. + Workshop and Modding (read below for more)  - There were a few issues with quests not finishing properly, or not being able to talk properly to some NPCs, leading to missed XP and story (but a lot of that got fixed recently) - Tactician mode is difficult. Really makes you work hard to find as much XP before moving onto other parts. Especially at the beginning of the game.  Now here's the BEST part of all this: Larian even gave us the Divinity Engine 2 to us for making our own Campains and DM games. Which means...we can look forward to people creating their own stories and Campaigns in the future - something which I really look forward to seeing and playing.   Get it now! It's totally worth it!  EDIT: Nominated for the ""Even better than I expected"" award. Because it truly was better than I expected...makes sense right?"

I hate how amazingly detailed the story is, I hate how This whoel game takes you on an emotional roller coaster of wonder, tragedy, and awe.I hate how complex and interesting the fighting system is, how beautiful the graphics are, and how you can customize your character to give them whatever backstory interests you. I hate how rewarding the game is when you complete a quest; Overthrow and assassinate a corrupt world leader? Fight a giant purple worm? Slay an evil witch to free and befriend a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing DRAGON?! ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. YES. THAT IS AWESOME. This is not even end game stuff, I've only gotten to the 2nd area.   I hate this game because it is ruining my life by being so addictive I'd rather retrace my 2.5 hours of gameplay due to not saving than to get off my‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•and do homework. AND this is only the single player experience. Buy this game NOW if you've ever liked a game even remotely similar to this one. D&D, WoW (or any MMORPG), any action RPG like Diablo or Path of Exile, or just fastasy games in general. Solid 9/10 discounting their ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• save system. So just REMEMBER TO SAVE AFTER EVERY FIGHT, THEY WON'T SAVE YOUR GAME FOR YOU, SERIOUSLY THIS IS THE ONLY BAD THING IN THE GAME.   Ok, I'm done.

I have lost and retraced at least 10-12 hours of my 50 hours of gameplay due to forgetting that this game only quicksaves every blue moon. I understand that there are settings and sliders to determine when saves happen, but either I'm a complete dunce or that system is confusing. ALSO, QUICKSAVE BEFORE FIGHTS HAPPEN. I don't care if they spoil the surprise, just... At the beginning of a hostile area, or whenever you're about to talk to someone who's supposed to kill you, please help a bro out so they don't have to redo their search for source, resurrection scrolls AND two long‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•fight scenes.   Your game is a work of art and I haven't even got out of the hollow marshes yet. Would be a 10/10 if the saves didn't ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me over so often."

Nothing ever feels misplaced in the world... the level of detail, it rivals the likes of Witcher 3 and Breath of the Wild.

Fire is eternal, just get use to the burn damage  Editing this review to be more serious and to encourage others to play this, but there is honestly no words to convey what is simply an actual work of art graphically, mechanically, art and graphically, character and storywise.  Sit in the mainmenu and let the opening theme drag you into the mood of the game. Start a fight and let the orchestra rise and hype you to fight dragons and demons, or a fistfight in a tavern gets even more roudy with the mixture of brass and string. start the character screen and listen to the origin stories of all the characters for your first game,  listening to the fully voiced professional voice actors lay the background for the Characters own subplots that string along with the main game(Lohse is awesome as is the Red Prince).  Start your game and enjoy every view, walk along beaches of ruined castles, explore though caves with ancient unknown ruins, walk through the massive capital of Rivellon And just get wrapped up as the story twists and turns its way through the mythical land of rivelon for almost 120 hours of straight story that i honestly lost track of time playing (alot of my time was spent playing offline) And the best part? Do it all again and its just as good. Me and 3 friends all made custom characters and we are doing it all again and its just as fun as when we first started, the game was made for the party of 4 aspect like a good D&D game with your best friends after school.  Even if the main story wears you out, the game offers a well thought out editor to make your own maps and campaigns to really bring that D&D experience back, or download a top rated campaign from the workshop, all while playing the soundtrack back on youtube on a playlist because that full orchestra really gets me  Normally games in the 40-50 price range turn me around but this game really shines in a time of half completed main industry titles and half‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•resells of RPGs, this game will bring back that experience of the golden age of game design when games were meant to be played and not sold. It deserves its overwhelmingly positive score, its nomination for RPG of the year despite being a PC only title as i was just that much loved by those who played it, and it deserves more people to play and love it just as me and my friends have.

Roger Feederer,204,3,0,"November 12, 2017",Recommended,42.8,"The true game of the year in 2017.  Hopefully the steam review system/tagging system gets this game to pop up on your store, because you probably won't hear about it from major outlets or podcasts.  I honestly thought turn based strategy had gone the way of XCOM.  Divinity, however, can be more readily compared to Dragon Age: Origins...only with more story, more character customization, interesting party members and fun yet challenging combat.  There's no need to experience any of the previous games (I didn't).  If you have ever enjoyed RPGs then play this game."
ÊâÄÊ¨≤ÈöèÂøÉ,34,3,0,"December 16, 2017",Recommended,48.9,"fun game, real high quality, one of the best RPGs I will say."
RainyDay,121,3,0,March 31,Recommended,129.6,"An absolutely incredible experience, without a doubt, one of the finest rpgs to date, it certainly is the best I‚Äôve ever played.  I wouldn‚Äôt know where to begin, the world is as interesting and alive as the long and beautifully crafted story, which stays strong for almost all of its entire 130h runtime.  If you‚Äôre new to rpgs, you might be put off by the inherent amount of lore and world building exposition these kinds of games often exhibit, but I must say that the game does a remarkable job of giving you all the information you need without overwhelming you. The world building is constant and just detailed enough as to make you want to fill in the details yourself using your own imagination.  Having not played the original Divinity Original Sin, I did not once feel like I was missing some important piece of lore or that I had missed out on anything story-wise, which is something I truly appreciate from the developers.  The writing is witty, fresh and fully voice acted. Not one person, monster or animal goes without a voice. The voice acting is also excellent, a pleasant surprise seeing how much has been had to be dubbed.  Combat is a lot of fun, and it only gets better the more you level up and are able to experiment with new interesting skills and combos; the only thing I feel could have been done better is how the different skill trees are explained. As it stands, only a very basic description is given, when important information, like that hydro spells are in the most part curative or that pyro spells focus more on damage should be explained somewhere. This is not such a major issue due to the fact that players are given the opportunity to respec at any time once they reach a certain point in the story (fairly early) , but still, it does make investing into certain trees a bit dangerous and daunting as a new player.  Overall, the game has provided me with a beautiful experience and I‚Äôm left reminiscing about my adventures in Rivellon alongside my memorable companions, thinking about what I could have done differently.  If you have even a passing interest in rpgs, try it, you won‚Äôt regret a second of it."

Arsene-Lupin,517,3,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,44.2,"One CRPG to rule them all, one CRPG to inspire them, One CRPG to bring them all and in the darkness enthrall them In the land of Steam where Divinity shall never die.  ....  There are only two things you need to know about Divinity: Original Sin 2.  First, within one week of launch it became the highest-rated games of all time on Metacritic (it currently has a metascore of 95).  Second, all of that critical acclaim is completely deserved.  You see, a very long time ago there was a game called Baldur's Gate 2. It was incredible. An enormous CRPG with engaging combat, compelling characters, and an intriguiing narrative. It demonstrated just how good a roleplaying game could be, and established a standard of quality that would cast a shadow over every subsequent CRPG for decades. For a very long time, we convinved ourselves that Baldur's Gate 2 was an outlier. An abberation. That we would never see another game of similar scope, scale or quality again. And that we were wrong to expect such grand ambitions from even our most beloved of developers.  But we were wrong.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is the game we have been waiting for. It is a spectacular, transcendental experience. Compex, challenging gameplay married to a well-written and extraordinarily dynamic narrative; gorgeous visuals and skilled voice acting; a phenomenal soundtrack and an overall design that grants players an unprecedented level of freedom.  But you know all of this already. Original Sin 2 has already thoroughly enmeshed itself into the zeitgeist. That metascore did not happen by accident, and you know it. The 10,000+ user reviews that are almost exclusively positive are likewise no accident.  This is it. The game that was promised. The game we never thought would come. Divinity Original Sin 2 is, finally, the true successor to Baldur's gate, not because it has a similar style of gameplay, or a similar tone or narrative style, but because of what it represents: a new standard for the genre.  Truly, it is one CRPG fit to rule them all."
Su√°rez,108,3,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,367.3,"Long story short: this game is as close as a PC RPG can be to tabletop. 9.5/10    In my opinion, Divinity has 3 main selling points: a deep storyline that unfolds as you progress through the main quest and the various sidequests, and that's shaped by your decisions; a complex combat system that looks simpler that it is at first, and that takes a little while to get used to, and brings some refreshing concepts to tactical RPGs; and almost complete freedom given to the player.  Almost every quest, if not all of them, has more than a single outcome, and plenty of different ways to reach those ends. Furthermore, sidequests often overlap and meet each other, which simultaneously deepens the plot and encourages and rewards players for exploring. Frequently, puzzles or obstacles have multiple different solutions available; depending on your playstyle and party configuration, one solution or another may be easier or simpler.  Starting on Act II, you'll have access to free, infinite resets of your characters' atrributes, stats, and talents. This allows for extreme customization and adaptability - if a particular battle is proving to be too difficult, going back and trying a new configuration can be key. It also encourages players to try different combinations of skills. It should be noted that despite what the character creation screen says, there are really no classes in the game - anyone can be anything. The only requirements for equipment are your main stats (Strength, Finesse, Intelligence and Constitution), and for skills, your Ability Points. As long as you have the money to purchase Equipment and Skillbooks, you can customize your characters at will. (A remark: as of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I am not sure if this reset mechanic is available in the last Act. Most likely, I just didn't find it, but it's worth mentioning nonetheless)  On the flipside, the absolute freedom provided by the game can leave you lost at times. I am a very deliberate player and tried to uncover every quest and each corner of the map, and once, on Act II, I found myself facing very tough battles because I was actually supposed to be on the opposite side of the map - I figured this out when I went to said area and enemies were 3 levels lower than my party, which is quite rare in this game and made those battles trivial even on Tactician mode.  Another little complaint: characters with high Wits can find hidden objects in the map. Most of the time, those are hidden treasures you can dig for loot, but sometimes they uncover quest items, like hidden doors, levers or buttons. When those items are uncovered, your character will they spotted something, and the object will glow; but especially in the case of the small buttons, it's not obvious enough where the object is. It can be quite frustrating to spend minutes looking around for a button - I can understand having to do it manually, but if your character already FOUND it, it should be very clearly marked on the map and/or the screen, even more so in the case of plot related objects.  As for bugs, the game is not nearly as bugged as other reviews have made it sound like, although I only bought the game 3 days after release and the developers have been working on patches constantly, so some earlier bugs may have been fixed before I played the game. As of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I only encountered 3 ""serious"" bugs (naturally, they may be fixed already; also, minor spoilers ahead). The first was in Act II - talking to an NPC with may main character cancelled dialogues and interactions with said character permanently. A quick search on Google revealed a fix for this available a little later in the Act, but I simply loaded a save game made a couple of minutes earlier and proceeded as normal, ignoring the buggy NPC. The second was in Act IV; I was unable to complete the Blood Dowry sidequest, as the groom never appeared in his house's basement at all (probably my fault for breaking into his house and looting his stuff before actually realizing it was a quest point). The last bug was just weird and had no game breaking effect (aside from making me lose 2 Action Points in battle). In the final battle, when I used Battle Stomp on the Kraken, my screen switched to what seemed like the corner of the map, switched back, and no damage was dealt, but the Skill was used. Although I must remark that going after the Kraken was not a particularly promising strategy anyway...  (end of spoilers)  To sum it up, the game is fantastic. The dialogues are rich and provided with excellent voice acting, the plot is deep, the combat is fulfilling and the whole experience feels rewarding. A must have if you enjoy the genre."

A gripping story wrapped into an amazing setting with fantastic characters, to the tune of a turn based isometric CRPG. This is the kind of game that triple A devs should aspire to be.

gerganon,31,3,0,"September 5, 2017",Recommended,474.6,"             This review will cover each aspect of the game and will be updated after full release: sound, gameplay, story, art etc.               Some things can only be understood if you actually experience them, so I won't go into much detail about those amazing things that make this game stand out from anything I have ever played.  The sounds, and music are part of this experience and I can't really describe how calming the sound of waves lapping on the beach is, or how tense the screams of a sadistic tortue chamber changes the atmosphere of the game.  Sound and music are excellent.  Full voice acting for all characters really encases you within the immersiveness of this world.                I've enjoyed 100 hours on the first Original Sin, and 150 hours on the Enhanced Edition, and the gameplay that made that game such a success has only been evolved and molded into a what can only be described as a masterpiece.                  I'll start with the simplest form of gameplay: Combat.  While simple in essence, the amount of possibilities and ways to approach every battle give the combat in this game replayability and makes it never feel monotonous.  You will find yourself planning turns ahead, baiting enemies into a tighter space, saving AP and waiting to spring a trap on them- just for your enemies to do the same to you.  Early access only has access to a ""medium"" difficulty, and as a veteran of the series I can say that while it isn't a walk in the park, it won't require too much out of a well thought out party.  Character planning and preparedness make the difficulty in my opinion, as starting battles differently will show you that a battle that you may have once thought very hard, can become very easy if starting it out thinking outside the box.  Picking up that oil barrel you saw way back, carrying and sneaking it into the middle of an enemy pack, sneaking out, and opening combat with that firescroll you have been saving since the beginning of the game is just one of the many ways you can make the game easier for yourself.                While the game rewards thinking in that aspect, one of my favourite things about this game so far is that it DOESN'T reward you traditionally.  A talent ""Pet-Pal"" will let you talk to animals, and you may expect that every animal you talk to should give you something in return, by nature of spending a hard-earned talent point on the ability.  While sometimes that may be the case, more-often than not you are rewarded with a thought-provoking sentiment from a creature that is just trying to survive in this crazy world.  Consoling and replacing an orphaned bear's parental figure, or trying to explain to a dog what death means won't give you EXP or skills, but will tweak your heart-strings and remind you that there is nothing you can't expect in this world that larian has created.                The story of this game is interesting, as it will be very different depending on who you are playing as, or who you are playing with.  6 Origin characters each have their own goals and will play the game according to their needs.  And even if you aren't playing as them, they will continue throughout the world trying to accomplish their unique goals.  And woe be to those that will stand in their way.  Will you help them or turn them against each other? Or pursuade them to join you?  Or use them to as a means to an end to find better treasure and kill them when their usefulness has run out?  The characters are vastly improved upon the first game and out of everything, this is the part of the game that is the most improved and the most exciting for fans of original sin.                The only thing I can reccommend to players both new and old is that you really try to do EVERYTHING.  If you think it may be possible, just try it out.  What does 10 points in telekenisis and a really heavy object look like over-top of the enemies head?  Sneaking Pacifist playthroughs?  A character that lights everything around them on fire, then has their fire spells reduced in cost because of them standing on fire, and having so much fire-resist that they are healed by standing in it?                  The replayability of this game is insane because there are too many viable options to discover and explore.  The best part about it all is that you can play with 3 other people and do it all together."
Silent Andrew,42,3,0,"February 2, 2017",Recommended,49.5,"This game is a step in the right direction. Its fun because of all the role-playing choices you are able to choose from. 9/10 is what I give this early access game. If you enjoy games like D&D, then this game is a good choice."
Grey Knight,305,3,0,"September 1, 2017",Recommended,69.9,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a great game in early acces already.   ( I will update this review when I've played trough the full release of the game)  The developers are really listening to their community and even ask them what to improve, what to add/remove.  I've not that many hours in it yet since I don't want to play through act 1 yet (which is the early acces part) until I can play the entire story.  Some keyfeatures I like so far are: * Great storytelling * You can interact with ALL npc (and there are a lot of NPC) * Crafting * Wide choice of reactions in conversations * Multipe characters to pick from with their own story line * Split Screen co-op * 4 Player Drop in-out Co-op (multiplayer) * Deep tactical combat * Secret locations and treasures  Upcoming things I'm very excited about are: (these will be added on launch)  * You can play Undead as any race you like(!) * Fully voiceacted game * Skill/Spell crafting   The thing I'm also very excited about (and if you are a DnD player you should be aswell) is the DM mode. This will make it possible for DM's to play their campaigns in this game with: * worldmaps you can pick from a list or upload one yourself. * pick one of the premade playabble area's or even better create one yourself * map editor for Divinity Original Sin 2 * Support for up to 4 players and a DM * And they even have the Lost Mines of Phandelver (DnD starterpack) availible for play on launchday!  So it's clear for me Divinity: Original Sin 2 is already one of the greatest RPG's even though its still in early acces.   If you where not sure if you want to by this game just DO IT you won't regret it! The Dev team deserves it!  "

Even just looking around will have you waste hours thanks to breathtaking environment.   Where there is good there must be bad.

Fawlcon,57,3,0,"November 21, 2017",Recommended,"1,430.2","The good:  A very polished game, stunning graphics, voice acting, drop in-out co-op, multiple paths, re-play off the chain.  Game Master is a legitimate contender for Roll20 and like web sites for RPGs. They should try and copy what this game has done, but with more of a D&D rule system.    The bad:  If you like the PC doing the random save versus spells, you will not like the Magic and Physical armor combat.  This is not D&D rules.  Combat will always come down to keeping your armor up while trying to strip the enemies and using a bundle of crowd control to keep them from attacking you. I wish enemies scaled to your level. Example, if you fight hard enemies of superior level early, you will have a great challenge and might have to do multiple re-loads to win‚Ä¶BUT later you go to areas you missed or should have hit earlier and completely walk over the enemies who are of lower level.  The mix:  Once you understand the game mechanics and accept them, you begin to understand how to win battles against superior AI opponents through solid strategy.   The meh: The PC AI is hit or miss.  While there are times the AI does smart counters to your efforts, often it is the AI‚Äôs lack of intelligence that allows you to overcome those odds and cheapens the victory.   I can boast that I finished the game and will likely do multiple runs. Second, I have completed a lavish GM campaign that I will post in the workshop, so I have a complete understanding of the game.  Lastly, I‚Äôve been gaming since pong‚Ä¶need I say more?  Final thought:  If you want to experience everything this game has to offer, it would take multiple play throughs‚Ä¶some might see this as good, while others will see it as just too much an investment.  With GM mode I give this game an 9/10, without it an 8."

In the years that followed, theys left behind the dice and paper, moving into the realsm of digital wizardry, and in time they did beget the CRPG.  And it was good. A myriad of beardy, stats heavy mana did fall from heaven, and the faithful feasted on Baldurs Gates, Eyes of the Beholders, Neverwinters, Fallouts and Arx Fatalises.    A great time it was, indeed.  A time when quests could be solved by using your brain rather than murdering everything in sight.  A time when putting points into speech resulted in more than just a boost to bartering. A time when you could convince an endgame boss to kill himself if your stats would allow it.  Alas, a time of great darkness followed, and hither came the likes of Dragon Age 2 and Fallout 4, from whence there was little 'role-playing' and simply 'game' in its stead.  Bethesda and Bioware did cheer as they drowned in coin, but the 'R in the 'RPG' was thought lost forever, and the faithful seemed eternally doomed to walk the path of 'action adventures with skills trees but really you just have to murder everything',   'You don't need any of that old beardy old RPG nonsense' Dragin Age Inquisition cried.  'You need bland worlds of endless icons and fetch-questing between awkward digital sex scenes with elven waifus.  You won't have time for meaningful dialogue choices or stats that effect anything other than combat, not when there are farmers who need you to find lost sheep or villagers who need you to go into the forest and bring back10 rumpleberry leaves'.  All was thought lost...   But hark!  the Bespeckled Ones did hear thine prayer!  'A skill-tree doth not an RPG maketh!' cried Larian, and Divinity Original Sin did emerge from the darkenss, and it was good.  It was bloody good. It giveth from the fruits of meaningful dialogue, choices and actions with consequences, stats and character building that actually matter the game, and it blessed with the freedom to solve problems and quests in any way you could figure out.  And in the later years, Larian did beget Divinity Original Sin 2, and it was even better than the first in almost every way imaginable.  More complex, more engaging, more consequential to the players actions, better written, more co opy then before, just more in everyway!  And the faithful did rejoice! Multiple playthroughs were planned, and marriges and careers thrown to the wayside!  It was the RPG we all wanted...  The Bespeckled Ones have not forsaken us.   (FYI this is just a bit of a laugh.  DOS2 is brilliant - get it)"

Le Loup-garou,411,3,0,"November 5, 2017",Recommended,53.0,"Usually I find that a lot of games that try to fully emulate D&D mechanics suck. There are several exceptions obviously and many fantasy games have some charcteristics taken from D&D even if only minor ones.  This is D&D the video game. You CANNOT get closer without playing D&D or a similar table top with a group of friends. There is even multiplayer, which is amazing. This game is excellent and so story rich it is hard not to get totally absorbed, There is really only one progression path it seems in the main quest set but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.   I suggest playing a charcter with an orgin story as they provide a more immersive experience, and intrestting dialogue options in some situations. I haven't taken the time to use the Dungeon master mode but from what I've seen it makes game play essentially endless if full utilized. I'm not that creative but I'm sure someone is!"

The combat and all questing is never boring.  The game has been a real sense of accomplishment playing through it, it's so much fun to play with friends, so I'd really recommend this as a co-op game. However, playing solo is also very fun. All other games since I bought D:OS 2 have been outclassed by it in sense of enjoyment for me.

It plays like a classic RPG with turn based combat, action economy, skills, spells, multiple ways to build your characters, even multi classing and having it have drop in drop out 4 player cooperative is a very nice feature, can even be modded to have larger parties though you will unbalance the game for yourself and disable achievements. The in game lore and stories play well from one arc to the next and the scenes in which they are set are beautiful.  My only complaints about this game would be the lack of interesting none human player races, though the lizard folk are really nicely designed.  The fact you can move far enough away from active combat (sometimes) to leave combat and thus get infinite and free action economy whilst the rest of your team is playing turn by turn."

Le Loup-garou,411,3,0,"November 5, 2017",Recommended,53.0,"Usually I find that a lot of games that try to fully emulate D&D mechanics suck. There are several exceptions obviously and many fantasy games have some charcteristics taken from D&D even if only minor ones.  This is D&D the video game. You CANNOT get closer without playing D&D or a similar table top with a group of friends. There is even multiplayer, which is amazing. This game is excellent and so story rich it is hard not to get totally absorbed, There is really only one progression path it seems in the main quest set but that doesn't make it any less enjoyable.   I suggest playing a charcter with an orgin story as they provide a more immersive experience, and intrestting dialogue options in some situations. I haven't taken the time to use the Dungeon master mode but from what I've seen it makes game play essentially endless if full utilized. I'm not that creative but I'm sure someone is!"
zanos,300,3,0,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,102.0,"Wow, where do I begin...  This game harkens back to a time long past, a time of unforgiving games that don't hold your hand,  and offers you pithy clues to make your way through a vast uncompromising land replete with challenging combat, the odd puzzle, and a myriad of ways to deal with a situation rather than selecting an option through a chat box.   There were so many instances during my playthrough where I felt like I was breaking quests only to see them to completion in ways that would have involved a reload in others.  It's a game that stands on some firm philosophical foundations: questioning the nature of power, the idea of power corrupting or the good that can be done if consolidated. It explores the nature of institutions in a world gone awry, exemplifying the idea that the road to hell is most certainly paved with good intentions. The moral dilemmas are many, and in an almost Witcheresque fashion, the consequences of actions taken often come with a cost.  That being said, Larian is able to balance the seriousness of the subject with the humor, sarcasm, and satire that they are known for and given the gravity of the events unfolding, the humor adds an extra dimension to the game.  The combat is as challenging as you want it to be. I don't mean in terms of a difficulty slider, I mean in terms of scouring the forums for optimal builds or cheesing for gold to get the best possible equipment. I don't condemn either, I found it rather refreshing that the satisfaction of combat is as customizable as you want it to be depending on how one chooses to engage in a situation. Do you use environmental barrels? Reposition before engaging the situation? Run in and make do? Some of these will work, others will not, but what is interesting is that the solutions to these situations are many and are at the discretion of the player.  The companions you can choose all have excellent backgrounds, some more interesting than others, but all of them were noteworthy. What is also interesting about it is that they are not just there for you, like in most RPGs, they have their own ambitions, goals, and desires and often time going at odds with them could cost you a slot on your roster.   The quests and the world itself are amazing, especially the latter. It's not perfect, and you can clearly see some additional attention was given to certain areas of the game over others, but the different areas, the choices made, and consequences really strengthen the overall story and your journey from a prisoner in Fort Joy to its aftermath.   The quests, in typical Larian fashion, run the gamut. They vary from discovering a serial killer to the occasional rescue to providing an item or eliminating a threat. They are pretty standard fare, but what is interesting is how many different ways you can handle them and the consequences of handling them in the way that you do. There have been bugs with journal entries, and sometimes quests can seem rather baffling, but I didn't really let that upset me. I have no doubt that in the coming months they will be fixed and tightened up. But yeah, to some, and to me at times, it was frustrating.  All in all, this was an excellent game. Perhaps that isn't the right word, it was better than excellent. It was not without its faults, but I really got a lot out of it, from the story, to the challenging combat, the voice acting, the perks and quirks of communing with animals, the different ways to tackle each situation and even the soundtrack. It's a tightly knit rich and rewarding game that you savor long after it ends and even into the beginning of the next playthrough.    If you like CRPGs, you will most likely really see this as a worthy successor to the Fallout 2 style of CRPGs. People have been comparing it to Baldur's Gate 2, and, in terms of the story, companions, and the epic nature of the experience, you can definitely draw comparisons, but the combat is firmly rooted in the Fallout 2 or Temple of Elemental Evil tradition.  So, yeah, Larian does it again, even better than before. I expected a good game, even a great game, but I was not expecting this. It will be penned into the great book of RPG goodness that it deserves. Larian firmly deserves every bit of success they get from this title.   They have stolen the divinity from the former greats and it is perhaps only contested for the crown, in my opinion, by CDPR. Obsidian is also up there, but POE, even in all of its greatness, failed to evoke the same feelings that I had for this. It really filled the void left for me by the Witcher 3, and for those of you that know what I'm talking about and perhaps for those of you reading these reviews to see if it's a worthwhile purchase...it is.  Good luck in your future endeavors Larian, I, for one, will be there to continue to back your projects henceforth, bien fait."
Su√°rez,108,3,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,367.3,"Long story short: this game is as close as a PC RPG can be to tabletop. 9.5/10    In my opinion, Divinity has 3 main selling points: a deep storyline that unfolds as you progress through the main quest and the various sidequests, and that's shaped by your decisions; a complex combat system that looks simpler that it is at first, and that takes a little while to get used to, and brings some refreshing concepts to tactical RPGs; and almost complete freedom given to the player.  Almost every quest, if not all of them, has more than a single outcome, and plenty of different ways to reach those ends. Furthermore, sidequests often overlap and meet each other, which simultaneously deepens the plot and encourages and rewards players for exploring. Frequently, puzzles or obstacles have multiple different solutions available; depending on your playstyle and party configuration, one solution or another may be easier or simpler.  Starting on Act II, you'll have access to free, infinite resets of your characters' atrributes, stats, and talents. This allows for extreme customization and adaptability - if a particular battle is proving to be too difficult, going back and trying a new configuration can be key. It also encourages players to try different combinations of skills. It should be noted that despite what the character creation screen says, there are really no classes in the game - anyone can be anything. The only requirements for equipment are your main stats (Strength, Finesse, Intelligence and Constitution), and for skills, your Ability Points. As long as you have the money to purchase Equipment and Skillbooks, you can customize your characters at will. (A remark: as of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I am not sure if this reset mechanic is available in the last Act. Most likely, I just didn't find it, but it's worth mentioning nonetheless)  On the flipside, the absolute freedom provided by the game can leave you lost at times. I am a very deliberate player and tried to uncover every quest and each corner of the map, and once, on Act II, I found myself facing very tough battles because I was actually supposed to be on the opposite side of the map - I figured this out when I went to said area and enemies were 3 levels lower than my party, which is quite rare in this game and made those battles trivial even on Tactician mode.  Another little complaint: characters with high Wits can find hidden objects in the map. Most of the time, those are hidden treasures you can dig for loot, but sometimes they uncover quest items, like hidden doors, levers or buttons. When those items are uncovered, your character will they spotted something, and the object will glow; but especially in the case of the small buttons, it's not obvious enough where the object is. It can be quite frustrating to spend minutes looking around for a button - I can understand having to do it manually, but if your character already FOUND it, it should be very clearly marked on the map and/or the screen, even more so in the case of plot related objects.  As for bugs, the game is not nearly as bugged as other reviews have made it sound like, although I only bought the game 3 days after release and the developers have been working on patches constantly, so some earlier bugs may have been fixed before I played the game. As of the writing of this review, September 28th 2017, I only encountered 3 ""serious"" bugs (naturally, they may be fixed already; also, minor spoilers ahead). The first was in Act II - talking to an NPC with may main character cancelled dialogues and interactions with said character permanently. A quick search on Google revealed a fix for this available a little later in the Act, but I simply loaded a save game made a couple of minutes earlier and proceeded as normal, ignoring the buggy NPC. The second was in Act IV; I was unable to complete the Blood Dowry sidequest, as the groom never appeared in his house's basement at all (probably my fault for breaking into his house and looting his stuff before actually realizing it was a quest point). The last bug was just weird and had no game breaking effect (aside from making me lose 2 Action Points in battle). In the final battle, when I used Battle Stomp on the Kraken, my screen switched to what seemed like the corner of the map, switched back, and no damage was dealt, but the Skill was used. Although I must remark that going after the Kraken was not a particularly promising strategy anyway...  (end of spoilers)  To sum it up, the game is fantastic. The dialogues are rich and provided with excellent voice acting, the plot is deep, the combat is fulfilling and the whole experience feels rewarding. A must have if you enjoy the genre."

JaneDutohlav[TA],629,3,0,"November 26, 2017",Recommended,185.8,"This game is an awesome rpg co-op experience with your friends. It's even better than expected. I'd definitely recommend hard difficulty for experienced tactical players. On the other hand, the story pulls you in. There are a lot of side quests, puzzles, and mysteries as well.    At the beginning were the predefined characters not that interesting to me, but with time they grew to my heart. And seriously, every single NPC dubbed? With branching conversations? That's every rpg player's dream come true. So be prepared to read a lot too. Or not, that's up to you.    Combat? Feels very fluent and very similar to a combat from the first game. But now some skills can be better combined and create a potential for your cunning. For example: with Hydrosophist and Necromancer you can make Raining Blood - which creates blood surfaces, sets bleeding on enemies and douses fire surfaces - and those blood surfaces you can further electrify or freeze, or simply walk on it with blood sucker for some healing.   Music? Masterpiece by Borislav Slavov.  TL;DR: Like fantasy RPG and tactics? Get your best friends/partners and get it right now! "

Tucan,668,3,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,69.4," Scroll to bottom for summary    To start off, I just want to say that I am really enjoying this game quite a bit. I never played the first one and I decided to take a risk for myself by purchasing this because I have not played many turn-based strategy games that I truly enjoyed/got addicted to in the past.  However  this game has me hooked and at the moment I can't think of hardly any reasons as to why I would stop playing it any time soon.    Ok, but why?    Admittedly this game is definitely not for everyone but hopefully this next part will be helpful to someone who is on the fence about it.    You will likely enjoy this game if you...	  (note: These lists are ordered from the most to least impactful on the experience of the game in each category)   Typically enjoy...     ...combat  	  Turn-Based     Strategy     Co-Op     Party-Based     Tactical  Typically enjoy...     ...Genres	  RPG     Adventure     Fantasy     Open-World  Typically enjoy...     ...Styles/Design Choices	  Story Rich     Character Customization     Atmospheric     Great Soundtrack     Click-to-Move     Isometric/Top-Down (Toggleable by player) If you don't fit into any of the items above then this game probably isn't for you but I would still reccomend that you consider purchasing because as I said earlier, I very rarely enjoy Turn-based strategy games but currently I am enjoying this game a lot.  If based on the things mentioned above you think that you  will  like this game, then below is a list of pros & cons.     Pros  (not in any particular order)     In-Depth Character Customization	 (can be re-customized fairly simply without restarting from the beginging of the game)   Very well polished/detailed level design   Engaging and detailed story	  Vibrant atmospheric environments that each have unique characteristics and/or interesting areas to explore	  Great soundtrack that fits the environments very well	  Multiple ways to solve problems/complete quests	  Rarely uses HUD elements to display your objective (immersive)	  (instead of showing your current objective(s) with the HUD, your quests and assignments are told directly to your character by someone you must find and interact with then your objective is writen down in the journal)   Great NPC character voice acting	  Combat system has a very enjoyable amount of depth and skill required to fully master	  Ability to interact with nearly every item/NPC in the game	  It's very easy to just start playing a co-op game and have fun	  Good veriety of enemies, none of the enemies get overused to the point that they feel repetitive	  High resolution textures and shadows to compliment the beautiful variety of environments	  Cons  (likely that some of these are bugs that will be patched later)     Movement is not as elegant and simple as it could be	 (holding mouse1 or panning to the desired location and clicking)   Using the mouse to pan or rotate the camera is jittery and hard to look at even at very high frame rates	  Friendly AI in combat is poor and can make rescuing a friendly NPC in order to complete a quest feel more like a fight against the game and less like a combat scenario   	  Since there are sometimes very few hints as to where you need to go or who you need to talk to in order to complete a quest it can be frustrating to search an area for an extended period of time simply to complete one objective	  Occasional frame drops or inconsistency of frame times / frame rate in certain areas	  Party members sometimes do not move when the leader is moving until you select a different party member to lead, most commonly when changing elevation via a ladder or vine that leads to a part of the level that is currently on-screen	  Summary:	Divinity: Original Sin 2 can provide countless hours of questing, exploring, adventuring, and monster hunting in it's beautifully designed and expansive open-world with countless areas and secrets to find throughout the entire experience which is glued together by a phenomenal soundtrack and wrapped in a cozy blanket of extrodinary storytelling.   Story     10/10   Graphics     9/10   Gameplay     8/10   Sountrack     10/10   OVERALL 92/100  An absolutely amazing game but I had to take a few points off points for the bothersome movement controls and the friendly AI that tries to kill itself when you are trying to save it."

gerganon,31,3,0,"September 5, 2017",Recommended,474.6,"             This review will cover each aspect of the game and will be updated after full release: sound, gameplay, story, art etc.               Some things can only be understood if you actually experience them, so I won't go into much detail about those amazing things that make this game stand out from anything I have ever played.  The sounds, and music are part of this experience and I can't really describe how calming the sound of waves lapping on the beach is, or how tense the screams of a sadistic tortue chamber changes the atmosphere of the game.  Sound and music are excellent.  Full voice acting for all characters really encases you within the immersiveness of this world.                I've enjoyed 100 hours on the first Original Sin, and 150 hours on the Enhanced Edition, and the gameplay that made that game such a success has only been evolved and molded into a what can only be described as a masterpiece.                  I'll start with the simplest form of gameplay: Combat.  While simple in essence, the amount of possibilities and ways to approach every battle give the combat in this game replayability and makes it never feel monotonous.  You will find yourself planning turns ahead, baiting enemies into a tighter space, saving AP and waiting to spring a trap on them- just for your enemies to do the same to you.  Early access only has access to a ""medium"" difficulty, and as a veteran of the series I can say that while it isn't a walk in the park, it won't require too much out of a well thought out party.  Character planning and preparedness make the difficulty in my opinion, as starting battles differently will show you that a battle that you may have once thought very hard, can become very easy if starting it out thinking outside the box.  Picking up that oil barrel you saw way back, carrying and sneaking it into the middle of an enemy pack, sneaking out, and opening combat with that firescroll you have been saving since the beginning of the game is just one of the many ways you can make the game easier for yourself.                While the game rewards thinking in that aspect, one of my favourite things about this game so far is that it DOESN'T reward you traditionally.  A talent ""Pet-Pal"" will let you talk to animals, and you may expect that every animal you talk to should give you something in return, by nature of spending a hard-earned talent point on the ability.  While sometimes that may be the case, more-often than not you are rewarded with a thought-provoking sentiment from a creature that is just trying to survive in this crazy world.  Consoling and replacing an orphaned bear's parental figure, or trying to explain to a dog what death means won't give you EXP or skills, but will tweak your heart-strings and remind you that there is nothing you can't expect in this world that larian has created.                The story of this game is interesting, as it will be very different depending on who you are playing as, or who you are playing with.  6 Origin characters each have their own goals and will play the game according to their needs.  And even if you aren't playing as them, they will continue throughout the world trying to accomplish their unique goals.  And woe be to those that will stand in their way.  Will you help them or turn them against each other? Or pursuade them to join you?  Or use them to as a means to an end to find better treasure and kill them when their usefulness has run out?  The characters are vastly improved upon the first game and out of everything, this is the part of the game that is the most improved and the most exciting for fans of original sin.                The only thing I can reccommend to players both new and old is that you really try to do EVERYTHING.  If you think it may be possible, just try it out.  What does 10 points in telekenisis and a really heavy object look like over-top of the enemies head?  Sneaking Pacifist playthroughs?  A character that lights everything around them on fire, then has their fire spells reduced in cost because of them standing on fire, and having so much fire-resist that they are healed by standing in it?                  The replayability of this game is insane because there are too many viable options to discover and explore.  The best part about it all is that you can play with 3 other people and do it all together."

tisparta,6,3,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,104.5,"Been a huge of RPG but never got the fad of pen and paper RPGs... until Divinity. This game is absoltley brillant in ways it gives you freedom to approach to given situation in any way you can think of and still manages to keep everything story driven. Nothing ever feels misplaced in the world... the level of detail, it rivals the likes of Witcher 3 and Breath of the Wild. The combat is tough but fair and it rewards tactical thinking.. keep a stock of Oil Barrels for boss fight :)  And the music... well, I am listening to it on a loop while staring at the download progress of the update for the last two hours, so yea its pretty darn good."

Fire is eternal, just get use to the burn damage  Editing this review to be more serious and to encourage others to play this, but there is honestly no words to convey what is simply an actual work of art graphically, mechanically, art and graphically, character and storywise.  Sit in the mainmenu and let the opening theme drag you into the mood of the game. Start a fight and let the orchestra rise and hype you to fight dragons and demons, or a fistfight in a tavern gets even more roudy with the mixture of brass and string. start the character screen and listen to the origin stories of all the characters for your first game,  listening to the fully voiced professional voice actors lay the background for the Characters own subplots that string along with the main game(Lohse is awesome as is the Red Prince).  Start your game and enjoy every view, walk along beaches of ruined castles, explore though caves with ancient unknown ruins, walk through the massive capital of Rivellon And just get wrapped up as the story twists and turns its way through the mythical land of rivelon for almost 120 hours of straight story that i honestly lost track of time playing (alot of my time was spent playing offline) And the best part? Do it all again and its just as good. Me and 3 friends all made custom characters and we are doing it all again and its just as fun as when we first started, the game was made for the party of 4 aspect like a good D&D game with your best friends after school.  Even if the main story wears you out, the game offers a well thought out editor to make your own maps and campaigns to really bring that D&D experience back, or download a top rated campaign from the workshop, all while playing the soundtrack back on youtube on a playlist because that full orchestra really gets me  Normally games in the 40-50 price range turn me around but this game really shines in a time of half completed main industry titles and half‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•resells of RPGs, this game will bring back that experience of the golden age of game design when games were meant to be played and not sold. It deserves its overwhelmingly positive score, its nomination for RPG of the year despite being a PC only title as i was just that much loved by those who played it, and it deserves more people to play and love it just as me and my friends have.

Roger Feederer,204,3,0,"November 12, 2017",Recommended,42.8,"The true game of the year in 2017.  Hopefully the steam review system/tagging system gets this game to pop up on your store, because you probably won't hear about it from major outlets or podcasts.  I honestly thought turn based strategy had gone the way of XCOM.  Divinity, however, can be more readily compared to Dragon Age: Origins...only with more story, more character customization, interesting party members and fun yet challenging combat.  There's no need to experience any of the previous games (I didn't).  If you have ever enjoyed RPGs then play this game."
ÊâÄÊ¨≤ÈöèÂøÉ,34,3,0,"December 16, 2017",Recommended,48.9,"fun game, real high quality, one of the best RPGs I will say."
RainyDay,121,3,0,March 31,Recommended,129.6,"An absolutely incredible experience, without a doubt, one of the finest rpgs to date, it certainly is the best I‚Äôve ever played.  I wouldn‚Äôt know where to begin, the world is as interesting and alive as the long and beautifully crafted story, which stays strong for almost all of its entire 130h runtime.  If you‚Äôre new to rpgs, you might be put off by the inherent amount of lore and world building exposition these kinds of games often exhibit, but I must say that the game does a remarkable job of giving you all the information you need without overwhelming you. The world building is constant and just detailed enough as to make you want to fill in the details yourself using your own imagination.  Having not played the original Divinity Original Sin, I did not once feel like I was missing some important piece of lore or that I had missed out on anything story-wise, which is something I truly appreciate from the developers.  The writing is witty, fresh and fully voice acted. Not one person, monster or animal goes without a voice. The voice acting is also excellent, a pleasant surprise seeing how much has been had to be dubbed.  Combat is a lot of fun, and it only gets better the more you level up and are able to experiment with new interesting skills and combos; the only thing I feel could have been done better is how the different skill trees are explained. As it stands, only a very basic description is given, when important information, like that hydro spells are in the most part curative or that pyro spells focus more on damage should be explained somewhere. This is not such a major issue due to the fact that players are given the opportunity to respec at any time once they reach a certain point in the story (fairly early) , but still, it does make investing into certain trees a bit dangerous and daunting as a new player.  Overall, the game has provided me with a beautiful experience and I‚Äôm left reminiscing about my adventures in Rivellon alongside my memorable companions, thinking about what I could have done differently.  If you have even a passing interest in rpgs, try it, you won‚Äôt regret a second of it."

The world is detailed both in environment and lore, the characters are deep and nuanced, often troubled and frequently broken, yet richer for their vast flaws. The combat is pure turn based strategy, and while cheesable, can be quite difficult while rewarding smart tactics.  The story is enthralling, as are each of the dozens of side stories. I'm hesitant to label them quests, as I feel that would demean their stature in some way.  Finally, the sound track is amazing. So good in fact, that it won't stop playing on loop in my head, even when I wish it would because I've been up for 46 hours and please let me sleep.  10/10, will play again once I can convince a friend to get the game for a co-op playthrough."

IamKayoh,309,3,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,126.5,"This is the first review I'm writing for a video game on Steam in several thousands of hours logged across many titles. If you enjoy Pathfinder/DnD. Get this. Get it with a buddy if you can and you both go in blind. That's what I did and it has been the best gaming experience I have had since being a kid. I've audibly gasped, I've giggled like a kid. I've had some Ah ha! and some oh‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•... I want to include a small example as to why this game is an absolute must have and why it's so incredible to play with a friend.   Whatever you do, don't read any guides. Get lost, explore. Find neat‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Don't worry about your build or misspending points. I'm only level 7 on several play throughs but I have already mutated builds so suddenly in just a level or two it's not worth playing through the boat twenty times.   If you are planning on playing Divinity II do not read the next part. If you're on the fence, read the next part.     ****SMALL SPOILER AHEAD*****   There is a side quest early in the game involving what appears to be an undead/zombie man on a beach. My party decided to kill him before attempting anything else and we ended up with this sweet ring. The problem was, this ring belonged to a person that a Magister was looking for. Well‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• let's go talk to her and let her know this guy is dead. So we go talk to the Magister. Turns out this guy is her father. We tell her he's dead and looked super nasty. She asks for proof and the only proof we have is this ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing guys ring.   Let me pause for a moment. For this early on, this ring is like a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing cheat code. It gives magic armor, some other stat, but the big thing is that is let's the user cast restoration.   So the only way to advance the quest is to give her the ring, otherwise she thinks you're ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing with her to get her to leave her post. We decide we wanna see the event through, so I give up my precious and we follow her back to the beach where this Magister is losing her mind and crying over her undead (now dead) father's corpse. Clearly she's distraught, but I want that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing ring. She's not gonna give it up, it's her Dad's ring and he's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing dead and corrupted in front of her.  After getting caught attempting to pickpocket the ring which I still maintain is what literally every rogue-ish character would do in this situation, me and my friend found ourselves in combat with a Magister. My friend who has taken a starting level in necromancer starts laughing uncontrollably and we both watch as his little Dwarf named Opal raises the Magister's fathers body into a grotesque pile of gore, and then slaps the now distraught Magister in the face with her (un)undead father's intestines which then exploded into a cloud of viscera and splooge.   Seriously, get this game, get off the boat, and start exploring. Get creative, there's a lot you can do and many ways to do it.    "
TrumpKingsly,149,3,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,136.4,"This is an extremely deep, extremely interesting RPG (gameplay and narrative) that doesn't know how combat works and rushes the everloving Hell out of its ending.  The Narrative is Easily the Best Part of this Game The narrative is about power and servitude. A movie would typically tackle this subject using a protagonist and an antagonist in a singular case study. We'd form some kind of opinion on it after seing what goes down between those two people. Original Sin 2 is a 100+ hour videogame that tackles the subject using many protags and antags in many separate and different case studies and thought experiments. This means we form our opinion after seeing the power/servitude dynamic play out in a bunch of different contexts. It's really effective at helping the player form a rich opinion, by the time it's done.  But Combat and the Ending are Serious Sore Spots However, there are two jagged thorns stuck deep within the side of this game: combat difficulty and the story's ending. These thorns are so jagged, in fact, that I have a major doubt: the review outlets giving this a 10/10 probably didn't finish the game and probably played it on easy mode.  Combat encounters are each either so easy that none of your party even lose their armor, or they're actually impossible to win. There is no middle ground. When they're impossible, this is because the game cheats on behalf of your enemies. They get an astounding number of action points in a turn. They cast the same AoE decimator spell every single turn. They mind control your party through their magic armor. They're a mob, each member of which has infinite initiative, so they all go before your first party member has their turn. Or you make a certain ludicrous decision at the end game and you're faced with a 1v10 that gives you one move to kill everyone. Hilarious.  To win these impossible fights, you have to cheat. Save scum, obviously. But, beyond that, you have to reload, then position your party as if they're psychics--in ways you could not possibly have known would work before going into the fight the first time. Or, you have to destroy parts of the environment before stepping on that tile that triggers the fight. Or, you have to kill all the nurses in the Doctor's house before you go and talk to him. Cheat at this game. Become a save-scum psychic and leave your foes baffled at your god-like foresight.  And then there's the ending. The gameplay leading to the end is pretty cool. Some complicated puzzles, most of which are literally spelled out for you if you talk to everyone in the final zone. But at least one puzzle will remain unspoiled until you have to complete it.  Then, you get a huge boss fight full of cheating enemies that you win by the skin of your teeth. Almost all of those enemies are, as far as I can tell, the biggest narrative inconsistency in history. Then, the narrator gives you some boilerplate about ""remember all that stuff that happened in the game."" That is just barely a paraphrase of what he says. Character- and decision-specificity are at absolute 0 in that boilerplate. Then, he asks ""Remembering that stuff, what do you do?"" You pick one of three choices. I picked the first choice. ""Okay, so you picked the first choice. Now you get this thing. What do you do with it?"" Three more choices. You pick one and get 30-60 seconds of post-game cutscene featuring some vagary about a character that really didn't matter and an extremely brief summary of the way things stand after your decision.  And then you're done. Recently, Larian enabled playing after the endgame, so you're brought back to your base to finish side quests or otherwise derp about with your endgame loot. Here's the thing, though. 3/4 of my party died during the last fight. Never got a chance to res anyone. One of that 3/4 was the character I created at the start. So, another party member won the game. Only my created character goes back to base after the credits, and guess what? He's still dead, so I get a game over screen and am asked to reload the boss fight.  Nice.  Conclusion This game is extremely good. Addictive, even. It stands tall and proud above most other story-driven games I've ever played. Then, there are the ""challenging"" fights and the sloppy, heartless ending that easily hack off its legs at the knees. Overall, I recommend, because 125/126 hours being fantastic is a great thing. But, that hour of poor quality is a really, super important hour."

seanhogge,93,3,0,January 19,Recommended,97.6,"So you already know the game is good. Very positive reviews overall and recently. The devs are responsive and sensitive to the players, and it's one of the few Kickstarter projects that didn't seem to fall apart or leave everyone underwhelmed.  What I'd like to do is help you figure out what will leave you perfectly whelmed with this game.  TL;DR? It's tough to get into. I failed the first time. Experiment and mod, and you'll have a blast. The game won't keep you from fights way too tough for you. Just learn caution.  I started it maybe 18 months ago, got to the first town and quit in sort-of frustration. I had approached it all wrong. Maybe I can help others avoid the mistake. Here's what you'll need to know, I think.  This is a game of thought. The action is visceral and fun and frequent (unless you prefer it not to be), but even then you'll be most successful when you are deliberate and creative. Don't expect Dragon Age, this is more complex. Battles aren't about the amount of damage, they're about doing the right damage at the right time. You can see the action order, you can see weaknesses, you can chain things together.  The game is a challenge. Levels are significant. 4 level 10s vs 3 level 11s can be a genuinely tough fight when you're still learning mechanics and combos. Quicksave a lot. Just. Like, constantly. Trust me. It's exhilarating that any encounter can go either way, but you can easily get caught with your skivvies in the static cloud.  Don't be afraid to mod, even on your first play through. I came back after a few mods eased some annoyances and made the game slightly easier, but still a challenge. Just do whatever you need to experience the game, and don't listen to the magisters purists. The strength here is in the play, not the mechanical experience.  You can completely respec at any time, starting in Act 2. No mods needed, total freedom to move all your points. The only thing downside is that you'll have to spend money on skills if you go in a new direction. But even in Act 1, don't fret about getting every level-up right. Try wacky things.  Crafting isn't a chore. Once you know a recipe, you can just make it if you have the stuff. You can experiment like a graveyard debtor without penalty. You can ignore crafting altogether.  Leveling up, getting new equipment, and getting new skills all make an impact. All of them happen often enough that I feel like I'm more powerful in almost every fight. A single level opens up many new options. A new weapon is usually around the corner. A new skill is about to be revealed. Relish it, rookie.  Choices make a difference, not in a superficial way. But there's always a way around. Almost. If there isn't, then that's why you and I will have to play through again. I'm only in Act 2, but I already have a half-dozen things I'd like to see go a different way.  You can make mistakes. I killed a guy I needed because he got‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•that I kept asking the same question. So then I had to work around it. It was great. The devs have you, you can't get yourself into an unbeatable state, but ain't no one gonna slay the voidwoken in the closet for you. Also, if you have an undead, always check their coverings or disguise. Just sayin'. Poor townspersons.  Do you like ""gaming the game?"" Figuring out what's overpowered and exploiting it? Go for it! Me, I think that's as boring as a turtle's unrequited love laments, so if you're like me don't read a thing about min-maxing or party makeup. Just pick what you like and you can make it work and the work to do so won't be so bad because it's fun.  If you expect Diablo or Dragon Age, a one-best-way game or mindless distraction, this isn't it. I dig all of those, but this game isn't what I play to scratch those itches.  Oh, and teleport is a crazy useful skill. Make sure at least 1 person has it. FIN."
4sh1m,92,3,1,September 23,Recommended,84.9,"I'm going to be lazy and post exactly what I posted for D:OS1:  Unsure if extra reviews are needed. This game is a must, it is plain wonderful on all aspects. I cannot possibly imagine the amount of hours it took to fully design and develop this masterpiece. It is one of those games on Steam that put the others to shame. Can be enjoyed immensely alone and with friends. The music is out of this world."
RedZane,188,3,0,"November 7, 2017",Recommended,503.8,Never done a review but this game has rightfully earned a lot of praise.   I have played through the game entirely on tactian mode and can say this game has earned every bit of praise that people have put. I have spent (probably too many) hours on building a brand new character and running through a good portion on Fort Joy. The whole storyline is a amazing and the interactions between party members is on point.   The only complaint I have is that NPC's treat Fane as human until combat where the begin raining healing spells to his face as if they knew he was undead. Not a huge gripe and something you can generally ignore.

Do you enjoy being lost in a magical world where good and evil is not always apparent? Do you have 100 hours free time?  Look no further! This is a game for any and every RPG fan and then some. Its simple enough to jump in even if you are quite new to these sort of games but make no mistake, there is very little hand holding in this masterpiece. I felt a void after finishing the Witcher with all its DLCs and I was missing a game what sucks you in and keeps you engadged with more then just ""lootboxes"" and ranking lists to beat.

Nurse,650,3,0,January 15,Recommended,125.0,"My personal Review to Divinity: Original Sin 2 So, lets get this straight, this game is a master-piece.   It's a game like XCOM: Enemy Unkown its a game like The Witcher its a game like Dragon Age and many more...  Divinity is not for everyone, but it is for everyone who loves MMO/RPG/TBG Turn based game I try to be spoiler free, but i will include stuff in this review that is obvious.  Character Editor There are a few thing's that i want to talk about, mostly good. You can create your own char in this game, and it's not only for the look, it changes the gameplay for the entire game. There are a few races, Human's, Lizard's, Drawf's, Skeleton's, Elf's... Every Race has a unique talent, example: Elf's can eat body Part's and know what happened to them or what they thought about while they died, sound strange? Yes it is. But it help's you in-game to find hidden treasures or hidden quest's. Even the NPC's are reacting to your Gender/Race/Behavior.  You can choose your own Style, i dont mean hair, face, etc. i mean... how your char is reacting to things... example: I mad a Noble Lizard, that talk's like it has a stick up her‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I role-play her like she is a Annoying know-it-all.  This way, your story takes different out comes. So watch out what you pick.  The only thing that bugs me is, that i cant change how tall my char is, how the body looks... Also, some gear looks weird on the body of the chars, they look more fat in some of these, and some are way to skimpy.  There are also many trait's and Skills you can pick but thats too much to go in to... You just need to know one think... there is everything from the normal knight to cleric.  This might be a spoiler for an enemy in the game: Some races has permanent side effects.. like skeletons heal when they get poison damage, same with enemys Martin Looter King What can i say? There is a‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•tone of loot... i dont know how much and how different they are, but what i saw so far... simply -amazing-  I just noticed, here and there, some clothing and loot looks the same... different item stats, but what will you do with a such big game?  The Trading is very simple to use, easy to access, quick to understand.   Enemy's you face NPC's Sadly, this is the only point i am slighty disappointed, its not bad for me, but i think some people might notice very quickly, that there are not that many different enemy types. Yes there are plenty, but for the length of this game, it might get boring. I dont mean the fights, i mean the types, i go to the fights after this section...  Oh boy... the NPC's... Where do i start? Simply put, they all are very good written, +1 to the writer's. They never get boring, it feels like every NPC has a story... also, they all are voiced, but sometimes here and there, they dont speak, mostly for stuff like ""YOU THERE! You violated the law! Return your goods or serve your sentence!""  But still, its amazing how much time they put in to the voice acting... and the Narrator... gosh, very good job... you mostly hear his voice, he is describing EVERYTHING you see, smell, feel, do. Its truly amazing.  Sometimes you hear the same voice actor from another person... but this is not a biggy. They did the same in Oblivion, but i dont mind, some people do but not me, a simple little thing.   Multiplayer / Co-op / D&D Mode Alright, lets make this one short, There  is the PvP in alpha/beta, quite fun, then you are able to play the WHOLE Story with 3 others... other player. It's super fun, but i recommend to play with someone you know or to scream at... if you play with randoms... they attack the guard... many... times... its a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Sometimes people dont do that, but many do...  So now to the D&D section, Thats one of the best features the game can offer right next to the single-player. I recommend not to access the Game Master Mode, many spoilers there, enemy types, loot etc.  It's hard to describe, but all you need to know, its like a level editor, or like that one thing from Arma 3 Zeus mode. You can role Dice, you can possess NPC's you can do all kind of‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• But... you need to do all by your self. That means, no NPC's walking around, only you, moving people from A to b. Would be cool if they would add something like a Waypoint/patrol mode so people are walking around citys, taverns etc.   Battles, Fight's, What can you do SO, the main thing in divinity: Original Sin 2 is the battles, fights, etc.  I tried something harder then easy mode - died. You need some training in the beginning but you will find a way to deal with different enemy types and 'areas'.  By Area, i mean... You surrounding. There are some different types of 'things' laying around... Let's talk about the basic of the basic, Fire we all know it, we all hate it. You can ignite Oil with fire, you can throw oil at enemy's, you can burn an enemy and lead him in to a puddle of oil so they explode in a cool way. There are some other thinks like Water and wetness, combined with electricity... just try stuff... its super fun to combine these elements... you can also use magic to make it cursed ;)  My RatingAre there Physic's / Ragdoll in the game? - Yas How big is the map?                                   - Very big, much to explore How are the graphic's?                               - Very nice, smooth pleasent to watch people burn or acid away Fighting?                                                     - Very good, sometimes its too easy, sometimes its too hard, or just ged gud. Multiplayer?                                                - Everything works good, no disconnect stuff or lagging. Plenty of people are                                                                         playing this game Stuff to do?                                                 - Yas... A lot... you are not getting bored in this game... Replay potential?                                       - I think you could play this game like 30 times and you still wouldnt find everything in                                                this game, many secrets, many options, combine race/trait's and you will have a different out come Is it buy worthy? Yes! 100% but ONLY when you are a fan of TBG/MMO/RPG's video games. A few games as example:  XCOM: Enemy unknown Dragon Age The Witcher Mass EffectThere are just a hand full of good MMORPG's out there, and if you like turn based combat, then its the perfect game for you, you can waste so many hours in this game, finding the best way to solve problems without fighting. You coudl play this game for a long time just to find out what else is hidden in this game. Gather some friends, play D&D online master the dungeons together. When you search a game with 100% on Metacritics or 10/10 IGN- Would Burn again then... you found it. It cost a lot of money, but its worth it. I think this game was on Kickstarter once too, but just look at it... so much time and effort. If there is a game that's worth the money, it's this one."

I spent over 100 hours on the starting island of Fort Joy completely f*$#ing around and having a blast.  At one point, I collected/stole basically everything I could and just laughed or nodded in respect at the wordplay/detail in the descriptions of each item.  The people at Larian studios clearly put their heart and soul into this game.  I found such absurd ways to circumvent certain situations that I felt sure I'd broken the game... nope that's just Divinity 2, and it's beautiful how it all works together."

But for the first time I think a game came really close to it. The storytelling is a bit cliche, nothing surprising. However, the battles are quite challenging, interesting and varied and there is a LOT of content to keep you entertained for dozens of hours. Companions are great and add some great depth into the game. I hope this is a standard kept on RPGs now and with a better writting we will see better and better games.  Definitely worth buying full price."

This game shines where other games just brushes over. From the writing of dialogue to the extreme open endings of each story. Even just looking around will have you waste hours thanks to breathtaking environment.   Where there is good there must be bad. The bad thing about this game is the closer you get to the ending the more you want to start over. Nobody wants this game to end.  In the wake of companies disregarding single player games, DOS2 deserves the be the flame carrier for those experiences.   "

RainyDay,121,3,0,March 31,Recommended,129.6,"An absolutely incredible experience, without a doubt, one of the finest rpgs to date, it certainly is the best I‚Äôve ever played.  I wouldn‚Äôt know where to begin, the world is as interesting and alive as the long and beautifully crafted story, which stays strong for almost all of its entire 130h runtime.  If you‚Äôre new to rpgs, you might be put off by the inherent amount of lore and world building exposition these kinds of games often exhibit, but I must say that the game does a remarkable job of giving you all the information you need without overwhelming you. The world building is constant and just detailed enough as to make you want to fill in the details yourself using your own imagination.  Having not played the original Divinity Original Sin, I did not once feel like I was missing some important piece of lore or that I had missed out on anything story-wise, which is something I truly appreciate from the developers.  The writing is witty, fresh and fully voice acted. Not one person, monster or animal goes without a voice. The voice acting is also excellent, a pleasant surprise seeing how much has been had to be dubbed.  Combat is a lot of fun, and it only gets better the more you level up and are able to experiment with new interesting skills and combos; the only thing I feel could have been done better is how the different skill trees are explained. As it stands, only a very basic description is given, when important information, like that hydro spells are in the most part curative or that pyro spells focus more on damage should be explained somewhere. This is not such a major issue due to the fact that players are given the opportunity to respec at any time once they reach a certain point in the story (fairly early) , but still, it does make investing into certain trees a bit dangerous and daunting as a new player.  Overall, the game has provided me with a beautiful experience and I‚Äôm left reminiscing about my adventures in Rivellon alongside my memorable companions, thinking about what I could have done differently.  If you have even a passing interest in rpgs, try it, you won‚Äôt regret a second of it."

I have never been interested in them, but with all the praise this game has been receiving, I figured I would buy it to try it out. I have been thoroughly impressed with the quality and quantity of the game thus far, especially for the cheaper price tag. The level of complexity with the combat system and crafting is unmatched, I feel like I discover new ways to play the game every few minutes. It can be a difficult game, though that makes it so satisfying when you win a battle. The game doesn't hold your hand, and my friend started out feeling overwhelmed by what we could or couldn't do. The tactical decision making sort of reminds me of Dragon Age: Origins, though more in-depth by far.   Performance is pretty good, there isn't SLI support, though you probably won't need it. The game dropped frames significantly once when surrounded by fire, smoke, gas, and electricity in a high foliage area.   I fully recommend this game if you're even remotely on the fence about it, and I look forward to spending hundreds of hours mastering different classes. The savior of the RPG genre!"

Seth Knows,190,3,1,"November 10, 2017",Recommended,12.4,"Just a disclaimer, this is my first time playing this type of game. I have never been interested in them, but with all the praise this game has been receiving, I figured I would buy it to try it out. I have been thoroughly impressed with the quality and quantity of the game thus far, especially for the cheaper price tag. The level of complexity with the combat system and crafting is unmatched, I feel like I discover new ways to play the game every few minutes. It can be a difficult game, though that makes it so satisfying when you win a battle. The game doesn't hold your hand, and my friend started out feeling overwhelmed by what we could or couldn't do. The tactical decision making sort of reminds me of Dragon Age: Origins, though more in-depth by far.   Performance is pretty good, there isn't SLI support, though you probably won't need it. The game dropped frames significantly once when surrounded by fire, smoke, gas, and electricity in a high foliage area.   I fully recommend this game if you're even remotely on the fence about it, and I look forward to spending hundreds of hours mastering different classes. The savior of the RPG genre!"

Loden DarkStar,312,3,0,September 5,Recommended,119.3,"Divinity has always been a great fantasy IP from the first through the Dragon Knight saga and now in Original Sin.   I am not usually a big fan of turn based combat and that might give people cause to pause when considering this game, it did with me anyway .... dont let that stop you though.   This is a true role playing game something we see so very rarely these days, the turn based mechanic of the combat wont get in your way. In my experance any way the game's turn based mechancis wont adversly impact your enjoyment in any way, if anything you may find you like it if only in this specific case. As to the story, world and characters they are all master strokes through and through, the massive array of options and granular details to game give it huge replayability just in terms of the main campaign and the community have added a lot more via mods and scenarios. Put simply you will get your monies worth out of this game just from the stock content then on top of that you have a great community giving you even more via Workshop and Nexus.  Cons? Nothing really, while the game isn't perfect ... simply because nothing is ... there is nothing I would see changed about it that isn't a matter of personal taste and for thouse aspects of taste the community has that covered in mods e.g. difficulty rebalance, spell effects, rate of progression, etc."

calibrojosh10,393,4,0,January 27,Recommended,100.9,"What I liked:   Improves almost every aspect from the first game     The best combat system thus far     Voice acting (I didn‚Äôt play the updated original)     Story at some parts is amazing     Game designed with co-op and solo in a CRPG???!!?! What You Need to Know:   I played this game solo (#FOREVERALONE), even though having two copies from Kickstarting the game. I would love to play the game co-op to see the game how a great game is even better with a friend competing for how the game plays.      With that out of the way, I want to start with the story. It‚Äôs all over the place. I don‚Äôt remember the story from the first one and I‚Äôll probably forget most of this game too. The first 2 acts which is about 60 hours of the game and feels at times lackluster in terms of the pacing, with only the ending of each act being amazing mostly in terms of what it makes you fight. The last 3 acts each get more focused on the main quest and side quests that branch from it. The huge time sink in the game is how many side quests you get or prevent from completing if you kill everyone.      The game does favor heavily playing the good side as after watching the ending you get 30 seconds if choosing anything other than the good option with no details on anything other than world is screwed. You choose to be good; you get over 10 minutes of details about every character you helped, companions, and the entire world in way more detail. I usually play the hero and help anyone I can and accidently picked the wrong option as it I thought it was the good choice. The whole tone at the end, is based on this final pick regardless of what you do in the rest of the game. So no matter how you play pick the good ending so you can hear your story.  The players you create can be just random dude that is standard with most RPG‚Äôs. I decided to play as the undead guy because I got the collector‚Äôs edition and he‚Äôs the statue you get, so why not. I‚Äôve never played as an undead which heals from poison, hurt from normal healing, as well as agro npc if you get naked, lol. With these premade characters of 6, they allow you get a quest for yourself and for each companion you bring along. You can also play as undead of any race too. So you get options bro.      The combat improves from the first one with two armors that while up prevents the major status effects that previously was percentage and more chanced based. I like this move to prevent save scumming for effects. You have battles taking place in areas that have verticality that can extend or block skills as well as increase or decrease damage based on the height. You have everything from the first one that I love with over one hundred skills that each have a purpose since you have elements playing a role. You get curse and blessed variants on each element. What I‚Äôm trying to say is the combat is by far my favorite so far. I‚Äôm loving turned based combat more and more with each game I play.      The game scales loot you find in the world but not quests as they are static, this saddens completing quests that are levels below you as the reward sucks. The AI you fight feels at times cheating as they never attacked my undead character with poison ever and always knew what elements are my weakness and feel like they know everything regardless of level or enemy type. This does make the game more difficult but actually plays like a real person would. I never got the feeling of laughing once at a stupid enemy messing up and healing my dude. Also when my characters are charmed they always do the dumbest stuff and use all my potions and scrolls, this was actually funny to watch and always had more than they could use. I do know the AI being too smart can be modded to feel more artificial if you don‚Äôt like that feature.       My biggest gripe is the interface to shift items around characters and when crafting no search option. This is so freaking stupid, with efforts put into teleporting items to relevant characters when needed for actions to save tedious shifting items; they forgot that when you pick up everything, I have a lot of crap sort to which player to give to. This is tedious when doing by item. Let us set items to go to certain players that use those items like arrows, grenades, and armor. So much time is wasted sorting and finding out who needs what item. Also crafting when you have hundreds of materials is hard to find the one you need. Dear god this was annoying at times. Not enough to‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•me off, but enough to annoy me.      Crafting is no longer a skill to put points into; you learn recipes and anyone can craft them. This sounds nice but I never really crafted until the end to prepare for the last fight. So that feature felt lackluster compared to the first game.       Overall the game is another instant classic just like the original. You don‚Äôt have to play the first one to understand this one. The combat has so much depth in it and was the main draw for me and did not disappoint. The story overall only felt epic at ends of each act with some fun side quests, especially the animal ones. I love the pet pal talent. All the major side quests had satisfying endings and I can‚Äôt wait for a 3rd game. These devs have made me to understand why old school RPG‚Äôs are the best and can‚Äôt go back to shallow ones anymore. Thanks Larian Studios for showing me da wae of CRPG‚Äôs as I‚Äôm still new to the genre, as to why I don‚Äôt have much recommendations.    My Score: A+ Paid: $135 Completed in: 90 hours  Games similar I recommend:   Magicka  ( pure magic combat)     UnderRail ( has some flaws)    Pillars of Eternity 2  (Haven‚Äôt played either game yet. Looking forward to them) "

I must admit I was disapointed after few playing hours to realize RPG content isnt as deeply as classic aD&D games and Builder very different of what I hoped with a just succession of very small maps.   If you got in your group someone who speaks with animals, have good persuasion and wits scores, with only DamageDealers you're sure you'll miss nothing and progress easely : quests are interesting but dont need any analysis or long searchs, no mortal traps anywhere, no oneshots (maybe with Alice or missing in making Hannag one of your friends), no wipes (except being too optimistic with Adrahmalihk), quite nothing to detect, quite nothing to miss anywhere (Braccus legs ?) and finaly a hardest difficulty mode ""too soft"" for most of players.  So... how explain our actual 600hours on DOS2 HM with many diff√©rent groups and choices (magical, physical, distants, ranges, with  tank, with only DD, 2 lonewolves, wipe maps in genocides, or pacifist ""just alone"") ? For me the biggest quality of this game isnt RPG at all but by-turn-combat options and strategies, with many different builds choices and mix for each member. Every tactical/HM combat is a +/- complex arena where you must analyze options and ways to success. Concerning GameMastering Leaks are finaly forces : this part of game must be seen as a way to play exactly the way you RPG-play around a table, and not to create a big scripted world like with Aurora (NeverwinterNights).   Except minor changes in menus, dialogs, a global easier game (...), a new strange corpses ragdoll animation and a bigger game folder, sorry to see DefinityEdition bringing nothing more. But DOS2 is one of the most dynamic and interesting games I played with friends for many years."

Domush,119,4,0,"June 2, 2017",Recommended,116.1,"Easily one of the best RPG's I've ever played, and it's still in Alpha. Superb!  My only gripe (and it's a HUGE gripe!) is the uber-confusing dialog.   It's all written in the third person, so you can't tell if the dialog means 'you' (as in your character who is speaking/acting/thinking) or 'you' (as in the character they are speaking to).   WTF? It's ROLE PLAYING! Make the dialog 1st person!  Example dialog:  (and yes, every selection is enclosed in asterisks for no reason.. no dialog quotes anywhere in the game)  1: *you ask what do you have to do* - Am I asking what I have to do? What the other person has to do?  2: *you demand to let your sword go* - Let my sword go? Let your sword go?  3: *you look puzzled* - Am I looking puzzled as an action? I am saying they look puzzled?   4: *you wonder why the dialog is all in 3rd person, since you can barely tell what's a thought or action or what's actually said out loud (and to whom)*   5: *you facepalm at the ridiculousness of it all; you don't know who 'you' is referring to*  Other than that, it's a wonderful game. Of course, the dialog is 1/3 of the entire game, so that's a MAJOR issue.  Also, the dialog was written by a non-native english speaker. It's obvious, and slightly irritating since, beyond the above issue, there are some dialog options which make no sense whatsoever, yet can mean the difference between your character living and dying in the game.  Example: NARRATOR: *you see a runed vase with an inscription warning you to not pull the lever unless you have fund scrolls to tell* (and yes, all descriptions come in the form of dialog with a pretend person named ""NARRATOR"", instead of just describing the scene in a normal way. Very hokey, and a constant immersion killer.)  1: *you pull the lever, confident you are ready* 2: *you break the vase* 3: *you open the vase and absorb the entity inside*  Wait.. What?! WTF does ""have fund scrolls to tell"" mean? Which optin shold I be choosing? How do I back out? PS: You can't back out of dialog, so you MUST make a choice. Your guess is as good as mine what the non-english part is supposed to mean, but the rest of the game is decided in that moment and there are no take-backs.  So, yeah, awesome, awesome game, with the most ridiculous dialog/narration I've ever seen."

calibrojosh10,393,4,0,January 27,Recommended,100.9,"What I liked:   Improves almost every aspect from the first game     The best combat system thus far     Voice acting (I didn‚Äôt play the updated original)     Story at some parts is amazing     Game designed with co-op and solo in a CRPG???!!?! What You Need to Know:   I played this game solo (#FOREVERALONE), even though having two copies from Kickstarting the game. I would love to play the game co-op to see the game how a great game is even better with a friend competing for how the game plays.      With that out of the way, I want to start with the story. It‚Äôs all over the place. I don‚Äôt remember the story from the first one and I‚Äôll probably forget most of this game too. The first 2 acts which is about 60 hours of the game and feels at times lackluster in terms of the pacing, with only the ending of each act being amazing mostly in terms of what it makes you fight. The last 3 acts each get more focused on the main quest and side quests that branch from it. The huge time sink in the game is how many side quests you get or prevent from completing if you kill everyone.      The game does favor heavily playing the good side as after watching the ending you get 30 seconds if choosing anything other than the good option with no details on anything other than world is screwed. You choose to be good; you get over 10 minutes of details about every character you helped, companions, and the entire world in way more detail. I usually play the hero and help anyone I can and accidently picked the wrong option as it I thought it was the good choice. The whole tone at the end, is based on this final pick regardless of what you do in the rest of the game. So no matter how you play pick the good ending so you can hear your story.  The players you create can be just random dude that is standard with most RPG‚Äôs. I decided to play as the undead guy because I got the collector‚Äôs edition and he‚Äôs the statue you get, so why not. I‚Äôve never played as an undead which heals from poison, hurt from normal healing, as well as agro npc if you get naked, lol. With these premade characters of 6, they allow you get a quest for yourself and for each companion you bring along. You can also play as undead of any race too. So you get options bro.      The combat improves from the first one with two armors that while up prevents the major status effects that previously was percentage and more chanced based. I like this move to prevent save scumming for effects. You have battles taking place in areas that have verticality that can extend or block skills as well as increase or decrease damage based on the height. You have everything from the first one that I love with over one hundred skills that each have a purpose since you have elements playing a role. You get curse and blessed variants on each element. What I‚Äôm trying to say is the combat is by far my favorite so far. I‚Äôm loving turned based combat more and more with each game I play.      The game scales loot you find in the world but not quests as they are static, this saddens completing quests that are levels below you as the reward sucks. The AI you fight feels at times cheating as they never attacked my undead character with poison ever and always knew what elements are my weakness and feel like they know everything regardless of level or enemy type. This does make the game more difficult but actually plays like a real person would. I never got the feeling of laughing once at a stupid enemy messing up and healing my dude. Also when my characters are charmed they always do the dumbest stuff and use all my potions and scrolls, this was actually funny to watch and always had more than they could use. I do know the AI being too smart can be modded to feel more artificial if you don‚Äôt like that feature.       My biggest gripe is the interface to shift items around characters and when crafting no search option. This is so freaking stupid, with efforts put into teleporting items to relevant characters when needed for actions to save tedious shifting items; they forgot that when you pick up everything, I have a lot of crap sort to which player to give to. This is tedious when doing by item. Let us set items to go to certain players that use those items like arrows, grenades, and armor. So much time is wasted sorting and finding out who needs what item. Also crafting when you have hundreds of materials is hard to find the one you need. Dear god this was annoying at times. Not enough to‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•me off, but enough to annoy me.      Crafting is no longer a skill to put points into; you learn recipes and anyone can craft them. This sounds nice but I never really crafted until the end to prepare for the last fight. So that feature felt lackluster compared to the first game.       Overall the game is another instant classic just like the original. You don‚Äôt have to play the first one to understand this one. The combat has so much depth in it and was the main draw for me and did not disappoint. The story overall only felt epic at ends of each act with some fun side quests, especially the animal ones. I love the pet pal talent. All the major side quests had satisfying endings and I can‚Äôt wait for a 3rd game. These devs have made me to understand why old school RPG‚Äôs are the best and can‚Äôt go back to shallow ones anymore. Thanks Larian Studios for showing me da wae of CRPG‚Äôs as I‚Äôm still new to the genre, as to why I don‚Äôt have much recommendations.    My Score: A+ Paid: $135 Completed in: 90 hours  Games similar I recommend:   Magicka  ( pure magic combat)     UnderRail ( has some flaws)    Pillars of Eternity 2  (Haven‚Äôt played either game yet. Looking forward to them) "

People here have already given descriptions left and right in their reviews, I've very little to add to that. Sufficed to say that where Larian's Original Sin (1) was already a very good game, but had minor nuisances here and there, this one, at fricking Early Access Alpha, already felt, looked, and played like a true AAA title. Everything that was in Original Sin has been improved many fold, all the flaws and nuisances fixed, all the good things perfected, and so, so much more added on top. So much so, that I'd have to write a novel to cover it all.  The age of RPG's - in my opinion - has been in decline for a good 10 years with previous big players like BioWare and Bethesda being stuck, even backtracking in their production of quality games. CD Projekt Red managed to start a new evolution of AAA RPG titles with its brilliant Witcher 3, but has so far seen no even remotely serious competition. Now, having played Original Sin 2, it's blatantly obvious that barring some extremely unlikely U-turns in the full release, Larian Studios will be cementing its position as the latest Gold producer with Midas' touch.  The overwhelmingly positive reviews in Steam and everywhere else are not a coincidence, as it's easy to see that this game will be a BIG deal. It's quite simply that insanely good."

I saw the game grow from within the kickstartes, I saw Swens comments on the changes, it all looked and felt so good. For backers they had some polls on what we wanted them to focus on. And, by Jove, did they pull our requests off. This game is awesome, storywise, gameplaywise, sound&musicwise,... (image a ton of more wises ;-) )If you are into RPG's, play this game! Take your time to explore it all, take your time for several replays of the game because the world is so open yo have so many opportunities you do not get all quests, storylines, characterdevelopments in one playthrough! Invest in this game and let the times pass, it will be next year before you know it. Before I forget it, this game can even be played in co-op (up to 4 players), what else do you need (maybe some beer, chips and a girlfriend, but that's not important now) For d&d fans they even implemented a game master mode (with one d&d campaign already worked out for your party!) to make sure you will never ever have to play the same story.

For 33 USD (For the deluxe edition), this game offers a lot more than most AAA titles in the past months, or even years. This review is here to hopefully show you how much you NEED this game. (Note: Not all the games content is able to fit into one review, so I will try to keep this as short as possible.)                                                     DIVINITY: ORIGINAL SIN 2 Review (Spoilers Ahead)   Story:  I have played a few modern  RPGs in my life. Mass Effect, Dragon Age, SWOTR, Skyrim, Fallout, Phantasy Star, Final Fantasy, but none of them really hold a candle to how much content and diversity this game contains. The story itself is continued after the events of Original Sin, but taake place hundreds of years after, meaning that there is no need to play the original to know what happens here. You play as a Sourcerer, a being able to tap into the misterious Source to use powers that are deemed too dangerous for the public.   I won't go too in detail on that, but from there, your journey begins. When I say ""your"" I don't really mean JUST your character that you made for the game, but YOU as well. This game makes YOU an integral part of the story, not just your character. You can traverse the world and do whatever you want.   The best part of the story is that it is non-linear. Hell, the entire game isn't linear, but I'll get to that. Any and EVERY choice that you make has an impact on, not just the story itself, but the lives of everybody around you, and it shows. The story can be played hundreds of times and still feel fresh. Different ""tags"" that you get/use (talked about in character customization) allow you to interact with people differently. What race you choose also makes a huge impact on how characters interact with you.   In this game, there are 6 different ""origin characters"" that allow you to experience their story through their point of view. I haven't done this myself (having only 38 hours into the game at the time of this review) but it is interesting to see the world through their eyes. If you don't want to, you can always use your own character and recruit them as ""allies.""  Note that in this game, your companions stories play out alongside yours. Choices will have to be made. Thats all I'm saying about that.  This game also allows for friends to enter your game alongside you. Many different things can happen, and you may end up fighting each other if you decide against it.   Quests can be found anywhere, especially NPC's. Depending on your choices however, they may be harsher to you, or maybe even not give you the quest in the first place.    Character Customizations:  This is arguably the least amazing thing in the game, which is saying something because it is still better than most other RPG creation systems. You can customize anything from a persons style, to their tags (which are sort of like occupations, which affect the story and dialogue.) It is here that you can also choose what class you are going to be. I won't go into too much detail, but know that choosing a class doesn't mean that you stay that class forever. You can spec your character into whatever class you want. One should note however that your beginning weapon is determined by your class.  You can also choose your atributes and skills in this section. Note that these affect your beginning character, and possibly your end game character if you stay on the road that you started.    Combat:  The flexibility of the story applies to combat as well. There are dmany different skills that you can choose from, which can be learned using books. Note that it is impossible to learn a skill if you don't have the right stats for it. There are many different ways a battle can go.. especially since the AI is good on higher difficulties.   There are different elements that can be used to your advantage. These elements give different debuffs to your oponents, but not all of them are effective as there are resistances. With the introduction of Divinity Original Sin 2 comes armor. These values are found on top of the health bar, and they serve the purpose of negating any and all debuffs, so you need to take care of that first.   In this game, you might notice some elements on the ground. If you happen to hit it either with a skill or basic attack, it turns into something different. For example, if an enemy is standing on a pudddle, you can use an electricity skill to stun them and cause them to lose a turn. Or, if they are standing on oil, using fire would cause an explosion, dealing damage as well as DOT. The possibilities are endless.   The only limit to combat is how many action points you have. This can be increased with the use of armor and skills, but I won't get too into that.    Music/Voice Acting:  For a game that almost didn't have voice acting, it is done pretty damn well. Every character is fully voiced. With a certain perk that even allows you to talk to and get quests from animals. Its 100% amazing. Over 1,000,000 lines of dialogue was recorded for this game, and each one really pushes the game along  The music is superb. Both thematic and atmospheric, it really helps immerse you in the world of Divinity. You can even choose which of 4 instruments will be playing during the game. It is amazing.   Mods and Downloads:  Aside from all of this content, Larian has decided that this game needed mods. They also allowed players to make their own stories using the ingame assets, which, for a 33 dollar game is astounding. While I would say that mods and downloads aren't NEEDED for the game to be amazing, it really adds to the replayability of the game as a whole. Note that using mods will disable achievements for the game, so you achievement hunters out there will need to play without them.   Multiplayer:  Sometimes, it gets a little lonely, so playing with friends is an option, and in my opinion, a MUST TRY. You can play with up to 4 players online, and 2 on split screen (YES THERE IS SPLITSCREEN.) They can help you do many things... of which I shouldn't spoil. You can even sabotage them when fighting, and you can even initiate PVP with them.   Speaking of PVP, there is a designated area for such, where you team up with others in order for you to kill your oponents. I haven't played the game mode myself, but it does look fun.    Closing Thoughts:  BUY THIS ALREADY. "

Mr Mojorisin,117,4,0,"December 21, 2016",Recommended,192.1,"The game is pretty great so far - highly recommended. I just finished the first Original Sin and the second seems to only improve upon all aspects (minus some of the character personality trait stuff that I hope theyt bring back). Visuals are much more appealing - I feel much more drawn in to each area I explore and combat retains the strategic elements that made the first so enjoyable (ie spending an hour to line up my ability because I saw it flash red for a second and im not spending another AP to step forward, damnit). I can't remember if there is a difficulty setting but whatever I had it on before a recent update invalidated all my save files was pretty challenging (frequent and large updates make it kinda pointless to sink too many hours into the game at this point, even though they give you the old builds so you can still play old saves). I really can't wait for this to be completed. I just hope they bring back all the excellent voice work for the second. There was so much great dialogue in the first - every animal voiced, every person had something to say and it never felt annoying. The dialogue style is set up differently from the first (characters talk to you as a player rather than to the source hunter) which may mean that voice acting isnt coming for your characters...?

Heck, many aspects of the game are already moddable, though obviously it'd be a bit silly to mod an alpha.  Barring a large drop in quality in the later acts (extremely unlikely), this will probably be an instant classic with amazing RPG gameplay that far surpasses its predecessor in narrative quality.  I will say Larian could be a bit more generous with more skills for us to play with in the alpha, but let me tell you, from what I've seen, there are going to be a LOT more cool skills in the final release. ;) "
twitch.tv/nickbanner,363,4,0,"December 22, 2017",Recommended,104.2,This game is proof that there is life after Baldur's Gate 2.   Seriously the best isometric RPG that came out in many many years.
Zubal025,196,4,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,400.9,"Best RPG ever in my honest opinion. ""This game has crazy depth and just really solid turnbase combat. Not to mention the mods (with a provided mod tool to make your own). People can make and upload there own campaign providing endless game content. More then this there is a dungeons master mode that is really solid and allows the DM to make modifications on the fly. Add in controller solid controller support as well as split screen Co-op (up to 2 people for one PC) and 4 player online Co-op AND competitive questing (yes there are multiple, conflicting paths to take in completeing a quest and two or more players can take directly opposing routes in those quests therefore competeing against each other) I do not see how you can not at least respect this game and its developers. This is DnD the video game more so then any other game that I have ever been aware of. A must buy for any RPG or DnD fan in my opinion."

I must admit I was disapointed after few playing hours to realize RPG content isnt as deeply as classic aD&D games and Builder very different of what I hoped with a just succession of very small maps.   If you got in your group someone who speaks with animals, have good persuasion and wits scores, with only DamageDealers you're sure you'll miss nothing and progress easely : quests are interesting but dont need any analysis or long searchs, no mortal traps anywhere, no oneshots (maybe with Alice or missing in making Hannag one of your friends), no wipes (except being too optimistic with Adrahmalihk), quite nothing to detect, quite nothing to miss anywhere (Braccus legs ?) and finaly a hardest difficulty mode ""too soft"" for most of players.  So... how explain our actual 600hours on DOS2 HM with many diff√©rent groups and choices (magical, physical, distants, ranges, with  tank, with only DD, 2 lonewolves, wipe maps in genocides, or pacifist ""just alone"") ? For me the biggest quality of this game isnt RPG at all but by-turn-combat options and strategies, with many different builds choices and mix for each member. Every tactical/HM combat is a +/- complex arena where you must analyze options and ways to success. Concerning GameMastering Leaks are finaly forces : this part of game must be seen as a way to play exactly the way you RPG-play around a table, and not to create a big scripted world like with Aurora (NeverwinterNights).   Except minor changes in menus, dialogs, a global easier game (...), a new strange corpses ragdoll animation and a bigger game folder, sorry to see DefinityEdition bringing nothing more. But DOS2 is one of the most dynamic and interesting games I played with friends for many years."

Hands down one of the best RPG's since Hello Kitty: Island Adventurer.  For the price it seriously doesn't get any better than this.  I sat on it for awhile thinking about if I should get it.

SOPMOD Musket,463,4,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,195.5,"Pretty good so far.  Its only in early access but I am impressed from what I see so far.  The combat seems more enjoyable, especially if you make a super tank class.  In DOS1 being a straight tank would require you to use your whole first turn just to walk over to the enemy since you were so weighed down with armor.  With there being fewer action points, it almost seems like you can do more.  Some things in game are still locked off, like the ability to change starting skills, but its still fun.    If you are unsure whether to get this game or not, since you have not played the first game, BUY THE FIRST GAME and try that out since it is only $20 now.  If you dont enjoy how that games mechanics are, you probablt will not enjoy this one."

The Big Alex,104,2,0,January 22,Recommended,59.4,"Finally we, the human race have been blessed with Larian Studios. Those guys really understand what makes a RPG game good and the Turn-Based twang just fits the game perfectly. The game looks very good and has a good artistic vision that takes a lot from the classic such as Baldurs Gate or Dungeon Siege but elevates it to this heavenly tier.  Customization is top notch, it feels like you can make your character from scratch however you want - Larian Studios understand that giving the power to the player and making him play like he wants is a good choice unlike trash devs like Ubisoft or EA.   Story might be the only weak spot of the game. While very rich it feels like we, a player, are jump cutting through scene to scene to scene without proper introduction which may feel kinda underwhelming. Also not fully knowing the villain of the game doesn't play to it's strength - because main villain isn't as mysterious as one might want.  Combat is good but not amazing. Definitely an improvement from previous installment but not perfect. Combat seems to be very hard at the beggining of the game but as you start getting more abilities, synergies and items it becomes easy even on hardest difficulties.   Despite that this game really shows that slower RPGs can be successful if there isn't a retard in front of the wheel and Larian executes this with sugeon precision. 7-8/10"
¬ø,315,2,0,May 4,Recommended,150.3,"It is pretty uncommon that I write reviews, and I will preface that when I played this game it was much much closer to its release date.   This game is utterly amazing, that is not to say there are negatives (I will have a bullet point pros con list at the bottom of this review), but it did not take long for me to think of this game as one of my favorite RPG games ever made. I think of this game as a modern day baulders gate. It has great story, its sound tracks are amazing, combat is diverse and enjoyable. Multiplayer was done Superbly.  Now if you are thinking about getting this game, a here are a few things you should know before purchase. Combat is turnbased, if you do not like turnbased games you may not like this games (especially because it is not a cheap game). DO NOT play honor mode if you have yet to beat the game yet (its a mode that if your party all dies your ONLY save gets deleted, and the fights are at the hardest difficulty level), the triggers for this are NOT common, however there are traps that will instantly kill folk around them, Which I walked into all of them. Restarting your entire game because of a trap like that will drive you insane.    Agian I played back closer to release but, when I played there were a fair amount of bugs in the game. This game easily makes up for it, but the bugs do exsist. At certian points in the game you may be unsure what quest you should do next. (Now if you are playing normal mode this may not affect you like it did me, because I was playing a harder difficulty setting, and I needed ot make sure I was not fighting things higher level than my self) Because if you plan to follow the monster levels and have them be equal to yours, it requires you to jump around the map alot finding out what quest areas are your level (unless of course you look up a guide, i would advise agianst that).  The 2nd act? (third map its a island), I was not too fond of this area, and I think it will most likely be most peoples least favorite spot, there are some dry moments, just take it slow and get through it this game has some really cool suprises for you.  Also dont take lone wolf as a perk unless you want to ruin the game, its the closest thing to a cheat code in that game I know of, you can pretty much breeze through the game on hardest difficulty if you use it.   TLDR: Pros Cons List.  Pros -Great Story -Great Music -Well Balanced Combat / Enjoyable Combat -Cool Cast of characters -Good leveling system -Good multiplayer Setup -Waypoint system making map travel easier  Cons -Quest order can be confusing at times -Island map is a little dry at times  if you saw a video of this game, and liked the top down aesthetic, and understand this is a RPG, I would 10/10 rate this game for you, you should buy and play it you wont regret it."

JimmyWolf,731,2,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,95.8,"I'm 20 hours in, playing with the same friend I played all the way through Divinity: Original Sin with.  We love that we're back in this world. It's beautiful, exceptionally well crafted and an exciting experience.  Combat is even more expansive than before, mixing the ideas that were so successful in the first game (use of elemental surfaces and spells) with new ideas such as the addition of an armour system for both magic and physical damage. This is something of a double edged sword though, on the one hand the armour system makes combat a really interesting dynamic of carefully choosing opponents based on whether their magic or physical armour is higher, what resistances they have and so on, but outside of the combat, the armour system makes traps completely devoid of threat as their effects will not breach your naturally regenerating armour. Whereas in the first game suddenly being hit by a fire trap would send on a quick jump to your hotbar to prepare a Rain spell or healing, now you just walk on without an issue.  We've deliberately avoided choosing the characters with origin stories as we're looking to focus on the main story and avoid the party dynamics that the game has. These characters can leave if they dislike the choices you make, which I fully support as a choice by Larian, but it's something to bear in mind when building your party at the start.   One thing that definitely amazes me is the full voice-acting. Thats a huge amount of work, especially as the Narrator is fully voiced as well. Well done to Larian, that must have taken an enormous amount of work, but it really adds to the world and to the immersion.  The only thing we miss is the music from the first game. Larian cannot be blamed for this, as the composer for the first game passed away but his music was exceptional and an extremely high bar to match. The music this time round feels too quiet pretty much all the time even at full volume and if we find a mod that adds the music from the first game we'll be grabbing that as soon as possible.  So far, 9/10, the only issues being the music and gameplay niggles that sometimes break an otherwise amazingly immersive experience"

Alariq,278,2,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,65.9,"Yes, I would reccomend this game. Is it the best thing since the invention of pizza since people are claiming? Not really.  The Good:  - Very Pretty Graphics / Reasonably optimized - Great Customization - Fully voiced, great overall quality of acting - Good world building and lore, main story can be a bit convoluted at times. - Reasonably Balanced  The Bad:  - I'm not very fond of a couple of combat systems. I think they have overdone the surface system. Every combat , even the tiniest ones end up a swirling chaos of destruction everywhere with burning/poison/shock/blood what have you everywhere. - Mobs instantly spawn on conveniently placed vantage points to harass you all the time. It's less about organic fights and more like forcing you to reload because you were exploring and not ready for a fight to spawn from thin air. This kinda creates the feeliing that the game is bending the rules against you, cheapening the experience overall. - Mediocre tutorial overall. Fails to tell you some key details like Lizards don't need shovels and skeletons don't need lockpicks. - Some bugs, like only half you party entering combat while the other half watches. You have to manually move your characters into combat, even though they are right there in the first place.  All in all, if you're a fan of CRPGs you'll likely enjoy this as I have. but, if you're new to the genre, there are more friendly places to start."

Blood-Lord,119,2,0,"September 23, 2016",Recommended,170.0,"I don't normally prepurchase video games. However, for Larian Studios which created a fantastic game in Divinity: Original Sin I will gladly support this game as well.  Rock, Paper, Scissors: The game play seems close to the original, with minor tweaks and additional combat strategies to worry about. The one thing I've noticed that was missing is where is the rock, papers, and scissors argument from the first game? I loved disagreeing with my friends and having to do this mini game.  From what I can tell the game play feels smoother, looks crisper and the amount of details that they've added to the game. I feel like what ever I do might have repercussions through out the game. Also, they seemed to have created multiple ways of completeing quests, or taking different routes to do the same job.   Source:  I understand that source spending spells are much more powerful than non-source spending spells. However, I believe after even 1 play through gathering source will become tedious and cumbersome. There needs to be a better way to gather this resource than swapping a wand/item with vamperism among the players.  Source solution?: I would like to note that doing this to the dead bodies is very enjoyable. It makes the game that much more immerism. Not sure how to improve upon this to make it more efficent? Maybe devour all sourcible dead bodies around you with one spell cast? However, only the number of source points that you're missing. This will keep the immerism of the spell, yet make gathering this material that much faster.   Source Soul Jars: Side note on the source resource. If you're able to suck source from the undead with an item. Whats the significance of stealing the souls from those stuck in a jar? Aren't these source captures suppose to be more potent or have more of a permanent touch to the character? From absorbing these souls you're loosing out on experience and possibly dialog with characters in this world.  These should be rare and have an additional progress to the characters in their own way. Maybe such as leadership adds bounses to the character. Doing this will add minior bounces to the character who devoured the soul. Bracchus Rex was doing things similar to this and became extremely powerful. Why can't we?  Also, doing this should reduce your attitude towards people to balance this out. #DarksideFTW :D  Act 1 Final Battle: Most encounters in the first act I had no problem. I understand that this game takes tactical placement, and combat very serious. Which is why I love games like this. Admittedly I am no fool when it comes to games like this. However, I would like to address the final battle of act 1. I believe this battle to not be challenging... Just way over powered to the players level and gear.   My friend and I were level 8 with all the quests, and gear that we could get from this island. However, when we got to this it was like hitting a giant wall. Took us around 2-3 hours to complete this battle with numerious amounts of tactics. Finally, I gathered the idea of getting all the explosive oil/ooze barrels on the island that remained and blow Alex and the worm to hell.  Here is a screenshot of what we did to kill the bastard.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769604881   Bug Dwarf Height: While going to Bracchus Rex's castle theres a part where you need to touch a gargoyle head to go through a portal. While doing this our dwarf in the party wasn't able to reach this gargoyle. Heres a screen shot of that below  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769608678   Arena Dead but Still Kicking Bug: After doing the arena and loosing to my friend. I was killed, but immediately revived going back to the arena master. My walking animation looked like I was dead, but still moving. Heres a screen shots of that below.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769176176 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769176554   Overall, if you enjoy turn based, rpg, in depth tactical combat with a very in depth storyline and involvement. This is the game for you!  P.S: This review is bound to change if I think of anything else to add."

tigran_petrosjan,42,2,0,"August 26, 2017",Recommended,875.2,"This game has the potential to become a masterpiece. It has all the strenghts of the first game`s Enhanced Edition, offers turn-based combat and plenty elemental interactions (make it rain, aoe stun through blitz bolt - create a fire surface, throw poison onto it for a huge explosion etc.). You can play with up to four party members and can either create your own character or take one of the four (after full release six) pre-made characters. While the first game lacked in the story, this 2nd part is much better in this regard. It has a much darker tone and so far the story delivers fully. It is grim, entertaining and really complex. Also the possibility of party dialogue and getting different results when talking with different party members to certain NPCs enlagerns its richness in this regard. But the strogest point of Divinity Origial Sin has always been its combat system. And the second part adds more features to that and makes everything even better. You now have aroumr fore physical and magic damage, which you have to break first in order to inflict status elements like stunned or burning or knocked down. Also there is a height system now, that your ranged characters can use for greater range and more damage.  And last but not least the game has after the full release on the 14th of September a Game Master Mode. There you can basically develop and play your own adventures with the Divinity engine and UI. With this you can create your own D&D - campaign and play it with your friends.  Another small feature is the Arena Mode, where you can explore the combat system with pre-defined characters on several maps. All this features offer easy access to multiplayer, I have atm ver 250 hours into this already great game and multiplayer worked fine every time. I regard Divinity Original Sin 2 in the highest order. This game was highly enjoyable already in its year in Early Access although it missed some of its features. Full release is now only two weeks away and if you like calssic RPGs which give you a challenging gameplay, try this game out. If you are into turn - based combat and tactical RPGs, you will find a great time here.  Gameplay 10/10 UI 9/10 Sound 9/10 Graphics 10/10 Story 9/10"

You dont need to have played D:OS1 to enjoy this game. Players of D:OS1 will have some easter eggs. Lighthearted and dark at the same time.  Voiced narrator and characters (every RPG needs one, once you go voiced you cant go back to reading blocks of texts)  Con: Some bugs and performance issues. some sadness at the end (the kind that you get after finishing a really good book with no immediate sequels)  This is one of those games that by the time the credits roll, you want to give the devs a standing ovation.  P.S: if you want front row seats to the main story use Fane as your main character.  If you want an amazing/rich and personal story, pick Lohse. If you want a revenge/redemption tale, pick Ifan/Sebille/Beast If you want to experience a disgraced noble's rise to power pick The red prince.   "

I looked in a mirror and saw that I'd aged 60 years, my jowls sagged, leathery eyelids hung heavy over my now grey faded eyes. I looked outside and saw the changed world. The people wore such strange clothing, some wore suits of purple fur with their faces painted into crude animal caricatures, other people wore shoes on their hands and gloves on their feet, but nothing else.

There's such a large amount of things to find, places to explore, animals to talk to (If you have the required talent) and let‚Äôs not forget, towns filled with victims to pickpocket!   There are so many different classes you can have and you're not limited in any way, you could be a rogue necromancer or a tank archer if you wanted.   I'm 60+ hours in and it has not gotten tedious or started to feel formulaic or repetitive, which is something that I've never seen happen in a long single player game either.  The side stories, environments and things you do are varied enough to feel fresh after 60+ hours, the sense of exploration and adventure never goes away.   Every time you level up or progress further in the story you are rewarded with new spells and abilities that keep expanding on the combat and allowing you to experiment and try new builds and tactics, which keeps you from falling into familiar combat patterns/habits and keeps you entertained.

I played the first one with my girlfriend and the co-op experience of two Lone Wolves was amazing, the second part is the same but with more content, nothing more.  Pros:  - Split Screen for PC - Very good Graphics - Unique storytelling and situations. - Best combat in a RPG so far (Sorry for the RTWP lovers) - Pet Pal Talent - Wells - Very good customization of characters, the magic mirror is amazing. - Very well optimized, the game runs smooth with a GTX770 in ultra, only few freezes in split screen.  Cons:   - ORIGINS, I don't like premade characters, if you choose lone wolf you skip a very big part of the game. - No Linux support. Seriously Larian? I needed to make a partition only to play the game. - Poor localization. I'm a native spanish speaker (I'm from Spain), for me english is not an issue but it is for my girlfriend...

For instance just now; a fading mine that cloaks when your near.  -I saw it and manuver my man to a point where straight line in a safe corridor was the direct path. -I click the destination and my digidal dynamo heads off straight as an arrow like planned, only to vear 45* left straight into the mine blowing it and dodging a terrifying patch of THIN AIR!

They are continuing to update the game even now after full release to patch out some of the missed bugs which is reassuring.  Unlimited replayability, I've restarted at least 10-15 times now without finishing the game just because I figure something out, or I want to try something else.  Not because what I'm doing is getting stale, but rather that I'm just so curious about different outcomes that I'm compelled to go look at the alternative.   The multiplayer hop in/hop out style is super easy to learn, and I've already started working with the game master mode.  As a DnD GM, I can see the potential of divinity's game master mode, but I can tell it will take some learning and getting use to.  However I dont feel overwhelmed by any of the tutorials they have online, or any of the software.  Thanks for the awesome game."

Marirow,457,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,44.6," I'd recommend this game if you're a fan of tactical games like XCOM or Fire Emblem, or if you like story-heavy games.  The combat is the strongest part of the game, but it's also the hardest to get into; I had to restart the game multiple times to get the right party structure to tackle the game's challenges.  Adaptability and crowd control are key in this combat system. If you don't have the right party makeup, skills, and items, then it's going to feel like the game is cheating you. Enemies will constantly be inflicting status conditions (usually turn-skipping ones) if your armor isn't up to snuff. A lack of skills means that enemies will be able to out-maneuver and out-damage you. And, of course, having a party of all mages isn't a good idea when archers can just sit and take potshots at you three times a turn. If you're not sure what you're doing, there's no shame in playing on the lower difficulty setting. Trust me.  The other two major selling points of this game are the story and the exploration, both of which are a bit weaker in terms of originality but are just as great as the combat system. The dialogue is your standard Neverwinter Nights affair, made a bit spicier by the Tags system. Simply put, each character has Tags (related to aspects of their personality, history, or appearance) that give unique dialogue options. You can even acquire new tags as you play, making the system versatile as well. The dialogue itself is well-written and hilarious at times, giving the game a comedic twist and elevating it from a drab, boring fantasy adventure. I won't spoil the story, but I'll say that after 30 hours I've only brushed up against what the story has to offer. The thousands upon thousands of dialogue trees are backed up by some impressive voice acting, which makes reading through the game's story (which might as well be novel length, if not longer) actually fun and engaging instead of a slog.  The exploration, then. This is probably the weakest part of the game-- not  bad,  just  weaker.  The world is enormous and full of sidequests, characters, and miniature adventures to go on, which really scratched my explorative itch. However, I often felt that the game wasn't using its exploration elements as well as it could. Quests can only really reward you with money and gear; money always gets hoovered by buying new, better gear from shopkeepers, and gear almost always becomes obsolete as soon as your characters level up. I found myself picking up really cool, unique gear, only for it to be  immediately  replaced by something slightly better. This is on top of a loot system that leaves your inventory constantly cluttered with random garbage, and forces you to check every single empty crate just in case there's a scroll of resurrection inside. I swear, Rivellon has an epidemic of empty crates.  In short, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a  very good game.  My biggest complaints are with the little things. The combat is just a little to obtuse, the exploration is just a little too unimportant, etc. The good things far, far outweigh the bad. If you're a fan of CRPGs, like games that focus on the story, or enjoy tactical combat, this game is an excellent buy."

Ridiculous Primate,17,2,0,"October 30, 2017",Recommended,276.4,"This game is one of my favorites of all time now. The world is immersive and beautiful.  The battles are challenging yet rewarding.  I played through it on Tactician mode  out of the gate because I beat the first game on Tactician mode and figured I'd master this in no time too.  The difficulty was surprising at times.  But one thing that I really liked about the difficulty was that it didn't rely on RNG for everything.  There are a few RNG elements, but for the most part the fights are designed to be beaten by strategy and predicting what the enemies would do. The over arching story was pretty classic, but what made me really love it was the companion stories.  They were really interesting and I really loved them.  Some people on here have commented that the companions don't interact much, and while I would have loved for them to interact more than they did, I feel like their stories cross over a lot.  For example Sebille and the Red Prince's stories straight up merge near the end if you are playing with them both in the party. I would suggest taking Lohse in your party too, because her personal quest is one of the best. I know there are still some bugs, and those can be frustrating. I know it uses some classic tropes, but classic tropes are classic for a reason.  Sometimes when you try  to reinvent the wheel you end up making a block of rock. The game also does successfully reinvent the wheel at a few points. I played it all through tactician mode and felt it was a good difficulty considering I took the hardest option.  If you are playing a game on the hardest setting you should expect to have to fight some fights multiple times to master them, and it makes me so happy that I never felt like I was just flipping a coin to win a fight.  Every decision in fights matters a lot. It's not a perfect game, but no game has ever been perfect.  This game is pretty damn good though, and if they fixed the broken quests and bugs I would put it in my top 5 RPGs instantly.  My major complaint about this game is that there isn't more of it.  I can't wait for some DLC."
Atara Mos,174,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,147.3,"I had played the prior game and was encouraged to pick this game up in Beta because of the promise of having more than just one friend join you. In the Beta alone I have over 30 hours of play time, and we barely got out of the first area. That isn't a bad thing at all! That is a testament to the variety of ways that you can do things. We wanted to try all the different classes, the different racial traits, the different talents. The addition of a single talent can entirely change how the story plays out, which dramatically increases replayability. You're presented with multiple ways to resolve your quests, and each are different and can have influence on multiple aspects of your character. Despite the 30+ hours in beta I still found entirely new things in release.  The story is rich and deep because of how so much of your character influences different interactions and what you find along the way. The combat being turn based is a lot more thoughtful than just running up and bashing your strongest skill, you can truly use the environment to your advantage, or accidentally screw yourself over with it if you aren't careful.  It really harkens back to the classic rpgs of the past in such a great way.  My only real critique is that the learning curve is sort of steep to start, camera movement isn't the most intuitive and takes a bit to figure out the finessing of it, as the tutorial is minimal. This can lead to some funny interactions, though, as you figure out that maybe red outlined things aren't the best thing to click on with others around."
No Name Salted Butter,156,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,62.7,"Easily one of the best RPG's ever made.  To me it has a feel similar to the fable titles with the freedom you get (within reason) during a dungeon and dragons session.   The combat is tactical and challenging while also rewarding, the characters are interesting, the world is beautiful and fleshed out, and overall the game once it was fully released is polished and well worth the wait and money put into it.   The game master mode is also a welcomed addition, only adds to value of the game."
NumbTongue,262,2,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,28.4,Possibly the very first game to truly mimick most of the best aspects of pen and paper D&D with it's unique Game Master Mode. I honestly can't wait to get a group together and play this.
Mahebra,291,2,0,"September 13, 2017",Recommended,238.5,"Improves on the original in every way.  Original Sin 1 was probably one of the best CRPGs I had ever played to that date, and I could find little to no flaws with it, many of which were improved upon in the Enhanced Edition of the game.   Original Sin 2 somehow manages to take that mastercraft and make it even better, the new systems and mechanics implemented in such a way that I find it almost hard to return to the original. I have spent an absurd amount of time on the Early Access alone, and cannot believe the amount of variety and feasability to the different ways to approach each situation.   I was a bit taken back by the new changes to the armor system -- having physical and/or magical armor protects you (and your enemies) from those CC abilities, which made the first game a bit of a race to CC the enemies before they could do it to you. Original Sin 2 found a interesting way to handle that, and building your team and skillset to tackle this new problem has made the combat far more interesting and more satisfying, while not over complicating things. Instead of a party make-up being almost required, you're now a bit more free to experiment with your set up, and the changes to the skill system allows you to experiment more with being a hybrid build, instead of having to take a strict path in order to maximize gains.  This game seems far more friendly to newer players, while still keeping much of the spice and charm that I've come to expect and love from Larian, and this newest entry has done nothing but please and delight me."
loved london in 1666,46,2,1,"October 25, 2017",Recommended,86.6,"So honestly i pirated this game for the first time, just to see it, I tried lots and lots of these type of games strategies and so. I could never get into it, it just never catch me, I've heard a lot of good reviews of this game but still not enough to risk and buy game i never loved genre of. So I pirated it and just fell in love in the first second. I clicked on the skull and hearrd my character  react, almost on everything, almost every single one. It took like few minutes I explored very first room, than I deleted illegal version and bought it. First I want to say that difficulty system is quiet‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you have the first one, which is for completely noobs like me, but when I learnt some and wanted more competitive gameplay, the next difficulty was too hard, of course for people who had experience in genre. In other ways, the game is amazing, almost all quests you have TONS of possibilities to complete it, or to fail it, or to... avoid it? And when you understand it, in your very first hour, it wakes your curiousity, you start seeking every corner for gameplay pieces, dialogues, you start fast-saving to see all ways of conversations. I am wasting hours in this game, reading all books, my own journal, and still into it. The story is actually very obivious and classic for fantasy. If you read mass fantasy books, movies etc the story will be extremely predictable and boring, but that doesnt make game boring cause of reasons I mentioned above. By playing this game I learnt basics of this genre, and enjoyed already 20 with some hours and ready for much much more. Of course this game has big potention because of simple replayability, and mod support.  Overall I can rate this game on few fields: Story: 5/10 - It is REALLY typical, but still it has good telling Graphics: 7/10 - I know texture quality is not the first criteria rating strategy games, but still it is not very bad, but unlikely most cool texture quality games it looks really beautiful, bright and contrast perfectly balanced. It adds a big load of atmosphere. Gameplay: 10/10 - Basicly not because of this step-by-step, this gameplay actually never different a lot from other games in the genre, because of the variaty and the high quality in every single second in your gameplay, and you will see it, just as you jump in the game.  Buy it, really, you are wasting your time watching reviews or pirating just like i did."

The Ridiculous Rav,241,2,0,"September 25, 2017",Recommended,48.4,"I like it, but buyer beware it doesn't play like a ""modern"" RPG at all. It's really tough, but the non-combat gameplay is so encompassing that I can almost overlook it.  I'm playing on the 2nd easiest difficulty, and I've spent most of my time playing this game just trying to beat the first three fights. All the fights are so difficult that I have to save-scrub each of them multiple times; I can't imagine how hard playing this on the hardest difficulty is.  Super in-depth lore, lots of stuff to be engrossed inside. The world feels a lot like a less grim Path-of-Exile (you're sent to a prison island), which I like a lot.  I'm about to restart the game on the easiest difficulty. I'm not super into RTS or ""Strategy"" games, but I do like RPG's. I'd recommend people who haven't played Divinity Original Sin 1 to do the same, and if you think the game is too easy after the first few fights just amp up the difficulty."

StolenMadWolf,91,2,0,"September 10, 2017",Recommended,93.6,"Okay, this review is way overdue, but I wanted to take all the time I need to fully explore this game before getting it up. This proved more difficult than I hoped for a few different reasons and I‚Äôve decided just to take what I have got and get this review up now. Because this game deserves the praise. I did a review for the beta, and to be honest, not much can be changed from that previous one. But I will try and do a change up and update.  In DOS 2, you play as a Sourcer, an individual able to use a powerful magic known as Source. Unfortunately for you at the time of the game, said magic has some negative issues and you are persecuted and rounded up for 'curing'. Naturally, there is more to you then meets the eye, and your certainly not planning on sticking around for the 'cure'. This evolves into a deep and complex plot as you go on a quest not only to save the world, but to become the next divine, a form of demi-god. Only thing is, only one of four characters can be that.  Starting off with gameplay, first off, you have excellent roleplaying potential. You can select one of a few origin stories or create your own custom character, with their own origins, starting abilities and ‚Äòtags‚Äô, which offer additional dialogue options and opens up several possibilities in interactions. There are no classes in the game (the 'classes' you pick at the start of the game only really define your starting abilities, stats and maybe appearance.) which coupled with the simple, but very nicely done customisation system and wide range and freedom of dialogue lets you create the character you want to roleplay as in game. This is especially true with the ability to play the game you want to play it. Be a noble knight? Check. Be an anti-heroic rogue? Check. Kill every sucker in sight for the lols? Well, not everyone so you don't break the game, but check. Which leads me onto the combat. I love it. It's the good old fashioned slow-paced turn based gameplay that is so rarely used nowadays outside of some specific games. You can use basic attacks, abilities, consumables and magic to fight your way through your encounters, or, with a bit of luck, avoid them. You can utilise your abilities and the environment to create powerful combinations for attack and defence and there is a great deal of strategy and tactics to be had, encouraging you to think before you act. When you win a tough battle, you feel a sense of relief and of course, the feeling of being a badass.  Also, unlike many RPGs, especially amongst the older ones and the MMO's, the game is complex enough to make you think and to make you invest time into the game, but simple enough not to confuse you or tire you out and hence allow you to stay immersed. Few games can get that balance right.  Couple the roleplaying and combat together along with companions with different relationship values, and boom, you have the ideal combat roleplaying game ready to go. Even better though is the fact that whilst you can play the game solo, on your own or with a playable NPC party. You can also bring in three other players in on your campaign adventure with their own characters. The possibilities of cooperation, backstabbing, competition, friendship and the occasional bit of griefing or trolling with four human players is endless. All in all, by pure basic gameplay along, it‚Äôs utterly fantastic solo or with a group of friends.  There is a catch to this though‚Ä¶ this game can be insanely hard, at least initially. The enemy plays smart and can wipe the floor with you if you‚Äôre not careful. Once you start getting reasonable equipment, abilities and spells you start to find yourself increasingly able to slaughter your way through most of your opponents‚Ä¶ until you hit the bigger fights and the bosses, in which case, you promptly start getting your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•kicked, even on the lowest difficulty so be ready to save scum and rerun fights. Unfortunately, some quests and fights can feel just unfair at times regardless of where you are at, so be careful.  The campaign for DOS 2 is deep, complex and gripping, always encouraging you to continue playing through to the end. It has excellent characters and voice acting, coupled in with an unpredictable and well-done story with multiple endings with variations. It certain stands out as a solid campaign with numerous sub quests and side stories alongside the main one, couple this in with a natural inclination to explore the map, and you soon find yourself more than happily working to complete whatever you can find. The story‚Äôs one real weakness is that it suffers Halo 4 syndrome. Anyone familiar with the series will quickly get the gist of the plot, events and characters, whilst newcomers will be left scratching their heads as they try and get a better understanding of setting. Thankfully, a lot of this is covered as you progress through the game and you will soon get an understanding of the story and setting, which is solid enough to stand on its own two feet. The campaign is strong throughout Acts 1-3 but weakens in Act 4 due to some almost unfair and annoying quests, situations and fights, but the very final segment makes up for it.  I was able to complete the campaign on the easiest difficulty in about 40 hours, probably a little bit longer. You could do it quicker, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it if you want to have an easier time with fighting opponents. However, with multiple companions, replayability is definitely a thing with the game. I recommend playing the game at least three times. Once with your own character and three origin companions, once with the origin characters you didn‚Äôt pick and an previously used origin character of your choice and a third playthrough in Coop, so you get your money‚Äôs worth in the campaign by time alone.  Now, it‚Äôs not just the campaign. The developers went a step further and adding in a competitive multiplayer versus mode called arena, where you and other players fight each other alongside a custom campaign mode called Gamemaster, where you can play campaigns made by yourself or other players. Unfortunately, at the time of this review, games with random people are almost impossible in these modes and likely the campaign too. Every match is either full, empty or has one guy AFK, so in the end, I was only able to get one arena match in. It feels much like the regular campaign, but it‚Äôs a nice thought and addition. I wasn‚Äôt even able to go and play with Gamemaster at all. So you are going to need to organise with friends to full try that out. However, they are worthy additions which will add a few more hours to the game.  In addition, the art design, sound effects and the music deserve A*-grade damn rewards. This game is staggeringly beautiful to behold with excellent music through the different stages to immerse you into the world.  As a bonus, the game seems free of bugs and runs well on decent computers, even very low spec PCs and laptops have been able to run it, but be careful with the lower spec PCs. I did notice that as I progressed through the campaign, I did start getting performance drops, lag and even near crashes by the time I reached the last few hours of the game, luckily though, I suffered no crashes, though I came close on occasion. Just be warned.  All in all, Divinity Original Sin 2 is an utterly fantastic game that is worth every penny, even if you just play the campaign, you will get your money‚Äôs worth and it gets better with friends. If you are a fan of roleplay and strategy, and are willing to put up with the extremely difficult encounters, this game deserves a place in your library. The challenge and weaker Act 4 stops me from giving the game 10/10, but it still earns 9/10 and my own Wolfy seal of approval. I implore you to get this game. Trust me, you won‚Äôt regret it."

Rhythm Rug,114,2,0,February 7,Recommended,94.6,"I don't usually write reviews for games but this one deserves one. From the get go this game is absolutley stunning from graphics to gameplay and everything in between. The music captures each moment and truly adds to atmosphere of the game. The leveling is great and makes you feel like you earned each skill and source point. The map is huge and just keeps on giving. The story is fantastic and immersive, it takes you in to the world and makes you feel apart of it. The ending of the game truly makes you feel like what you accomplished throughout the game actually mattered, each quest and storyline had a purpose. The little easter eggs hidden in the game makes you feel like the developers are in touch with the playerbase and just add enjoyment to the game.   The great thing about this is the game does not stop there, with the DM mode at your fingertips you can grab your friends and make your own story. The workshop content is great and I can't wait to try out all the mods and different stories that are coming out. The game just keeps on giving. The reason I even wrote this review is because the developers deserve every bit of credit and praise they are given, this is what gaming is supposed to look like and more developers need to take note. If you are on my friends list and reading this and are still on the edge, message me and I will continue to rant about how good this game is. To everyone else, if you enjoy these types of RPGs, its a no brainer. To those who don't know if they will enjoy this genre or type of game, I was also in this boat, but damn if it wasn't a good pick up."

exoroyal,247,2,0,February 24,Recommended,86.7,"After I played The Witcher 3 the way I see RPG and Action RPG games changed. Now I want more and most games don't give me what i want. Games that I used to love are just meh to me now.  After playing Divinity Original Sin and Divinity Original Sin 2 (I played them back to back) I must say the way I view RPG's changed again... This is one of the best games a ever played. The story is great, the gameplay is fantastic. Really solid game.  The only thing that makes me sad is that I think the lore of the games seems to be a little inconsistent and I can't find about it much on the web. For example the name Braccus Rex is dropped left and right during these games but all I know is that he is a king that lived thousands of years ago and he was bad.

Noobsauce,83,2,0,February 18,Recommended,335.0,"Pros:  Amazing roleplaying/DnD feel. Interesting characters, witty writing, and I haven't played a game that left you this many choices since Fallout New Vegas (almost anyone can be killed at any time). Highly recommend playing one of the ""Origin"" players, or if not, at least having them as your party members, a lot of the great story telling revolves around them.  Combat system is fun and allows for a lot of theory crafting/playstyles, to the point where even people who dont' care about the RP aspect of it at all still enjoy this game. Few gripes with certain aspets but overall it feels interesting/diverse. Fights are HARD, even on normal difficulty, but far from unbeatable.   This game handles multiplayer in what is essentially a single player world better than any other game I've ever seen. The game is coded like an MMO, so you and your friends can travel hafl way across the world in a random pub and your friend can still play their game. Seemlessly allows you to hop in and out of someone's game too.  Cons:  Some weird quirks with combat that could be improved (fighting with characters while others are in dialogue, main attributes feeling uninterseting), but really this is just a tiny complaint.  In the mid part of the game it's easy to lose focus, it's so open world that you can get bogged with side quests and forget what you were supposed to be doing in the first place.  Crafting system/Inventory system feels a little meh. Crafting can honestly be 100% ignored so this  doesn't detract from the game too much, but organizing /sorting through your inventory can feel tedious at times."

Antoinette,131,2,0,April 13,Recommended,215.2,"First time writing a review and wow does this game absolutely deserve it.  If you're a fan of cRPG's in any sense (think Baulder's Gate) you will absolutely love this.   The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, the graphics are great, the gameplay is where it REALLY shines. The fights are difficult, the AI is actually smart, and tactician will put your characters through a grinder when you thought you had it down.  At no point in the game did I feel like it was a slog or a chore to get through during my first playthrough, there was always something meaningful I could do. Just one more side quest before the main story, helping out this one person, talking to this one chicken. The story is also very well done, I feel as though I could actually talk to the characters if they were real people, they are fleshed out very well.   Larian is an extremely awesome company, they delayed the release of the game to add in a fully voiced game due to community request. They listen to their customers, apply the feedback properly, and keep them updated. Definitely the best game company out there right now.  The first act is a very good tutorial, the second act builds the world and the story, and act 3 and 4 take the fun of those two and multiply it by 5. I don't have enough good things to say about this game. The only negative is that it has now ruined so many others for me, because they won't be as good as this. Now I'm bored and don't know what else to start playing.   Ratings: Music: 15/10 (seriously the soundtrack is THAT good) Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Difficulty: 10/10 (has difficulties for all levels of players)  Overall it is a top 3 game that I have ever played.

It's really that great if you into RPG stuff. If you not it's the best place to start. If you have friends who would like to play it with you, it will be your GOTY, for sure.  Pros: Great graphics. One of the best fantasy soundtracks in gaming history. Great campaign with funny, intense moments, scary and entertaining moments. Great writing and overall plot. Huge replayability. Awesome tactical combats. Complex and flexible character building. The best implementation of the coop gameplay in all RPGs ever. Game Master mode for those who would like to play with their friends even after the campaign. A great mod tool that allows you do almost anything in the game. If you willing to spend some time off cause. Content in the game for 100+ hours minimum. Arena PVP mode exists.  Cons: The game still has some bugs. Though all great RPGs has and developers are working really hard fixing them. GM mode could have more love. It lacks a lot of crucial features and a lot of things that exist in the game are unavailable. Though mods in the workshop can help with fixing some of them. Arena PVP mode could have even more love. It's very primitive and it seems like developers haven't worked much on it. Hope they will improve it in the future.  Should you buy it? Definitely!"

Eilik,609,2,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,132.4,"I'm just writing a very brief review, in no way am I actually giving this game justice with my words, but I feel I have to write something as this game has consumed my life for the past 4 or 5 days.  Let's get started with the fact that I have not played any of the previous Divinity games, however I am a huge fan of CRPGs, stemming from the time I originally sat down and played the Dungeons and Dragons dungeon crawler: Pool of Raidiance - Ruins of Myth Drannor. Since that time I had backtracked, played through Neverwinter 1 and 2, though never actually completing them, as well as Wasteland, the Fallout series, pretty much most of the 'mainstream' crpgs most people are familiar with.  A few days ago a friend tossed me this game as a gift, honestly I am very thankful as this game has breathed new life into my fascination to this genre.  From the get go, the game is not forgiving, if you ignore obvious signs, you will die. Even on the normal difficulties if you lack in perception, the game has no qualm about stamping your expectations in the dust. And even if you are paying attention, it still does so. The way it handles ground effects, along with most spells being aoe, and actually having an impact. So you better think twice about casting that poison spell with your undead mage because he may be low health, but you may end up be using 3 resurrection scrolls instead of just one. Or you may send the dominoes of chaos smashing together to kill literally everything on the battlefield, as well as yourself.  Difficulty doesn't spike horribly though, once you get the hang of things, it's actually a breeze if you're used to any kind of tactics, especially in classic mode. Though I give credit to the enemy AI. There are times they are smarter than their own good, geeking the mage rather than going after my tanky knight front and center.  However this is a downside as well, because if my undead is under an enchantment to appear for all intensive purposes, as an elf. How yould you know it was undead to cast that heal spell on it?  But I digress, I have 60 hours in the game, I had finally after a lot of exploration started exploring the place after the initial island, and I am loving the game even more. Again, this isn't even half of my feelings, there are obviously some negatives, but they have already been stated by someone else, or I feel they are not an issue.  I heartily reccomend, I got it as a gift, and I actually wish I had been able to buy it myself."

Draenei For Life (Josh),239,2,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,105.4,"GAME OF THE YEAR FOR ME. ALSO if you play this game keep the black cat alive, trust me its so worth it.   SO the good things about this game: The story/writing has vastly been improved saince the first game, I loved the first one but the story never really pulled me in, this one however pulls me in within the first hour. The combat is still as fun and tactical as the first, with far more combinations of spells and abilities (plus waaayyy more spells, classes and abilities in general). The character creation is fun, its not too long and crazy but allows you to make (or customize an existing character) to be the character you wanna play. The companions are all detailed with decent stories and they all have different impacts on the storyline and each other. Gamemaster Mode is incredible fun, it feels like the D&D campaign creator I've always wanted. This game has up to 4 player multiplayer for the full game, so if you have the friends jump into this with them.   Few neutral things: The music is kind of average, a few fun tunes but feels generic. The crafting system is no longer a cluster of confusing rubbish, so its not a negative, it still doesn't feel very important though, on my solo playthrough and playthrough with friend we both ignore it as it feels still not that useful. Arena mode is a rare giggle but feels kind of incomplete. While its very true many quests allow you to do them  in different ways which is fab, some of them matter little, you will be given like 5 options (if you find them all) to finish a certain part however, you can just run back and do the other options for extra xp for killing them (as I do) making the choice slightly pointless.  Bad things for me (or things I think others will hate): The amount of races is fun (including undead versions), however, it feels like every race is here in vast quantities, no race feels rarer. If you do not like turn based combat this game is NOT FOR YOU AT ALL. Your characters pathing when you tell them to go someone in a fight will still decide to  casually run through fire/poison etc, or sometimes attacks of opportunity make ZERO sense. Gamemaster Mode has no way of making character talk, its all up to the GM. Now this last comment is something that just personally annoys me, but when you need to  help a character in a fight (or save them) they have this tendency to just go full in and take huge quantities of damage, they seem to have dumb AI compared to actual enemies.  I hope my review gave some insight on whether to purchase this game."

To keep it simple, here's what the original game done so well that was fantastic  - Fantastic Turn-Based Tactical Combat - Compelling Narrative  - No Handholding Approach to World Design - Challenging Encounters  - Beautiful Hand-Crafted World  The sequel improves on the above in pretty much every way but tweaks the formula  - 4 races to pick between and a 5th to come soon - Smarter AI, you can no longer butcher and steal while NPC's lick windows - Better pacing - Combat feels better all round, movement is punished less, animations feel tighter and the armour mechanic means you get CC cheesed a lot less  All round despite being an Alpha it's incredibly playable and I've noticed only minor bugs.

Harivdee,26,2,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,220.8,What can I say about this game. If you like this genre then its a no brainer.  If you dont like this genre or the lore/style I would ask to reconsider.  Try Path of Exile which is free and if you're have the least amount of fun on that game that means you will have 1000x fun in this one.  So many game modes and possibilities this game shows great promise and at a tremendous quality.  10/10.

The combat is phenomenal - would love to see a whole plethora of games with similar mechanics, if they could be similarly deep and balanced.  Similar but better than the turn-based gridded games I know - Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy tactics, Advance Wars. These were rough, alpha attempts that were not inspired enough to thresh out the real strategic possiblilities of turn-based gaming, to great depth.   Also just feels good - taking control of and building your characters in this game is particularly rewarding. You know and love them, and become intimately familiar with their capabilities even as throughout they grow in fits and spurts into more powerful, novel, and complicatedly effective beings.

LEVEL 5 DWARF,230,2,0,September 14,Recommended,90.3,"Overall recommended, but its widely known the last 25% of the game is generally disliked or at least not liked as well as the rest.  The first two acts are amazing, then the next two seem like they needed to ship product. I'd complain if i hadn't spent (guessing) 40 hours on the first two acts which are totally worth the money.  Yes the ending is terrible (I literally got an ending scene that i did not pick, yes several plot lines were not finished, yes there are more secret levers in act 4 than believable, yes the last fight is one which it's a totally valid not doing it and just watching the youtube.  That said, i recommend.  I assume the new version of the game has fixed these issues or at least the big ones, but as the old saves were incompatible and i was just into act 3, i didn't restart to find out."

Epicjynx,155,2,0,February 12,Recommended,65.0,"Great game, a true RPG and the closest thing to a Dungeons and Dragons video game. There is so much to do in this game, every location has secrets, every NPC can be interacted with (and is voice acted, spectacularly I might add) even animals can be talked to with a certain ability, every quest is written masterfully, and the combat is what all turn based games should strive to be.  I only have 2 complaints, the first is about performance. This game stutters a lot while not being the most graphically impressing and takes up a lot of RAM use. Load times are fairly long and sometimes the sound cuts out for up to 30 seconds.  The second is about multiplayer. It's unplayable for me, after a while it's impossible to connect to an old save, the only way to play is start a new save everytime.  Other than that the game is fantastic, just wish they fixed these issues."
The_Burbs,299,2,0,"October 15, 2017",Recommended,113.5,Any tabletop RPG or just RPG fans in general need to play this game. It is a masterclass of the genre. It works well as a solo game but really shines when you play with friends

The music help set's the scene and fits in beautifully with the game. The AI is rather smart and can be quite difficult to overcome in some battles but persistence is a key.

Snardbuckett,227,2,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,626.6,"At first i was quite apprehensive, i played the game at a friends house in beta and i did not like the direction the game was going at first. The original armor system was akin to mass effect 2 and it felt very rock paper scissors like .... Thanksfully shy of release they made a drastic change in how armor works and he new system is quite refreshing and i like it.  the addition of a band of characters who are not blank slates while still being customizable for how you mechnically want to play the game was freaking brilliant. I love specifically Fane and Lfan the most but all of the characters are this fantastic dichotomy of being terrible people yet relatable people that seem like thier actions are primarily tainted by being on the wrong side of a ""very bad day"".  i think they did  aslightly better job of making it somewhat apparent where and what you needed to do from the get go and the ""tutorial"" section on the ship is great, playing throught the turtorial is drastically better than a pile of exposition to tell you how to play an RPG from the ground up.  Im not 100% sold on the new skill system as better, but it certainly is fluid and doent punish you as harshly for side speccing, i also like that crafting does not require skill investment and that the ""Civil"" skills have been split off so you dont have to try to choose between skewering harder or not sounding like a neanderthal in conversation.  I do however wish crafting seemed more impactful at low levels .... custom crafting your weapons and getting ahead of the curve through exploration theft and smart trading was quite fun in OS1. i find that somewhat removed in OS2 and most crafting early game is primarily for ""consumables"" and the customization of old on your own crafted weapons seems somewhat limited (using essences to add a damage type)  the introduction of more playable character races is a welcome change and the tag system really amps up the replayability to 11. I definitely agree with the sentiment its one of the best game sof the year quite possibly the best yet."

The Cons:  .There are a few bugs (turns taking a while to end) but nothing major .It was released without some languages installed last minute, boo hoo most people work so couldnt even play it on release anyway .Look at the negative reviews, 95% of them are ridiculious  Pros: .Everything! The freedom, the charachter creation, the gameplay and the massively in-depth story. .Dont like somebody? be it good or bad, no problem you can just kill them!  If you like turn-based or classic RPG's this is the new King of the Genre.  Larian are the best most honest development studio ever (i kickstartered both their Original sin titles) if they make a mistake they let you know and keep you updated.  10/10 i will buy any larian game in a hearbeat. <------take note ubisoft/EA this is how you make a good game."

Old Man Pizza Tony,124,2,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,127.4,"I have been playing this game since EA last year. Not religiously, mind you. But loading it up after just about every patch and playing Act 1 with my buddy. It has changed a lot since last December, and all of it for the better. I will mostly try to cover the changes since Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition, which I played through several times with a friend on Xbox One. I have not beat this game yet, and I probably won't for another 100+ hours. I am running multiple concurrent playthroughs with several friends and that takes an inordinate amount of time with how I play.  The tone of this game is not vastly different than the orignal, but it is different enough. No more vendors are yelling at you about cheese or entussling scrolls. The supporting cast is overall less goofy. You don't run into an obnoxious Goblin in the player housing and the new supporting cast is about 20x more interesting, despite the slightly more serious tone. The voice acting is stellar and a major surprise that it even happened at all, considering the vast amount of dialogue. Every character feels distinct and makes me want to talk to them. There are plenty of funny little dialogue throwbacks to weird little things that happened in the first game. From a talking skull in the very first area, a Dragon Commander character in Act 1, being scolded for looking for needles in haystacks, to references to Arhu in a random book 99% of players will never read. The narrator's voice is on point with inflection and appropriate humour for every dialogue option so far. I seriously cannot state how amazing the voice actors are in this game. There are just as many jokes and funny choices in this game as the first, neat sidequests, and funny names abound. They are just more in line with the slightly more serious tone of this game. The companions don't have absurd names like Bairdotr, but they are still colorful and interesting. They have their own goals and interact with the game world in very different ways.   Combat is infintely improved. High ground is decisive in victory, range combat is king, and making pure physical/magic builds is necessary for CC'ing high level enemies. No more RNG exists for crowd controlling enemies. It is based on depletable magical and physical armor. The armor values do not regenerate without special skills, but if you are making a solid build, there are ways to replenish this. The AI is smarter and know to avoid retribution builds, to target high DPS weak characters, and path around ground hazards. They pull neat tricks that only a player would have done in DoS:1. They set up combos turns in advance and enemy parties have really good synergy. Despite all this, the combat feels fair. They work within the confines of the game and the skills are very well explained. If you find your build is lackluster, that is fine, respeccing is free and readily available in Act 2. The build diversity is insane. Splashing for utility is extremely viable and necessary. Pure builds work in almost all encounters. I love the fact that everything but Rogue is usable. Memory is a huge cahnge, you can learn every single skill that your stats allow, but cannot put them on your bar unless you have enough memory slots to learn the skills. This does restrict how many spells you can use at once, but it is also balanced and the whole game is built around it. this is not a bad change, but it is a major one.  The biggest and best change is the removal of crafting as a skill. Anyone can utilize materials found without having to waste valuable points. Stealing art is still a valuable way to make money. I don't know how anyone could even play this game without a dedicated thief character. The game is not Skyrim, you simply cannot do everything in one playthrough. So many choices will fully lock you out of dialogue trees or quests. Not in a restrictive way, but in a lore-friendsly and realistic way.   If you want an RPG that has stellar combat, engaging dialogue, and love lots of reading, this game is for you. This game is not for everyone, and just because it wasn't made for you, does not mean this game is not a masterpiece."
Boonidle,117,2,0,"October 1, 2017",Recommended,80.6,"Absolutely fantastic game! Feels very old school yet modern and requires you to actually think about the actions you perform every step of the way. So much to do and see it's insane, not to mention voice acting almost every line in the game. This is one of the best RPGs I've played and it deserves the praise."
NightSn1PeR,245,2,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,178.2,"Best thing wich happend with CRPG genre for last years so far. Game contains ideal mix of oldschool and new-gen design decisions wich makes game pleasurable to play for both generations. Soo much content wich always have few ways to be done. Some quests require brain activity but doesnt overcomplicate with them. Exploring part is rewarding your eagle eye. Origin characters which written really well and can affect main story. Music was enjoyable even for me and i'm not a fan of fantasy themes. Even if game has some weak or bad moments they will never overcome all good stuff in that piece of art. And i think its first time in my life when game deserves max possible grade.    ""Masterpiece of genre in game industry"" "

Scooty,51,2,0,September 5,Recommended,56.6,"Not a title for 100%ers or the very tactical.  This is fun on it's own AND there is a Dungeon Master mode I havnt used yet. Downside is sort of strange fiction where clerics heal by sucking blood off the ground? Very detailed but still odd to me. Fun game.  I'm having an issue where I get jumped by badguys near the edge of town. I run into town and stand next to a town guard.  I stay in combat because exiting teleports you like fast travel. He is still out there watching me get beaten down in front of him while never ever attacking the guy burning EVERYTHING. (the fire does nothing to the guards and townsfolk not in combat yet hugging)  So there is that. Still a good game.  This is quickly turning into a feces title.  In sneak as a barrel tucked in a corner behind a tent BUT the guard detect vision goes through that type of object.   So much saving and loading because of lack of polish.  For instance just now; a fading mine that cloaks when your near.  -I saw it and manuver my man to a point where straight line in a safe corridor was the direct path. -I click the destination and my digidal dynamo heads off straight as an arrow like planned, only to vear 45* left straight into the mine blowing it and dodging a terrifying patch of THIN AIR!

We killed one of the bosses by turning all of the blood in a room into poison and then teleporting a candle into the poison, blowing up all of the enemies.

Some quests mean you gotta talk to someone, someone else may want that person dead. Sometimes you even gotta fight your friends in a fun arena-style system. Combat is amazing, especially when you have the turn-based gameplay to help stage brutal combos to dispatch multiple enemies. From exploiting elements, to staging ambushes for the enemy you just turned into a chicken, the options are vast. Story so far is pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing good. As I stated initially, everyone has their own upbringings and goals that sometimes conflict or align at various parts of the plot. While the beginning of the game seems very linear (""We gotta get out of this place!"") The variety of methods and questlines to accomplish that is guaranteed to bring in a second playthrough. I recommend this game to people who enjoy co-op gameplay, intricate stories, or just solid fantasy RPGs; this game has been a hit on all fronts for me and it feels good to play a sequel that just comes out better than the previous game.

Divinity: Original Sin 2 is on a level of quality and brilliance that only very few game studios have achieved so far. My respect to the belgian developers of Larian Studios, who are an amazing example of a studio crowdfunding games to deliver the best experience they possibly could.

Psytric,191,2,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,44.2,"An absolutely stellar game.  One of the best cRPGs in years, with, in my opinion, the best combat system ever.  Pros: - Excellent writing - Great voice-acting - Absolutely spectactular combat  - Huge variation in character development - Multiple ways to accomplish just about any task - Tons of hidden gems secreted away throughout your journeys - A number of innovative systems, like the Physical/Magical armor system, companions whose class you can choose when they join your party, and many others - Great coop experience - Well executed battlefield construction - high ground, cover are very important concepts to utilize in combat with serious bonuses - Fantastic AI - Enemies and friends alike don't blunder through dangerous terrain, enemies use battlefield to great effect.  They will be your primary teachers as you learn how to fight. - Very pretty  Cons: - Huge character variability inevitably leads to steep learning curves for some encounters - Similarly variety will make you want to reroll and start over several times until you're happy with a party - AoE and surface generation can make it difficult to use classic magic user strategy. Friendly AoE generally owns party members as much as enemies - Some matchups can be brutal depending on your composition - Is your party mostly magic/poison damage?  Better hope you don't face undead...  Have mostly melee champs?  Those archers are going to ruin you... - Still a number of bugs, though mostly not gamebreaking and fixes are actively being worked on by Larian Studios  All in all,  you can't go wrong with this one.  Just an absolutely wonderful game, a real ""holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•it's 4am"" experience that will infiltrate your dreams and daydreams."

StolenMadWolf,91,2,0,"September 10, 2017",Recommended,93.6,"Okay, this review is way overdue, but I wanted to take all the time I need to fully explore this game before getting it up. This proved more difficult than I hoped for a few different reasons and I‚Äôve decided just to take what I have got and get this review up now. Because this game deserves the praise. I did a review for the beta, and to be honest, not much can be changed from that previous one. But I will try and do a change up and update.  In DOS 2, you play as a Sourcer, an individual able to use a powerful magic known as Source. Unfortunately for you at the time of the game, said magic has some negative issues and you are persecuted and rounded up for 'curing'. Naturally, there is more to you then meets the eye, and your certainly not planning on sticking around for the 'cure'. This evolves into a deep and complex plot as you go on a quest not only to save the world, but to become the next divine, a form of demi-god. Only thing is, only one of four characters can be that.  Starting off with gameplay, first off, you have excellent roleplaying potential. You can select one of a few origin stories or create your own custom character, with their own origins, starting abilities and ‚Äòtags‚Äô, which offer additional dialogue options and opens up several possibilities in interactions. There are no classes in the game (the 'classes' you pick at the start of the game only really define your starting abilities, stats and maybe appearance.) which coupled with the simple, but very nicely done customisation system and wide range and freedom of dialogue lets you create the character you want to roleplay as in game. This is especially true with the ability to play the game you want to play it. Be a noble knight? Check. Be an anti-heroic rogue? Check. Kill every sucker in sight for the lols? Well, not everyone so you don't break the game, but check. Which leads me onto the combat. I love it. It's the good old fashioned slow-paced turn based gameplay that is so rarely used nowadays outside of some specific games. You can use basic attacks, abilities, consumables and magic to fight your way through your encounters, or, with a bit of luck, avoid them. You can utilise your abilities and the environment to create powerful combinations for attack and defence and there is a great deal of strategy and tactics to be had, encouraging you to think before you act. When you win a tough battle, you feel a sense of relief and of course, the feeling of being a badass.  Also, unlike many RPGs, especially amongst the older ones and the MMO's, the game is complex enough to make you think and to make you invest time into the game, but simple enough not to confuse you or tire you out and hence allow you to stay immersed. Few games can get that balance right.  Couple the roleplaying and combat together along with companions with different relationship values, and boom, you have the ideal combat roleplaying game ready to go. Even better though is the fact that whilst you can play the game solo, on your own or with a playable NPC party. You can also bring in three other players in on your campaign adventure with their own characters. The possibilities of cooperation, backstabbing, competition, friendship and the occasional bit of griefing or trolling with four human players is endless. All in all, by pure basic gameplay along, it‚Äôs utterly fantastic solo or with a group of friends.  There is a catch to this though‚Ä¶ this game can be insanely hard, at least initially. The enemy plays smart and can wipe the floor with you if you‚Äôre not careful. Once you start getting reasonable equipment, abilities and spells you start to find yourself increasingly able to slaughter your way through most of your opponents‚Ä¶ until you hit the bigger fights and the bosses, in which case, you promptly start getting your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•kicked, even on the lowest difficulty so be ready to save scum and rerun fights. Unfortunately, some quests and fights can feel just unfair at times regardless of where you are at, so be careful.  The campaign for DOS 2 is deep, complex and gripping, always encouraging you to continue playing through to the end. It has excellent characters and voice acting, coupled in with an unpredictable and well-done story with multiple endings with variations. It certain stands out as a solid campaign with numerous sub quests and side stories alongside the main one, couple this in with a natural inclination to explore the map, and you soon find yourself more than happily working to complete whatever you can find. The story‚Äôs one real weakness is that it suffers Halo 4 syndrome. Anyone familiar with the series will quickly get the gist of the plot, events and characters, whilst newcomers will be left scratching their heads as they try and get a better understanding of setting. Thankfully, a lot of this is covered as you progress through the game and you will soon get an understanding of the story and setting, which is solid enough to stand on its own two feet. The campaign is strong throughout Acts 1-3 but weakens in Act 4 due to some almost unfair and annoying quests, situations and fights, but the very final segment makes up for it.  I was able to complete the campaign on the easiest difficulty in about 40 hours, probably a little bit longer. You could do it quicker, but I wouldn‚Äôt recommend it if you want to have an easier time with fighting opponents. However, with multiple companions, replayability is definitely a thing with the game. I recommend playing the game at least three times. Once with your own character and three origin companions, once with the origin characters you didn‚Äôt pick and an previously used origin character of your choice and a third playthrough in Coop, so you get your money‚Äôs worth in the campaign by time alone.  Now, it‚Äôs not just the campaign. The developers went a step further and adding in a competitive multiplayer versus mode called arena, where you and other players fight each other alongside a custom campaign mode called Gamemaster, where you can play campaigns made by yourself or other players. Unfortunately, at the time of this review, games with random people are almost impossible in these modes and likely the campaign too. Every match is either full, empty or has one guy AFK, so in the end, I was only able to get one arena match in. It feels much like the regular campaign, but it‚Äôs a nice thought and addition. I wasn‚Äôt even able to go and play with Gamemaster at all. So you are going to need to organise with friends to full try that out. However, they are worthy additions which will add a few more hours to the game.  In addition, the art design, sound effects and the music deserve A*-grade damn rewards. This game is staggeringly beautiful to behold with excellent music through the different stages to immerse you into the world.  As a bonus, the game seems free of bugs and runs well on decent computers, even very low spec PCs and laptops have been able to run it, but be careful with the lower spec PCs. I did notice that as I progressed through the campaign, I did start getting performance drops, lag and even near crashes by the time I reached the last few hours of the game, luckily though, I suffered no crashes, though I came close on occasion. Just be warned.  All in all, Divinity Original Sin 2 is an utterly fantastic game that is worth every penny, even if you just play the campaign, you will get your money‚Äôs worth and it gets better with friends. If you are a fan of roleplay and strategy, and are willing to put up with the extremely difficult encounters, this game deserves a place in your library. The challenge and weaker Act 4 stops me from giving the game 10/10, but it still earns 9/10 and my own Wolfy seal of approval. I implore you to get this game. Trust me, you won‚Äôt regret it."

wally,143,2,0,January 17,Recommended,147.0,"This game is a veritable masterpiece, and I would wager the best game I have ever played. The sheer freedom you are offered and the extreme creative solutions you can use to figure out any and every puzzle, battle or even little distractions, is alone enough to make this purchase well worth it. But Larian Studios went above and beyond fully voice acting all 75k lines of dialogue. The game offers a unique take on combat, heavily focusing on the environment around you and how to use it to your advantage in combat, constantly fighting for highground, throwing barrels, or laying down sheets of slippery ice in order to barely claw through the fight. The combat offers insane depth and even offers an arena mode in which you can duel other players with custom parties. The story experience also offers a full drop in/drop out 4-player experience. Every player is free to do what they want and at times this can lead to conflicting goals and fighting between what the party will do.   Even with all of this to offer, Larian went even further and added a GM mode, which allows users to create custom campaigns and a game master to guide the groups adventure. This also comes with full steam workshop support, allowing you to mod the game as you wish.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is, I think, the best game ever created and I suggest that you purchase this work of art as soon as you are able."

The combat really stands head-and-shoulders above other classic RPGs like Tyranny and Pillars of Eternity. So few RPGs of any type really manage to make it feel like what skill or spell you're using really matters. In D:OS2 even weak skills and spells can find their place in combat if they can create an advantage. Even the weakest fire spell can turn the tides if the enemy is standing in oil.  Let me share some fun moments with the AI.  I thought I could bamboozle the enemy by giving my main character the Zombie trait. This trait allows them to heal when poisoned but take damage from healing spells/skills/potions. I foolishly assumed that they wouldn't be able to take advantage of that but if anything it made my life harder. So many AI enemies have a basic ranged healing spell/skill, some of which will restore health over several turns. They were all too happy to use them on my character.  At some other point, I was flirting with a woman who was part of a band of thugs. We got along well and promised to meet up in the future. Shortly after that I‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•off her boss by insisting that he free my elven kin. In the ensuing battle the woman I had wooed fought against her compatriots in order to help me. She burned alive in the fray and I vowed to take her diary with me for the rest of my days.  In another encounter I was well positioned to stave off the enemy with my tank. The enemy mage saw this and cast a spell on him that swapped his position with a caged demon. I had to spend precious turns bashing the cage door open to escape while my squishy mages scattered.  The game is packed with these kinds of fun moments and turns and those were all within the first couple hours of play. Larian took what already worked in D:OS, improved it, and then fixed a lot of what didn't work. I have no idea how the co-op is but I imagine it will be excellent."

I've got to say that this game is one of the best for its price range, there's so much content in this game its crazy and its all voice acted :DD. Larian studio's really out did themselves with this game, if I had completed every single possible side quest/content before the main story finishes we are looking into 150hours plus (on honour mode which I play) or 100 hours plus on any other difficulty whilst reading dialogue etc.. This game is best played with friends as the character interactions/dialogue is top notch and provide really fun role playing. However I played by myself as I wanted to get immersed and finish the game on the hardest difficulty due feelings of it being rushed if I played with more people.   it took me 52 hours to complete the game doing story mission only with 1 origin character story (Lohse completed) as well as critical side quests that are blocking my way to the main quest. I'm also playing on Honour Mode difficulty(if your whole party dies you save is wiped), basically I have to play very safe ( I died quarter way in the game, salty af).   This game is worth every penny and its price tag just beats some of AAA games on global top sellers on steam for content/replayability to price ratio.

Numerous improvements have been made since the last game (Divinity Original Sin). The Textures and animations are amazing. Also There seems to be a much more deep combo system compared to the last game which will make for some fantastic experamentation. Combat is still very interesting with most encounters resulting in different choices by the Enemy AI which ""spices"" up engagments.   Pros   The Characters and Dialoge are of course very good, with all of the origin characters having interesting backgrounds. your choices are questioned by your party memebers and many of them have different veiws, as they should.  The Skills and combos are fantastic and really fun to use although you will need to remember that your combos can be exploited or even used agaisnt you by the enemy Ai.  Armor and weapons look great and there seems to be a wide variety of different skins for each type of weapon.  While i did not explore the crafting system as much as i should have its pretty much the same as the last game. Although there are supposed to be way more (items etc) that we can craft.  The sound affects and the soundtrack are just as catchy and cool as last time. (GIVE ME THE SOUNDTRACK)  Cons.   Some enemy types have almost unfair adavantages against a party of any compsition, namley the undead and or necromancers/witches. Undead/ dark magic users, can both heal from poison and blood, as well as regular healing spells, which really just makes the battle alot longer than it needs to be. Ive never been a fan of undead being able to use the Hydro Healing spells. They should benfit from blood/poison fields/ spells only.  The Ui Still needs a bit of improvement as the item management system is still not that great. But is ok. It is very simplistic/minimalistic which is fine but we will need access to a universal chest of some sort to store our materials and such in. Or multiple backpacks will need to be equipped to carry most of your loot /items. Rather than turning one character into a pack mule or having lots of items spread out around multiple characters.      "

Ridiculous Primate,17,2,0,"October 30, 2017",Recommended,276.4,"This game is one of my favorites of all time now. The world is immersive and beautiful.  The battles are challenging yet rewarding.  I played through it on Tactician mode  out of the gate because I beat the first game on Tactician mode and figured I'd master this in no time too.  The difficulty was surprising at times.  But one thing that I really liked about the difficulty was that it didn't rely on RNG for everything.  There are a few RNG elements, but for the most part the fights are designed to be beaten by strategy and predicting what the enemies would do. The over arching story was pretty classic, but what made me really love it was the companion stories.  They were really interesting and I really loved them.  Some people on here have commented that the companions don't interact much, and while I would have loved for them to interact more than they did, I feel like their stories cross over a lot.  For example Sebille and the Red Prince's stories straight up merge near the end if you are playing with them both in the party. I would suggest taking Lohse in your party too, because her personal quest is one of the best. I know there are still some bugs, and those can be frustrating. I know it uses some classic tropes, but classic tropes are classic for a reason.  Sometimes when you try  to reinvent the wheel you end up making a block of rock. The game also does successfully reinvent the wheel at a few points. I played it all through tactician mode and felt it was a good difficulty considering I took the hardest option.  If you are playing a game on the hardest setting you should expect to have to fight some fights multiple times to master them, and it makes me so happy that I never felt like I was just flipping a coin to win a fight.  Every decision in fights matters a lot. It's not a perfect game, but no game has ever been perfect.  This game is pretty damn good though, and if they fixed the broken quests and bugs I would put it in my top 5 RPGs instantly.  My major complaint about this game is that there isn't more of it.  I can't wait for some DLC."
Atara Mos,174,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,147.3,"I had played the prior game and was encouraged to pick this game up in Beta because of the promise of having more than just one friend join you. In the Beta alone I have over 30 hours of play time, and we barely got out of the first area. That isn't a bad thing at all! That is a testament to the variety of ways that you can do things. We wanted to try all the different classes, the different racial traits, the different talents. The addition of a single talent can entirely change how the story plays out, which dramatically increases replayability. You're presented with multiple ways to resolve your quests, and each are different and can have influence on multiple aspects of your character. Despite the 30+ hours in beta I still found entirely new things in release.  The story is rich and deep because of how so much of your character influences different interactions and what you find along the way. The combat being turn based is a lot more thoughtful than just running up and bashing your strongest skill, you can truly use the environment to your advantage, or accidentally screw yourself over with it if you aren't careful.  It really harkens back to the classic rpgs of the past in such a great way.  My only real critique is that the learning curve is sort of steep to start, camera movement isn't the most intuitive and takes a bit to figure out the finessing of it, as the tutorial is minimal. This can lead to some funny interactions, though, as you figure out that maybe red outlined things aren't the best thing to click on with others around."
No Name Salted Butter,156,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,62.7,"Easily one of the best RPG's ever made.

The combat is tactical and challenging while also rewarding, the characters are interesting, the world is beautiful and fleshed out, and overall the game once it was fully released is polished and well worth the wait and money put into it.

Every aspect is of such high quality: the dialogue, the voice acting, the music, the excellent UI, the art style, the graphics, the amazing combat mechanics, the sense of exploration and adventure, the level design, the encounter design, the pacing... it's all super well done, way above what you normally get in an rpg.   There's such a large amount of things to find, places to explore, animals to talk to (If you have the required talent) and let‚Äôs not forget, towns filled with victims to pickpocket!   There are so many different classes you can have and you're not limited in any way, you could be a rogue necromancer or a tank archer if you wanted.   I'm 60+ hours in and it has not gotten tedious or started to feel formulaic or repetitive, which is something that I've never seen happen in a long single player game either.  The side stories, environments and things you do are varied enough to feel fresh after 60+ hours, the sense of exploration and adventure never goes away.   Every time you level up or progress further in the story you are rewarded with new spells and abilities that keep expanding on the combat and allowing you to experiment and try new builds and tactics, which keeps you from falling into familiar combat patterns/habits and keeps you entertained.   Watch on youtube some gameplay, buy the game. This is one game you won‚Äôt regret buying.  "
Dr. Nitr√≥geno,162,2,0,April 15,Recommended,71.3,"Very good game. I played the first one with my girlfriend and the co-op experience of two Lone Wolves was amazing, the second part is the same but with more content, nothing more.  Pros:  - Split Screen for PC - Very good Graphics - Unique storytelling and situations. - Best combat in a RPG so far (Sorry for the RTWP lovers) - Pet Pal Talent - Wells - Very good customization of characters, the magic mirror is amazing. - Very well optimized, the game runs smooth with a GTX770 in ultra, only few freezes in split screen.  Cons:   - ORIGINS, I don't like premade characters, if you choose lone wolf you skip a very big part of the game. - No Linux support. Seriously Larian? I needed to make a partition only to play the game. - Poor localization. I'm a native spanish speaker (I'm from Spain), for me english is not an issue but it is for my girlfriend...  Anyways, the game is one of the best RPG ever made, for me it's better than BG2 and Vampire: TMB.

As an example of the freedom provided, here is an example quest you would encounter: There is an <enemy> you were sent to kill because he stole the <quest giver's> <item> and you are to return said item to the quest giver:  - receive objective and start quest - straight up complete quest the way it was asked of you - OR talk to someone the ""right"" way and learn info that complicates things - OR find evidence through explorations that complicates/benefits/hinders things - OR depending on what character you chose in the beginning, <quest giver> or <enemy> might have history with you and attack/help/trust/not trust/give additional quest/etc - OR you had already stumbled upon that <enemy> and killed him already so you get the reward - OR you had already stumbled upon that <enemy> and he gave you a quest to kill the <quest giver> before the <quest giver> could talk to you - OR you decide to lie to <quest giver> and say you killed <enemy> but he didn't have the item just to get a half reward - OR persuade <enemy> to just give you the item back and leave town/apologize/fake his death/etc - OR you kill <enemy> and tell <quest giver> that <enemy> didn't have the item on him and you keep the item for yourself - OR you sneak up and pickpocket <enemy> and take <item> without killing him and return the <quest giver> and return <item> (and/or lie about killing <enemy>) - OR you kill/steal from <enemy>, return <item> to <quest giver>, recieve reward, THEN pickpocket <quest giver> and take the item back for yourself - OR tell the guards that <enemy> stole and the guards will kill him for you  - OR lure <enemy> near the guards, get <enemy> to attack you, and have the guards finish him - OR teleport <enemy> to <quest giver> with a power you learned and get them to fight it out themselves - etc etc etc  That's just the options with this one scenario. There are many more diverse quests that you can use your imagination + character skills + game mechanics to solve in a way that seems natural, inventive, beneficial, or just fun. This is expounded when you add in the Game Master mode that essentially lets you control every aspect of the game (map, story, dialogue, enemies, items, encounters, hidden secrets, etc etc) and even dnd aspects like die rolls for choices/actions to allow literally whatever solution you can imagine.  I haven't even touched the diversity of combat or skills or items or interactivity of the world or the many different paths you can take in the game, but there are plenty of other reviews that go in depth on those.

Of all the RPG's I've played (Elder Scrolls, Dragon Age, Witcher, KOTOR, Mass Effect, etc) this is the only game I can say has true and absolute freedom. The diversity and posibilities are endless making replayabilty not only valid but also incredibly unique and fun. The characters are fantastic and I am taken aback at how differently NPC's reacts to each one of your companions and your own created character depending on traits and race. With beautiful graphics, engaging lore, fantastic devs, a perfected co-op, and the ever-interesting world of Rivellon to explore I hope to see this game live on as legendary new standard for role playing games.

Yes, there are some little things that could be better, like every now and then a movement using a ladder would completely throw away the movement range that was visually given to us in the first place, but nothing that was really strong enough to prevent the overall great enjoyment of this excellent title.

Thy Nugget,75,2,0,February 7,Recommended,125.8,very good
Draceon,77,2,0,February 16,Recommended,22.3,"Story For those who love games like Skyrim, The Witcher, and Dragon Age, this game will be a welcome addition to your arsenal. It possesses background and history which I might in some cases call even better than any of the aforementioned games. Though much is left open to interpretation, the game does provide the player with a handfull of hints. and information. Its not so much that the story is more developed, after all Skyrim, The Witcher, and Dragon Age all have plenty of lore associated with them. However, Divinity has a better way of enticing the player to want to know more. The game isn't simply about finishing the main storyline, its more about the exploration of the world along the way. Your team will have certain skillsets, including a skill called loremaster which allows the player to learn about ancient, newly discovered artifacts. Each race has their own history and the relations between the races continue to devlop and become more known throughout the game. The game feels linear without feeling as though it limits the player, and I find this to be a great thing.  Controls and Perspective One ting that deterred me from playing more of this game earlier was the strange third person perspective, I am not personally used to this top down way of playing and pathfinding issues were sometimes a problem, though they were almost always solvable. It doesn't seem as engaging without the first person view, and in some ways seems more like a MOBA such as League of Legends in the way that the player sees the game. However, the game does allow the player to zoom in to see quite a lot more detail in the character models and the surroundings. It also uses some interesting post processing techniques to blur the backgrounds and have characters stand out when zooming in. However, its easy to get used to andn though perhaps not as immersive as Skyrim and The Witcher, it certainly has its benefits, particularly as pertaining to the combat system, which I will come to later.   Character Creation and Teams There are four races that can be played in the game, each have their skeletal variants which are also playable, these 4 species are dwarves, elves, humans, and lizards. Lizards are my personal favorite, I find them to look quite cool. However, who you pick and how you build them is completely up to you. Your decisions to upgrade certain skills, the race you choose, and the ability you decidie to learn all influence how the game progresses. Lorewise, Lizards are nobles and are often disliked because of their snobbish nature. Elves can eat flesh and learn about what that person was last doing, dwarves seem to be rather talkative, and humans are, well, boring. Because they're human. But while who you choose to play matters, you can still adopt team members from various different races and backgrounds and get their benefits. They can have all manner of classes and specializations. You can be a necromancer, reanimating the dead and using them for your advantage, sucking the life out of your enemies. You can cast air or fire spells to destroy your enemies. Or you can hit people with swords and arrows, definitely not as epic, but still quite important.  Combat System This combat system is one of the most unique, but challenging ones I've seen in a while. I thought turn based had to mean something along the lines of Civ V, but it really doesn't. Turn based combat really adds strategy to this game, you have to position your mages, rangers, assassins, and fighters correctly in order to be able to deal the most damage and keep your team alive. With such a diverse amount of spells and weapons, everything brings something new to the table. There is no undo button and making the wrong choices can lead to costly issues. However, a teammate dieing does not necessarily mean they are dead forever, a resurrection scroll can bring them back to life without too many issues. However, they do take some materials to craft or a lot of money to create.  Choices Matter Each dialogue, every upgrade, every step in combat seems to matter. When a player is given a choice, it is usually important for some reason. Thats part of what I love about this game so much, everything I do can lead to a different outcome. No game gives the player so many possibilities while still holding true to a definite storyline. However, your choices in skills start to matter less in the second act where you can just change your appearance and reallocate skill points. I like being able to change your appearance, but I don't think that reallocating skill points is the best idea. Though I have used it plenty, I feel like it takes away from some of the gravity that your choices have. It does however provide more freedom to change and evolve, which I can't argue with.  Crafting and Trading Yes, this game has crafting, and I'm not quite sure it was a good idea. One issue with this game in particular is that enemies don't respawn, so once you have cleared a camp and killed some enemies, they will never come back. You are essentially done with that zone. And this wouldn't be a problem considering how long it takes to finish the game and that there are so many places to visit, but it doesn't truly favor crafting. Though crafting is a good addition to almost any game, I don't find myself using it that much, the one time I have used it was for a quest. Considering how many items I get all the time from loot, it also doesn't really seem necessary to be crafting in this game. Would there be more opportunity to settle down and if this were more like a sandbox game, then the crafting system would make a lot more sense. I'm not saying this game shouldn't have one, I'm just saying that it doesn't really add to the experience like everything else does. When traidng with NPCs, you often get far less than an item is worth and the items you buy can cost 6-8 times as much. I know a lot of games charge these ridiculous in game prices with the in game currency and you can decrease cost with a skill, but I find this a bit excessive.   The Best Skill No doubt, the best skill is being able to talk with animals. It opens up new quests and oppprtunities, get it on at least one character, its called pet pal. I feel like this should come equipped by default with the main character as it is really important.  Summary All in all this is an absolutely wondeful game, with amazing graphics and intense storyline and lore. You're getting a fully fledged RPG on the level of other triple AAA titles. The player truly gets a sense of freedom whilst still being casually pushed in a direction. Each choice matters, each choice changes an outcome, and everything depends on the players playstyle and preference. Nothing in the story seems out of place, everything fits together, and the only limit to playing through this game is the willingness of those who wish to look deeper into the story. If you like a good/solid rpg game that isn't the standard shooter or hack and slash, then this is a game for you!"

This is my first CRPG and I was eased right in, the story is just the icing on the cake that is the combat.  Edit:  So after finishing this game I can undoubtedly say that this is one of my favorite games of all time. Not many games make you wanna start a new run again, specially those which are 100+ hrs long. That says quite a lot about this game. The replay value is amazing."

Horse with a Horn__,88,2,0,"November 19, 2017",Recommended,60.2,"Best game in a long time! Im playing Splitscreen with a friend of mine from couch using a steam controller. This works great!  I also played Divinity Original Sin 1 and als ready had a lot of fun there. Unfortunatly i never completed it, because i was missing a stone shard, that ive never found.  But i have to say THIS is way more casual than the first part. It is easier to get into, but still the quest are missing categorization to side or main quest and we got stuck some times (but way less than in Divinity 1).  Pros: + Splitscreen for 2 Players + can be fully played with only 2 characters using ""lonewolf"" ability. (2 Player 2 charaters is a good setup and the lonewolf makes it pretty easy in some parts of the game) + large worlds giving a lot of playtime and discovery. + all RPG elements are very well implemented (Looting and Leveling is as it shoudl be, most important and fun) + a lot of side storys and word telling, giving you a great feeling for the world youre playing in  Cons: - Some minor bugs. I got totally stuck one time! Make sure to save as often as you can - really annoying popup window, everytime i start. TO ALL WHO SAY THEIR GAME DOESNT WORK: it is probably this. The game tries to connect to some sort of service, which fails. Make sure to have .NET framework installed. Start the game, wait 2mins, try to start it again. then the popup should show. Click ""OK"" and the game shoudl start. - The quests are not obvious. It is always a problem to know what to do, in order to solve them, also a lot of quests interfer with each other, which leads to quests cannot be closed and so on. If you are stuck lookup the internet. I dont think its possible to completely fail the main quest though.   Conclusion: This is a great game and if you got a real life friend who also loves RPGs, grab 2 controllers and play, you will not regret it. I have not tried playing it Single Player."

Quests with meaningful choices and justifications, thought-out and deep skill combos that affect your playstyle and experience in combat, a surprisingly intriguing and not at all by-the-numbers story and absolutely NO handholding.  Everything that is great and wonderful about character driven RPGs is here and fleshed out,  I believe I've finally found the game that will let me retire from reinstalling Neverwinter Nights again for good. The only thing I wish they had done is let you roam the entire world like in Original Sin; the chapters are separate areas. They provide ample warning before you leave an area though, so it's not like it's a frustrating mechanic!  There have been complaints about the difficulty of not only the combat but also in solving the puzzles; If you're struggling to solve a puzzle it's because you haven't found all the clues; they're always there somewhere. if you can't beat a particular enemy because he's too strong you're gonna have to come back to him later. The game won't coddle you, you're supposed to learn how to defeat different enemy combinations through hard work and experimentation! The game is equal parts merciless and forgiving, enlightening and mystifying, challenging and fun.   A must-buy, and above all else; we must have a sequel, Larian!  The holiday is over, get back to work developer slaves!"

Dais Spires,41,2,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,51.8,"I love this game. I played the first one for a long time so I was already a fan, but this one is better then the first by far. I love the new class skills, the new races, and simplified crafting system. The game is appropriately difficult, and you will most likely have to do some battles more then once to figure it out. So save often. Build craft is so much fun in the game, and the replay value is very clear from the start. I keep wanting to make new characters just to try things differently. I love Love LOVE playing a Rouge. Teleporting, sneaking, stealing and back-stabbing. It's just the best.   The multiplayer in this game is a lot of fun too. I play with my husband for hours on our days off. We yell at eachother from other rooms to try and figure out a strategy, or when one of use screws up and kills the other. I feel like you wanna play this with someone you really like though, because the first time they accidentally stun you, and ruin your big attack you've been setting up, you'll wanna kill them. I am very glad this game is Co-op though. We need more games like this in the world.   So, get this game. You already want to, or else you wouldn't be here. Just do it. You won't regret it, and if you do, then there is something wrong with you. This game is amazing."

sexyb[A]boy,113,2,0,January 1,Recommended,281.5,What do you get when DnD is ported into the digital world? Answer: Divinity: Original Sin 2. The game capitalizes on turn-based combat and does it right. The world is vast and there are countless personalities and quests to encounter. I'm only around 12 hours in and I know this game is gonna take up most of my time for the coming months. If you enjoy captivating story-telling and nail-biting action then this title is for you.  Pros: 1. Amazing story-telling that is so good you have to listen to what this person/creature has to say 2. Interesting preset characters to choose from or interact with 3. Complex but understandable progression system 4. Various spells that can change the tide of battle 5. Dozens and dozens of items that all have their purpose 6. Stunning graphics that bring the game to life 7. The Narrator describes the scenarios and situation in great fashion 8. You can talk to pigs/squirrels/cats 9. You can talk to cats 10. I already love DnD  Cons: 1. Not enough races to choose from (IMO) 2. Heavy lore may not be appealing to newcomers 3. I killed a wounded soldier who was in the way only to find out his family was excited that he was coming back home (That cut deep)  10/10. GOTY worthy.

CosmoCorgi,35,2,0,"November 8, 2017",Recommended,68.2,"If you are a fan of turn-based combat and an RPG that allows creativity instead of limiting it; if you like a game with a decent story, but really are looking for deep game mechanics; if you are looking for an RPG that will allow you to have drop-in and drop-out co-op seamlessly; if you are into D&D and want to make your own D&D map.... THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.  I haven't completed the game yet, but from what I have seen it is definitely my new favorite game of all time. The amount of fun that I have with this game reminds me of when I first picked up Dragon Age Origins. You can create any type of character you want and even change it later if you aren't happen with your choices. The game doesn't really hold your hand, which is nice, and there are many ways to strategize a battle -- use your imagination! If you have a character that is sneaking around you can initiate combat with your other characters and have that sneaky character get into position before engaging.   The crafty is really tricky in the sense that it doesn't really help you. You can pick up books that give you recipes, but if you don't find any books you wont know how to make certain things. There are guides online to help in this regard, however. The amount of things you can craft is seemingly endless. Dozens of spells are craft only spells!  Try a playthrough by yourself to get your bearings, or jump into a game with a guide and have them show you the ropes. The game is best with friends, but it still enjoyable by yourself.  There are bugs, but it is to be expected. Updates are quick and the developer actually listens to the players.  8.5/10"

Scooty,51,2,0,September 5,Recommended,56.6,"Not a title for 100%ers or the very tactical.  This is fun on it's own AND there is a Dungeon Master mode I havnt used yet. Downside is sort of strange fiction where clerics heal by sucking blood off the ground? Very detailed but still odd to me. Fun game.  I'm having an issue where I get jumped by badguys near the edge of town. I run into town and stand next to a town guard.  I stay in combat because exiting teleports you like fast travel. He is still out there watching me get beaten down in front of him while never ever attacking the guy burning EVERYTHING. (the fire does nothing to the guards and townsfolk not in combat yet hugging)  So there is that. Still a good game.  This is quickly turning into a feces title.  In sneak as a barrel tucked in a corner behind a tent BUT the guard detect vision goes through that type of object.   So much saving and loading because of lack of polish.  For instance just now; a fading mine that cloaks when your near.  -I saw it and manuver my man to a point where straight line in a safe corridor was the direct path. -I click the destination and my digidal dynamo heads off straight as an arrow like planned, only to vear 45* left straight into the mine blowing it and dodging a terrifying patch of THIN AIR!

Zealous,48,2,1,"November 8, 2017",Recommended,389.0,"Honestly, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a fun game. It has a solid story, good character design, and a plethora of items and quests. It kept me busy for a good couple weeks, and entertained me the whole time. The combat system is entertaining, if a bit challenging, and the world is large and fun to explore, packed with secrets and quests. There are so many choices when picking a character. In general, the game offers lots of choices, but there are so many character combinations it's almost hard to decide what you want to do, so you just make a few characters and play the game twice. It also has great modding community, and all it's other modes are solid as well. It does suffer from some issues though. The UI needs a bit of work, some areas are laggy, some hitboxes are confusing, and the journal sometimes doesn't provide enough information. It's not a perfect game. However, it is relatively new. GIve it time, and I guarantee, all these minor issues will be fixed. The only real issue I have with the game is the ending. You get your final battle and all, but in the end, all that happens is that you hear about what happened to everyone after the events of the game, and some of it sounds like fun, to be honest. All in all, this is a solid gaming experience and a must play for any fan of the RPG genre. It is worth the price."

TheCynicalTaco,154,2,0,February 3,Recommended,237.1,"I've got to say that after 200 hours of experiencing this game and trying out different means of playing, I've encountered an experience like no other. It is obvious that the developers of this game have put in their hearts to making a game that best suits the wants of a community of tired gamers who just wanted the freedom to make decisions, to customize their gameplay, and have a fully immersive story all along the way. Not only that, but this game will introduce you to new and interesting game mechanics that are both a pleasure to play with and against. When things go wrong in the game, you can't help but laugh it off because you are fully aware that your faults lay in your own mistakes or lack of understanding about certain core mechanics. However frustrated you may get at something or upset with yourself for having made some mistake, the game is interesting and engaging enough to motivate you to try again and learn from your mistakes. This game is definitely a must buy for any rpg lover.  If there is one thing I can hope to see in the future, it is official DLC. I would love to experience new classes, new abilities, new gear, and new stories. It would be nice to have a playthrough of the ""enemy's"" side since even many of the enemies can be misunderstood or mislead. Also, a story revolving around the races that aren't present in this game could make for more gameplay and story without taking away from the existing one. Finally, more emphasis on the cooking/crafting system would be warranted. As it stands, crafting is not very important as you can find everything that is craftable and more. One of the only important recipes you need to know: Shoes + Nails = saved lives."

Owning Duck,73,2,0,"November 2, 2017",Recommended,364.0,"This game is now my most favorite game, I played DOS twice, one playthrough by myself (150 hours) and one with my friend (60 hours). I can say that I really enjoyed the first game and was really looking forward to DOS 2. I'm almost 200 hours into it and I am not even done with the campaign. But being nearly done I think I can give a proper review.  Combat: So most people criticize the game for being turn-based rather than a real-time with pause function. But it feels right in place as the combat still feels so engaging. The combat is tougher since a lot of skills that you have, the enemies have as well. This makes the combat harder but also more rewarding once you get past it. The game is hard yet fair. There are fights that seem impossible but the game provides us with the tools to win or hides the tools within the world. A lot of the skills feel strong and useful. But towards the end game, I find that magic damage started to be more obsolete as it is much faster and easier to physical as that it the most reliable way to damage. Though that might be because my team consisted of 3 physical dealers and one wizard.  Story: This is by far my favorite part of the game. The story is rather simple yet done in a way that makes it compelling. And as someone who played the other Divinity games, there are a lot of surprising plot twists that I was surprised by. But where the game shines the most is the origin stories. You can either create your own character or choose one of 6 pre-made origin characters that have their own backgrounds. And and these stories are very well-written with equally well made characters. It is so interesting to see how much the game changes because of who you are. If you didn't pick an origin character, you can still recruit them but after a certain point, they will become unavaible. It is a rather intersting thing of being a side character to the origin character's stories though. And each origin chracter will have a personal quest which will result in some drastic endings. But some advice, do not play as Lohse. Not because she is bad, she is a great character with a one of my favorite stories. But Lohse is best when played as a companion and her personal ending yields the best reward a video game has ever given.  UI: I will be blunt about it, it's bad. Inventory management is a nightmare. Sadly it is also required in powering up your weapons in the end game. You will spend a long time in your inventory looking through it to find a single item. Crafting can be done through a seperate menu but most of the time you will be combing random stuff together and that is horrible. In the end game, you will have so much clutter mostly involving books and paper with no swift and reliable way to dispose of them.   Other Notes: The game has quite alot of bugs as well. The first area will be rather polished because it was in early access for a long time. But the game is large and some parts are even broken at times. But I would like to say that I have not faced a bug bad enough to take away from my enjoyment. The game is best played (in my opinion) with a roll with it attitude. Just accept mistakes that happen. It is really fun to see all my mistakes bite me in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•later down the line. And before I forget, the soundtrack. It is a masterpiece. DOS 2 has a different composer from the past Divinity games (RIP Kirill) but the new composer has truly put his heart and soul into it and it is an absolute joy to listen to.   Just buy the game. Larian deserves all of the praise and hopefully they will make a console version so we all can share in the masterpiece that is Divinity Original Sin."

Strategy is the key to complete this game. The game already begins at your character creation screen, where there are options like: Race, Talents, Abilities, Skills, Class etc. given to you. Everything you choose from here on will change the way you interact with the world. This makes this game so unbelievably huge. You can interact with literally everyone, you have the option to kill or spare one's life, there are multiple ways to complete a quest etc. But the most important thing of all: ""eveything you choose to do has its consequenses."" For instance, if you scold a character he will not like you therefore he won't trade with you no more. Or if you kill a character, you won't be able to finish a questline.

pinkpinnn,248,2,0,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,122.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 - 2017 GEM.  Finding a game that mixes RPG, D&D, customizable class/ characters, good story telling, beautiful aesthetics, crafting system, tactical turn based battle, and option to play co-op? This game pretty much offers it all up on a silver plate.  I've played the first Divinity Original Sin, and my impression of that wasn't so strong, however I decided to give this a try, and it definitely floored me.  None too many games I've played have done a swell job in buffing lores, stories, and open ended quests for you to explore. You don't have to be a lore-lover or a rouge type gamer to enjoy this. There's a sweet spot for everyone. I went looking for a plain old adventure-with-consequences game, and spent more time reading up short lores here and there instead of speeding through it.  I can't believe I've spent 80+ hours (solo play) and still haven't completed it yet. Actually for the first chapter, I managed to spend 8-9 hours (and this was just purely exploring and figuring out quests). Halfway through the game, it even conjured up my nostalgia for Dragon Age 1.   CONS/ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  -Sometimes there are NO warnings before huge consequences take place. And when it happens, it's too late to alter (unless you are bothered to load up a game save 1 hour ago+). This happened a few times for me, the most painful one for me being: I couldn't take my companions to the next chapter because I'd missed that one window to convince them. They were absolutely gone. I loaded a previous save, but ever since that happened, I ended up tracking quests on wikia instead in fear of a major slip up -Quest journals are sometimes vague, and you will be left wondering or wiki-ing what the next step should be -Some quests feel un-finished or un-polished, as there may only be ONE, OBSCURE way of completing it -Not a must, but nice to have: Camera angle needs more rotation flexibility -No option to hide the HUD  PROS:  -The battle system constantly makes you look for the best spots to prepare and engage. Whenever you think you've got your ""go-to"" strategies nailed down, the game manages to switch it up just a little to make it challenging (+fun) again -Attention to detail towards the environment and the overall atmosphere. I don't always stop and look at the shadows of leaves and trees in a game. Each chapter is a map with it's own characteristics -Memorable background sound and music <3 Well done Borislav Slavov  -EVERY character has a voice! And voice acting is just ace -Main companions have decent back stories, although 1 or 2 still seem like pompous ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s after 20 hours -HIGH replayability value -Co-op offers extra fun if you want play with you rmates, and most things work smoothly. Just take note of the connectivity menu, and make sure to set your game privacy, as random people can enter your game and hijack your acharacter completely. -Dungeon master mode! For those who are into D&D this might be an interesting mode to check out  TO THINK THIS GAME WAS BACKED BY A KICK STARTER AND DEVELOPED + LAUNCHED UNDER 3 YEARS!  It's not easy balancing and taking in multiple opinions and ideas and delivering on something this decent. I suspect good team work somewhere in Larian Studios. The game is decent enough for me to overlook the annoying flaws (for now). And major game developing companies? You guys better brush up your A game. Top notch graphics aren't the only thing that makes a game immersive and great.  ANYWAYS...JUST...Just ..go play it!"
Sandwich Boy,400,2,0,March 13,Recommended,27.6,"This is one of the most immersive games I've played in years.  The graphics are great for a CRPG, the story is engrossing, and every line of dialogue is fully voiced.  There is so much depth in every aspect of the game.  The character customization, crafting system, and combat are some of the best I've seen in any game, let alone any CRPG.  Combat encounters are difficult without feeling unfair.  Others may feel differently, but as a casual player, I found the ""classic"" difficulty setting to be just about perfect.  Combat is turn-based, but it is sort of a mix between tactical turn-based combat, and the classic RTS-Style combat of games such as Baldur's Gate. Players are definitely rewarded for being creative in combat, so simply running the party headlong into an encounter isn't always the best strategy.  The Divinity world has some interesting twists on the generic fantasy setting.  Each quest and side quest feels unique, and characters (even minor characters), are interesting and realistic.  This game also has some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in an rpg, which is crazy, given how much dialogue there is.  The attention to detail is absolutely amazing, resulting in tons of secrets to uncover in the world, as well as complex interactions between items, characters, etc.  Here's a fun example: When a character is wounded in (or out) of combat, blood can splatter onto the ground.  This blood can be frozen, resulting in a slippery patch of ice on the ground, or struck with a bolt of lightning, shocking anyone who is touching the puddle.  The blood could also be absorbed for health by a necromancer.  Somehow the game doesn't feel like it has a steep learning curve, despite all of this richness and complexity.  There's a lot more to say, but I'll keep this review short.  If you have any interest in CRPGs, or RPGs in general, you should check this game out."

Mokona,31,2,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,22.7,"This review is just based on my first impressions of the game. Its worth getting.  There is an insane amount of skills and combos you can do that a single play through will never allow you to see all the cool stuff you can do so the replay value is high. My favorite thing I've discovered in the game is the way recruiting followers works. First you must convince them to follow you to begin with, they dont just come along because you are the ""chosen one"" or some crap. To boot if you like a character you dont have to worry about him being a mage when you are already a mage because each character asks you what you want them to be. No longer are you forced to not take your favorite npc with you or forced to play a class you dont like just to take it with you. You can finally have a balanced party full of npc you find interesting hurrah.  The only thing I would ""complain"" about is the lack of non human races. You got human, dwarf (small human), elf (vegetarian human), and lizard man (finally its not a human). Skeleton variations of all is nice to throw in but I honestly am just done with every fantacy game haveing there races be the 3 over used races, human, elf, dwarf, and then a final race being there own ""custom"" race that just turn out to be another human but blue or something like that. Glad we got lizard men but wish we had a few more.  This game has a lot of thought put into it and it somehow didn't lauch at the $60 price point, with mod support. I expected this to be as dissapointing as pillars of eternity was but just jumping into the character creation and I was already loving the game."

Ardis,193,2,0,"December 5, 2017",Recommended,200.8,"After playing dozens of hours with my buds across a few different timezones I can honestly say that this game has brought us fun and memories few others have. The combat is engrossing, satisfying, and keeps you talking. You are encourged to work together and experiment, and the massive freedom of choice in the game means you'll never know what someone is going to get your party into. However, that same freedom can also mean that you aren't always clear on the ""right"" way to go, so you might spend some time exploring or consulting guides. You can always make your own path if you want to though.   There were a few odd bugs. One of my friends was having issues with his inventory just dissapearing. Reloads didn't fix it and he was unable to use any items. During combat, things aren't always crystal clear on what you can hit and what is in range, so sometimes you just have to wing it. It usually works out though. Not many complaints from me on this one, it'll go down as one of my fondest multiplayer experiences ever. Thanks to the devs for giving me great times with my friends."

The sheer amount of work these people put into everything is immediately obvious from even the most cursory of glances, but you have to respect the business practices as well. Seriously. Larian runs a studio like a... Like a... Like a bunch of hardworking enthusiasts who respect their players.  Crazy, right?  At this point I would say ""compare that to a company like EA"", but that would be pointless. There isn't a comparison to be made. Free release of the Enhanced Edition for the first game, using Steam early access responsibly for the second, and releasing the entire game engine for you to learn and build your own content with?

I've also not made it past Fort Joy (the beginning right after the tutorial) yet as ive repeatedly restarted, playing around with different builds and such. But i am having a fantastic time with it. i havent enjoyed an RPG so much since Dragon Age Origins, nor have i wanted to smash my screen so much since initially discovering the Dark Souls games. I havent really played the first even though i own it so im not sure how it compares but i just might have to go play though it after this one.  Thank God for autosave, whether it be trying to survive an underground fight club at level 2-3 or dying to teleporting crocodiles, it has come in handy many times already.  I cant comment on the storyline so much yet as i havent really gotten into it yet but the origin stories seem interesting and custimization (even for origin characters) is fantastic.   In short if you enjoy RPG's and dont want to button smash your way to victory but actually use some strategy than this game is for you. You get a real feeling of accomplishment when you finally beat those ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• teleporting crocodiles after 30-45 mins and 5-6 reloads.

Luis,"2,122",2,0,"October 15, 2017",Recommended,240.2,"Absolutely incredible.  Basically feels like going from Baldur's Gate 1 to 2 (though not quite, since that was continuing from low level to midrange and then to epic levels with the same narrative, and this is not that), since the new armor system involves you either taking advantage or PEELING off layers of armor before you can actually do things.  Positioning and elemental manipulation are somehow even more important this time around. Fortunately, a lot of the difficult encounters are not initiated until you finish a dialog, so one has plenty of time to position  the party as one sees fit.  The original one was an amazing game that I spent hundreds of hours on, but never actually finished. This so far  is shaping up to be an even more impressive experience that I will revisit over and over.   That being said, it is slightly disappointing that the premade dwarf character has extremely little relevance to the plot until the 4th act, and then it is tangential. Oh well."

Hitch,25,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,102.8,"I purchased, but didn't log a ton of hours in the remastered first iteration of this game (36 hrs), but this 2nd one just feels right, and it's a homerun for Larian. I will start by saying I have only experienced the co-op of this game, which so far has been a load of fun to play with a good friend:   Areas to highlight:  The story telling is vastly improved, with exceptional voice dialogue (gaming industry wise). There are a ridiuclous amount of options for dialogue depending on your characters skills and tags. Rich orchestra sounds bring you back to some of your favorite RPGs of old. The game is gorgeous too, graphics are superb. Scenes are incredibly detailed, from brightly lit beach environments to dark, dreary dungeons. The mood is dark and sombre overall but clever writing adds in humor all along the way. HUD is intuitive and nothing new, co-op shared backpack screen is something to behold; very convenient. The combat is intuitive but high on difficulty, Larian does not hold your hand in this one. There are major things in the game that are not obvious which I won't spoil, and without the internet you'd miss a lot. Highly recommend playing without reading up on the game, it makes for a much better/realer experience. Those new to this type of game will repeat battles many times over on the harder difficulties. This is Turn-Based though, at it's best. Re-trying is half the fun, learning from your previous mistakes becomes essential. Winning a battle on the first go after using perfect tactics really feels satisfying.  Areas for Improvement:  We encountered minor bugs, a learned spell that wouldn't show up in the mage book, finishing a successful dialogue with a creature then clicking them again by accident only to have new dialogue that leads to a fight. Stuff that requires a reload but isn't game breaking, and occurs infrequently. The environment manipulation is incredible, and no other game has allowed players to control fights so well using it, however it becomes a bit too much at times with the blood, water and other puddles--often making magic-type characters useless since every attack hurts your friends and foes alike. Source spells are a great idea but would be nice to be able to use once per battle or game day. Current game makes it hard to accumulate source points for skills that truthfully really arent as impressively OP as they should be at that rarity. Lastly, the gold/bartering system needs a hotfix bad. You need to move a slider to hit exact gold value on both sides, without an option to go up by 1 or type in a value. This is a basic that has been overlooked.   Summary:  I look forward to logging many more hours before updating this review (so far at around 30 hrs). Recommended for anyone who loves old-school (or new) cRPGs or any 1-4 group of friends looking for a great game to co-op, just note it requires much focus, dialogue/reading and chatting, so I wouldn't recommend playing with a stranger. Also be prepared for 4 hr+ play times. It is almost impossible to make any progress in 1-2 hr playings. Congrats to Larian on a job well done, it's been one of the better RPG games I have played in years.  I would score D:OS2 9/10."

AWHILE!  I can think of 4 legendary games of the early 2000's, games that help set the foundation to gaming and its take off over a decade ago. These games of the past are a staple to our [gaming community] foundation. Though apparently forgotten by history if I judged soley at the sore site of 90% of AAA game developers today..  Thes dev's of Divinity OSII, Larian Studios did not forget what gaming was and still is suppose to be.    I don't know if resemblance was intentional but I can't help but think of a few games that this game reminds me of however, often I don't hold it to that and because I just want to play Diviniy II, as Divinity II. I wont describe it (being the games it resembles and the game itself) because I feel that takes away from the spectacular creation that is Divinity Original Sin II, after all. the creators have no doubt been influenced, but in the best ways ever possible.  They took glorious ancient concepts and with a few unique features I've only see them do, and make it all their own. Plus it is a game you will have enjoyed 10 to 100 if not 1000 times more if you just go in. Maybe watch the first steam video like I did, but that's all I did and as a result I find something amazing.  This is... the best game I have played in over a decade.   And by the time I'm done with it. Which will be awhile- I am looking forward to say, it is the best game, I have played, ever. I will edit my review then, and untill then-  I just have to give it a thumbs up.  10/10"

Just the other day I started playing at 7pm and after what seemed like a few hours I looked down at my hands and noticed that they were considerably more wrinkled than before. I looked in a mirror and saw that I'd aged 60 years, my jowls sagged, leathery eyelids hung heavy over my now grey faded eyes. I looked outside and saw the changed world. The people wore such strange clothing, some wore suits of purple fur with their faces painted into crude animal caricatures, other people wore shoes on their hands and gloves on their feet, but nothing else. The world had changed so much, how long had I been playing Divinity? A single tear rolled down my cheek as flying automobiles whiz by my window.

THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.  I haven't completed the game yet, but from what I have seen it is definitely my new favorite game of all time. The amount of fun that I have with this game reminds me of when I first picked up Dragon Age Origins. You can create any type of character you want and even change it later if you aren't happen with your choices. The game doesn't really hold your hand, which is nice, and there are many ways to strategize a battle -- use your imagination! If you have a character that is sneaking around you can initiate combat with your other characters and have that sneaky character get into position before engaging.   The crafty is really tricky in the sense that it doesn't really help you. You can pick up books that give you recipes, but if you don't find any books you wont know how to make certain things. There are guides online to help in this regard, however. The amount of things you can craft is seemingly endless. Dozens of spells are craft only spells!  Try a playthrough by yourself to get your bearings, or jump into a game with a guide and have them show you the ropes. The game is best with friends, but it still enjoyable by yourself.  There are bugs, but it is to be expected. Updates are quick and the developer actually listens to the players.  8.5/10"

But as soon as I wake up, I find that all my stuff is stolen. There's 5 guys in my room that I don't know. Suprised I ask the lizard lady what's going on, she says she's sorry, but this is a setup.  I get angry, you can't fool me, you can't set me up! Naked and without any weapons I attack the robbers, and I kill them all, taking the weapons of their body to finish of the rest, and using my magic to dish out even more damage. In the end, they all drop dead and I'm victorious. I talk to the lizard lady to ask what just happened, she admits they tried to rob me. The smooth-talker I am decide to forgive her, and say it was worth it for the night I had. She liked what I said, I continue talking to her, we end up having another sexy night. Me covered in blood and my enemies dead on the floor.   10/10, most fun I've ever had in an RPG. Definitely worth the purchase."

Piett,145,2,0,"November 26, 2017",Recommended,75.3,"I'm playing this multiplayer with my friends and it is really way more fun than it should be. Combat misadventures to follow, but the story interaction that you can have is fantastic. If one player starts talking to an NPC you can listen to the whole exchange as well, complete with the voice acted NPC dialog. You can see where your friend's cursor is as they debate what dialog choice they want to reply with- we always end up talking about which one fits our ""attitude"" the most, which is fun in and of itself. You are never standing around while someone has an awesome dialog with ""their"" quest NPC while you do nothing; you can always listen in and hear the story.  Now on to the combat. The combat is really well done, especially the environmental variables and conditions. For instance, the classic Divinity situation of use lightning or cold on someone standing in water or wet and they will be stunned or frozen respectively is great for planning out how you are going to take on a group of enemies. Until someone in your group makes it rain on the battlefield and then uses chain lightning. Now, in addition to your foe being stunned, your allies are as well. I am not saying that I have been stunned or frozen a few times, but I have been stunned or frozen a few times.  Lots of quests and side quests and NPCs to do tasks for, and lots of different ways of completing the tasks as well. We are still in our first play-through but already planning out classes for our second. One of the short comings is related to the quests, specifically the quest log. It can be difficult to discern if a quest is active only because you did a part of it out of order, such as visiting an NPC before you should have, or if you have not done the criteria of the quest. It is not game braking but it is a little bit out of place due to how good the rest of the game is, UI included."

I have not went too deep into the game yet but it already feels great, and after full voice acting support I think they aced it pretty much. I like how open-ended the game has been so far.  Great Race-Class system Fully Voice Acted  Playable Undead Race Great Music Great Combat System (specially if you are into turn based combat)  Downside so far for me is the running around I have to do to get back a party member once I let go of them. I think once they join your party and you ask them to leave they all should wait at a specific location not back to where you found them.  If you loved Dragon Age Origins and also loved X-COM then this game is provides the fun of both worlds in my opinion.  9/10 for me."

Hitch,25,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,102.8,"I purchased, but didn't log a ton of hours in the remastered first iteration of this game (36 hrs), but this 2nd one just feels right, and it's a homerun for Larian. I will start by saying I have only experienced the co-op of this game, which so far has been a load of fun to play with a good friend:   Areas to highlight:  The story telling is vastly improved, with exceptional voice dialogue (gaming industry wise). There are a ridiuclous amount of options for dialogue depending on your characters skills and tags. Rich orchestra sounds bring you back to some of your favorite RPGs of old. The game is gorgeous too, graphics are superb. Scenes are incredibly detailed, from brightly lit beach environments to dark, dreary dungeons. The mood is dark and sombre overall but clever writing adds in humor all along the way. HUD is intuitive and nothing new, co-op shared backpack screen is something to behold; very convenient. The combat is intuitive but high on difficulty, Larian does not hold your hand in this one. There are major things in the game that are not obvious which I won't spoil, and without the internet you'd miss a lot. Highly recommend playing without reading up on the game, it makes for a much better/realer experience. Those new to this type of game will repeat battles many times over on the harder difficulties. This is Turn-Based though, at it's best. Re-trying is half the fun, learning from your previous mistakes becomes essential. Winning a battle on the first go after using perfect tactics really feels satisfying.  Areas for Improvement:  We encountered minor bugs, a learned spell that wouldn't show up in the mage book, finishing a successful dialogue with a creature then clicking them again by accident only to have new dialogue that leads to a fight. Stuff that requires a reload but isn't game breaking, and occurs infrequently. The environment manipulation is incredible, and no other game has allowed players to control fights so well using it, however it becomes a bit too much at times with the blood, water and other puddles--often making magic-type characters useless since every attack hurts your friends and foes alike. Source spells are a great idea but would be nice to be able to use once per battle or game day. Current game makes it hard to accumulate source points for skills that truthfully really arent as impressively OP as they should be at that rarity. Lastly, the gold/bartering system needs a hotfix bad. You need to move a slider to hit exact gold value on both sides, without an option to go up by 1 or type in a value. This is a basic that has been overlooked.   Summary:  I look forward to logging many more hours before updating this review (so far at around 30 hrs). Recommended for anyone who loves old-school (or new) cRPGs or any 1-4 group of friends looking for a great game to co-op, just note it requires much focus, dialogue/reading and chatting, so I wouldn't recommend playing with a stranger. Also be prepared for 4 hr+ play times. It is almost impossible to make any progress in 1-2 hr playings. Congrats to Larian on a job well done, it's been one of the better RPG games I have played in years.  I would score D:OS2 9/10."

Dragona,215,2,0,January 11,Recommended,231.8,"Overall, I really enjoyed this game. I loved the interaction with my companions and helping them with their personal quests. The main story was enjoyable but felt really rushed towards the end. I felt the final part of the game was a bit rushed in general. For example, I expected more from Arx. It felt small for a city (it didn't even have an inn!) and had a lot of wasted potentials which could have included more quests, storylines and more companion interaction. I loved the romance options in the game too as it felt more immersive but from Arx onwards, it seemed a bit lacklustre and the epilogue at the end was a bit of a let down as it felt as if any romance was dismissed to have a 'one-size fits all ending'. Also, I'm sure I'm not the only one who found Sebille very buggy regarding romance if you had her in your party but were not romancing her. She would seem to force kisses on you even if you were just being nice but still turning down her advances. Other than these grievances, I really enjoyed the game as I found combat to be very fun and at times, challenging. I completed it on classic difficulty so I'm hoping tactician will be challenging to progress. I also loved being able to build my character in any way I choose. My custom character ended up with a support/summoner/caster hybrid which was a lot of fun to play. I've also played some co-op which most ends up being hilarious with friends which usually ends up with us all being on a murder spree around Fort Joy due to one person's inability to steal successfully.  If I were to summarise: +Enjoyable story +Great companion interaction (wish there was more of it towards the end!) +Romance is great for adding a new dynamic to your companions. +Great combat +Great character customisation regarding class builds etc  -A lot of bugs that are immersion breaking or require a reload. -Feels rushed in the final act -No mention of the romance you created in the final epilogue  I would love to see a further expansion to this game, for example, being able to go to the desert areas that Prince or Ifan are originally from but understand that the multiple endings would make this difficult.

There is an insane amount of skills and combos you can do that a single play through will never allow you to see all the cool stuff you can do so the replay value is high. My favorite thing I've discovered in the game is the way recruiting followers works. First you must convince them to follow you to begin with, they dont just come along because you are the ""chosen one"" or some crap. To boot if you like a character you dont have to worry about him being a mage when you are already a mage because each character asks you what you want them to be. No longer are you forced to not take your favorite npc with you or forced to play a class you dont like just to take it with you. You can finally have a balanced party full of npc you find interesting hurrah.  The only thing I would ""complain"" about is the lack of non human races. You got human, dwarf (small human), elf (vegetarian human), and lizard man (finally its not a human). Skeleton variations of all is nice to throw in but I honestly am just done with every fantacy game haveing there races be the 3 over used races, human, elf, dwarf, and then a final race being there own ""custom"" race that just turn out to be another human but blue or something like that. Glad we got lizard men but wish we had a few more.  This game has a lot of thought put into it and it somehow didn't lauch at the $60 price point, with mod support. I expected this to be as dissapointing as pillars of eternity was but just jumping into the character creation and I was already loving the game."
Greatmar2,208,2,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,118.5,"Amazing game in which you can spend countless hours with friends in. So many different ways to play the main campaign.   D:OS2 also comes with a gamemaster mode for you to make quick and easy campaigns, editable on the fly by the game master, which you can play with friends.   Additionally, as a separate download, the devs made the tools that they used ot make the main campaign available for us to use.   As the game ages and people have time, I'm sure we will see some epic user-made campagins.  These games are a labour of love - the developers almost went bankrupt while making the first D:OS, but they still pushed on. I'm proud of what they've achieved."
Hitch,25,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,102.8,"I purchased, but didn't log a ton of hours in the remastered first iteration of this game (36 hrs), but this 2nd one just feels right, and it's a homerun for Larian. I will start by saying I have only experienced the co-op of this game, which so far has been a load of fun to play with a good friend:   Areas to highlight:  The story telling is vastly improved, with exceptional voice dialogue (gaming industry wise). There are a ridiuclous amount of options for dialogue depending on your characters skills and tags. Rich orchestra sounds bring you back to some of your favorite RPGs of old. The game is gorgeous too, graphics are superb. Scenes are incredibly detailed, from brightly lit beach environments to dark, dreary dungeons. The mood is dark and sombre overall but clever writing adds in humor all along the way. HUD is intuitive and nothing new, co-op shared backpack screen is something to behold; very convenient. The combat is intuitive but high on difficulty, Larian does not hold your hand in this one. There are major things in the game that are not obvious which I won't spoil, and without the internet you'd miss a lot. Highly recommend playing without reading up on the game, it makes for a much better/realer experience. Those new to this type of game will repeat battles many times over on the harder difficulties. This is Turn-Based though, at it's best. Re-trying is half the fun, learning from your previous mistakes becomes essential. Winning a battle on the first go after using perfect tactics really feels satisfying.  Areas for Improvement:  We encountered minor bugs, a learned spell that wouldn't show up in the mage book, finishing a successful dialogue with a creature then clicking them again by accident only to have new dialogue that leads to a fight. Stuff that requires a reload but isn't game breaking, and occurs infrequently. The environment manipulation is incredible, and no other game has allowed players to control fights so well using it, however it becomes a bit too much at times with the blood, water and other puddles--often making magic-type characters useless since every attack hurts your friends and foes alike. Source spells are a great idea but would be nice to be able to use once per battle or game day. Current game makes it hard to accumulate source points for skills that truthfully really arent as impressively OP as they should be at that rarity. Lastly, the gold/bartering system needs a hotfix bad. You need to move a slider to hit exact gold value on both sides, without an option to go up by 1 or type in a value. This is a basic that has been overlooked.   Summary:  I look forward to logging many more hours before updating this review (so far at around 30 hrs). Recommended for anyone who loves old-school (or new) cRPGs or any 1-4 group of friends looking for a great game to co-op, just note it requires much focus, dialogue/reading and chatting, so I wouldn't recommend playing with a stranger. Also be prepared for 4 hr+ play times. It is almost impossible to make any progress in 1-2 hr playings. Congrats to Larian on a job well done, it's been one of the better RPG games I have played in years.  I would score D:OS2 9/10."

wally,143,2,0,January 17,Recommended,147.0,"This game is a veritable masterpiece, and I would wager the best game I have ever played. The sheer freedom you are offered and the extreme creative solutions you can use to figure out any and every puzzle, battle or even little distractions, is alone enough to make this purchase well worth it. But Larian Studios went above and beyond fully voice acting all 75k lines of dialogue. The game offers a unique take on combat, heavily focusing on the environment around you and how to use it to your advantage in combat, constantly fighting for highground, throwing barrels, or laying down sheets of slippery ice in order to barely claw through the fight. The combat offers insane depth and even offers an arena mode in which you can duel other players with custom parties. The story experience also offers a full drop in/drop out 4-player experience. Every player is free to do what they want and at times this can lead to conflicting goals and fighting between what the party will do.   Even with all of this to offer, Larian went even further and added a GM mode, which allows users to create custom campaigns and a game master to guide the groups adventure. This also comes with full steam workshop support, allowing you to mod the game as you wish.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is, I think, the best game ever created and I suggest that you purchase this work of art as soon as you are able."

Captain K'nuckles,449,2,0,"September 2, 2017",Recommended,68.6,"Every once in a while, I get this unscratchable itch to play an RPG that allows for the freedom to not only get lost in the world and lore set before me, but to also interact and complete quests in a very open ended manner, create really unique characters with their own unique stories and ideals, and even have an actual sense of tabletop-esq role play while playing both solo and multiplayer. I've always wanted to be able to (for example) choose between either fighting a group of guards, stealth and skullduggery to sneak my way in, cause a major distraction and simply walk in, or whatever else possibility is necessary to achieve my goals of breaking into the captian's office to obtain incriminating documents.  Then along comes Divinity: Original Sin 2. A massive step up from D:OS1, (An already legendary CRPG) in just about every single major category. This EA is a very old build of what the final game will be if you've been keeping up with the Larian Dev Vids on YouTube and it still doesn't fail to astound me and scratch that itch.  We still have GM Mode to look forward to, and full mod support, and the fully unlocked campaign!   TLDR;  10/10"

Allanon,58,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,305.7,"I spent 99% of the time dicking around exploring the map.  In many other games I wouldn't have had a great time doing that because the map would end or there wouldn't be anything particularly interesting to find.  In say, Skyrim, there would probably be a cave with generic enemies to kill and that would be all.  In this game though, there was always something utterly magical to find.  I helped a rat and a turtle living in a cellar find love.  I talked to and killed evil scarecrows and helped a succubus escape a twisted hellscape with her lover.  I broke into the cellar of a kindly old woman who offered me a loan after her cat told me there were suspicious types down there and found debt collectors who turned into demons when approached.  Yet the most magical thing of all is how natural and meaningful it felt.  As a I naturally progressed through the game's story, I ran into so many bits that rewarded this idle and almost obsessive exploration.  Indeed, the story is so wonderfully open ended at times giving such simple yet broad goals that the only correct thing you can do at times is explore and lose yourself in this magical world that Larian has made.    Despite the broad nature of most of your goals the story still manages to remain present and intelligent.  Oftentimes it will surprise you by popping up at the most unexpected moments with new twists and turns in the most natural of fashions leading up to a conclusion that is both epic and satisfying.  At the beginning, your goal is simple: escape Fort Joy.  The game gives you little to no guidance on how you might do that yet you'll never feel at a lost since you'll discover so many possible ways to escape just by naturally exploring your environment.    This is easily the best game I have ever played.  There is so much magic, so much attention to detail, and a utterly brilliant and punishing battle system to boot.  It will be a long, long time before a game ever comes close to how good this game is."
Zely,93,2,0,"November 22, 2017",Recommended,371.8,I usually only stick to MMORPGs but I didn't regret this purchase for a second. The only RPG where I felt like I made choices (besides picking a class) that actually impacted the game.
Kiksu,287,2,0,"November 27, 2017",Recommended,105.5,"I took a bit of a punt on this game. I hadn‚Äôt played the original and I‚Äôve never really had much of an interest in Baldur‚Äôs Gate style RPGs. But a couple of friends were really enjoying it and I was suffering from PUBG fatigue so I went ahead and bought it a few weeks after its release.  I‚Äôm really glad I did!  The first thing I liked was that it doesn‚Äôt require you to have played the first game to understand what is going on. It doesn‚Äôt assume knowledge of characters, events or setting. Everything comes at you in the context of the world you are in.  The RPG elements are easy to get to grips with. There are a massive number of skills to learn and I found that my party almost organically grew into distinct classes. I ended up with a warrior, a ranger, a wizard and an assassin. But I never felt like I was limited to a class because of the choices I‚Äôd made. I started to give my warrior some magical skills mid-way through my current playthrough and it works. Weapon and armour stats are simple too. The bigger the numbers, the better the item. I like that simplicity. That's not to say there is no depth.  You'll often need to compromise between armours physical strength defence and magical strength defence for example.  And a weapon may give you buffs and skills that the high level shiny sword you've just looted does not.  The world is massive. At the time of writing I‚Äôve put in about 80 hours and I think I‚Äôm a little over half way through the game. At times the game can be a little intimidating. On arriving in a new area you can find yourself picking up quest after quest after quest. That many of these quests are not signposted on your map means you‚Äôre going to have to read the description to figure out where to go and what to do. I have quite a short attention span and so having to force myself to pay attention to the details and to keep referring to my log book was an interesting challenge that, somewhat surprisingly, I found I liked a lot.  The turn based combat reminds me a lot of the first two Fallout games, right down to the number of moves you can make being displayed as circular ‚Äòpips‚Äô. Fights are genuinely thrilling encounters where tactics will play a huge part in your winning (or losing) a battle. High ground confers a damage bonus.  Different spells will interact with one another to produce (often unwanted) side effects. I‚Äôve found myself having to sacrifice party members in a fight for a strategic advantage. The same fight might play out in different ways depending on how you approach it. Some fights can be avoided altogether if you‚Äôre a quick talker!  The biggest problem I have with the game is almost a contradiction of what I like about the game. It encourages you to explore. Very little is laid out for you. You need to learn the games mechanics and your path through its world yourself. Your choices are not restrictive. However, I did get to a point, early on, where it felt like I was being constrained to a certain path through the world because so many of the combat situations I was getting into were unwinnable. A couple of turns against the AI and I was dead. This was slightly frustrating as it meant a good deal of trial and error and quite a bit of backtracking. Ultimately it felt like a waste of time. But the counter argument is that it falls in line with the games mechanics. It does not lead you from one point to the next. You have to figure stuff out for yourself.  So yes, I‚Äôm very happy I picked this up and would absolutely recommend it, certainly from the position of someone who is perhaps typically more into action games than RPGs.  I‚Äôll definitely be picking up the original Divinity once I finally finish this game."
Prykie1995,235,2,0,"December 16, 2017",Recommended,141.8,"Can't sing this game's praises high enough. I begrudgingly bought it, largely out of principle, having heard of it being brilliant and that it was independently developed and published, thinking that I might not like it or give up on it. But I didn't, and now i'm here telling you to buy it.  I started the game up and thought it felt too slow, too cumbersome and somewhat bloated, with just the first area taking near enough half an hour to an hour to fully explore and understand what's going on. It got even worse when I got to the next area. ""god this drags on"" I was thinking, ""when's the proper fighting and loot fest stuff gonna happen?"" I thought. In hindsight, I definitely didn't understand the pace of the game and the focus of it at all. After having put in over 50 hours I can now say that this game, for what i've played, is a masterpiece.   It shares similarities with games like diablo or torchlight, but with mechanics and design choices that make you consider every little move you make, this game manages to scratch at more and more layers of depth and forces you to explore options you wouldn't otherwise if not for the firm but fair difficulty. The AI is clever. It doesnt just bash at you with anything/everything, it picks and chooses what it needs to do to take you down. It picks off the weak, avoids the strong and weakens the immovable by using the environment and the creatures therein to it's advantage. For instance, there is a skill in the game that let's you kill an enemy if your character dies. Having cast this, the enemy's allies, themselves unaffected by this skill, will avoid killing your character but WILL proceed to weaken and immobilise you so that when it wears off they can take you down. They work things like this out and have clear strategic formations you need to counter.  It's one of the most rewarding experiences: coming into a fight fully unprepared, as the underdog, only to walk out the other side the victor. You know it was because YOU made the critical choices needed to win that battle against the odds and against a genuinely THINKING cpu opponent. It's fantastic.  The way the game feels to play when you're fully invested is unparralleled. There is an absolute deluge of content if you seek to complete it all and the way the game gives you utter freedom to do whatever you want/need/can do is both daunting and refreshing at the same time. The difficulty is fine tuned to perfection, where small mistakes can be cleverly worked around but rushing can easily get you killed.   Take your time, learn the ropes and think about each and every move as if it's your last, that's when the game is at it's best.    BUY IT"

Avascar,117,2,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,209.2,"What's makes an RPG? This game exceeds almost all of my expecations, and wipes away all of my fears. Engrossing writing, lovable characters, engaging combat, challenging choices, great soundtrack, and CO-OP. It's hard for me to not love this game in every aspect. And surely, it's a game that's difficult to top. Do note I will mostly talk about the main campaign, because it's what I put the most hours into.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a video game designed to look into your very soul, and asks a very direct question, 'Who are you?'. You can make a custom character, or one of the six origin characters (with specific dialogue, unique quests, and a generally different experience), and take part in an adventure alone, with NPC companions (with their own personality and relationship with you), or actual players. It goes back to the roots of RPG's, and gives you ultimate freedom to do and be whoever you want to be. To be whatever or whoever you want. And your choices matter, for every kill and every choice changes the world in some way. The world is real. You're in an adventure.  From the voice acted merchants, to the bustling cities and towns, you'll manage to find every nook and cranny as this game is filled with secrets only meant for the die-hard explorers. Different dialogue choices, hidden quests, OP loot, completely different outcomes; the world reacts to how you behave and what you know. Whether you decide to become the traditionalist hero, to the megalomaniac villian. The choice is ultimately up to you, and the game respects that. No choice nor fight is as black and white as they seem, as everyone in the story is both good and bad in their own rights (probably with the exception of the source king). It's a game you can't really have a ""perfect run"" on, choices will grant many different and branching choices based on what you do.  It goes back to the roots of RPGs from the days of Dungeons & Dragons, takes the modernism of current RPGs, and dosed with the whimsical love from Larian into a game that twists you as a whole, showing your true colors. In Co-op, it tests your relationships with your friends, as you must know only one out of the four adventurers can be Divine. It's a game that's both cooperative and yet slightly competitive, and it adds great storytelling to the entire experience.  Not only does the game contain loads of different dialogue, secrets, choices, and outcomes, it has some of the most revolutionary turn-based combat I've seen. Environmental effects from fire, rain, poison, and water. You can spend hours strategizing with your friends setting up the battlefields, as almost every enemy have their own weaknesses and strengths you must overcome. Each fight is interesting to their core, making you adapt to each situation in geography, location, environment, skills, and enemy types.  I only recently completed this game, and I realize it's one of those few games I'll have really fond moments of. It's a game where as soon as you beat it, you'll immediately start another run. I wouldn't mind paying for expansions, because the level of quality that Larian provides is amazingly superb. I don't want to give many spoilers to the game, it is full of many surprises that you must experience yourself. It's unforgettable, I tell you!  Of course, this game isn't perfect. Bugs are rather prevalent, as you literally can't get some achievements. Aside from bugs, I do wish there was more character development between my companions. This isn't an issue when all of your characters are actual people. But when they're NPC companions they don't talk very often, only during specific and important story scenes. If you play solo, there will be times when you don't notice their presence because they never have any dialogue to say, which is a shame in my opinion. I won't dabble on it much, but Act 4 is a bit lame as there isn't as much depth to it compared to Act 1 and 2. This entry of the series also messes up the timeline of the games, which puzzles many previous players like me. And the final boss isn't as magnificant as I wanted it to be (no multiple boss phases!?!).  There's also the Arena mode, which is an online PvP game mode. It's pretty dead, and it seems to be the most rushed out of the 3 (Campaign, Arena, and Game Master). You can only select a few presets of characters (no character nor skill customization), and in my experience I had trouble finding a match to play. I wouldn't play this for the Arena mode because it's pretty awful. The idea is great, but the execution just isn't there.  I also haven't managed to play much of the Game Master mode. A game mode that's quite literally Dungeons and Dragons. There's a rather small following for it, and there are custom campaigns out you can play right now. And from the looks of it, seems very fun. The combat is very streamlined, and the numbers are very easy to manage. I find it better than the use of spreadsheets, very long text documents, or literally piles of papers in my experience. But ultimately, it's personal preference.  But aside from that, everything about this game is fantastic. OST (Main theme, Rivellon, all the character theme songs), aesthetics (perhaps the humans and dwarves are a bit ugly looking), storytelling, dialogue, choices, secrets, combat, mod support, and so much more. Don't think my critiques give you the impression that they ruin the entire experience, because they don't. In the end, you'll feel like you finished an adventure. You mold the game, and yet the game molds you. The world of Rivellon reacts to your moves, with its inner gears shifting and moving. You will tell countless stories of it, I assure you.  So, what makes an RPG? The storytelling experience. And a storytelling experience that allows you to be in the eyes of a child, becoming whoever or whatever you want and having your choices matter in a significant way is an astonishing feat all on its own.  And that, is why I would easily give this game a 10/10. Simply revolutionary."

If you're a fan of cRPG's in any sense (think Baulder's Gate) you will absolutely love this.   The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, the graphics are great, the gameplay is where it REALLY shines. The fights are difficult, the AI is actually smart, and tactician will put your characters through a grinder when you thought you had it down.  At no point in the game did I feel like it was a slog or a chore to get through during my first playthrough, there was always something meaningful I could do. Just one more side quest before the main story, helping out this one person, talking to this one chicken. The story is also very well done, I feel as though I could actually talk to the characters if they were real people, they are fleshed out very well.   Larian is an extremely awesome company, they delayed the release of the game to add in a fully voiced game due to community request. They listen to their customers, apply the feedback properly, and keep them updated. Definitely the best game company out there right now.  The first act is a very good tutorial, the second act builds the world and the story, and act 3 and 4 take the fun of those two and multiply it by 5. I don't have enough good things to say about this game. The only negative is that it has now ruined so many others for me, because they won't be as good as this.

To keep it simple, here's what the original game done so well that was fantastic  - Fantastic Turn-Based Tactical Combat - Compelling Narrative  - No Handholding Approach to World Design - Challenging Encounters  - Beautiful Hand-Crafted World  The sequel improves on the above in pretty much every way but tweaks the formula  - 4 races to pick between and a 5th to come soon - Smarter AI, you can no longer butcher and steal while NPC's lick windows - Better pacing - Combat feels better all round, movement is punished less, animations feel tighter and the armour mechanic means you get CC cheesed a lot less  All round despite being an Alpha it's incredibly playable and I've noticed only minor bugs.

If you dont like this genre or the lore/style I would ask to reconsider.  Try Path of Exile which is free and if you're have the least amount of fun on that game that means you will have 1000x fun in this one.  So many game modes and possibilities this game shows great promise and at a tremendous quality.  10/10.

theflightless,15,2,1,April 13,Recommended,244.8,"Great. Thoughtful combat/character development leads to tremendous satisfaction in the short/long terms. The best game I've ever played, beating out Divinity: Original Sin by several hairs.   The combat is phenomenal - would love to see a whole plethora of games with similar mechanics, if they could be similarly deep and balanced.  Similar but better than the turn-based gridded games I know - Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy tactics, Advance Wars. These were rough, alpha attempts that were not inspired enough to thresh out the real strategic possiblilities of turn-based gaming, to great depth.   Also just feels good - taking control of and building your characters in this game is particularly rewarding. You know and love them, and become intimately familiar with their capabilities even as throughout they grow in fits and spurts into more powerful, novel, and complicatedly effective beings. Integrating new abilities, talents, and stat proclivities into them is a meaningful test of your tactical control. Choosing those is a test of your strategic wisdom."

ColdWolf,"1,027",2,0,"May 26, 2017",Recommended,238.9,"The single most detailed, challenging and fun cRPG I've ever played. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is not only a deep and meaningful game of tactics, exploration and puzzle solving, but also a master-class in dialogue and writing that shames Original Sin as if it were the work of a child in comparison.  Quests with meaningful choices and justifications, thought-out and deep skill combos that affect your playstyle and experience in combat, a surprisingly intriguing and not at all by-the-numbers story and absolutely NO handholding.  Everything that is great and wonderful about character driven RPGs is here and fleshed out,  I believe I've finally found the game that will let me retire from reinstalling Neverwinter Nights again for good. The only thing I wish they had done is let you roam the entire world like in Original Sin; the chapters are separate areas. They provide ample warning before you leave an area though, so it's not like it's a frustrating mechanic!  There have been complaints about the difficulty of not only the combat but also in solving the puzzles; If you're struggling to solve a puzzle it's because you haven't found all the clues; they're always there somewhere. if you can't beat a particular enemy because he's too strong you're gonna have to come back to him later. The game won't coddle you, you're supposed to learn how to defeat different enemy combinations through hard work and experimentation! The game is equal parts merciless and forgiving, enlightening and mystifying, challenging and fun.   A must-buy, and above all else; we must have a sequel, Larian!  The holiday is over, get back to work developer slaves!"

Dais Spires,41,2,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,51.8,"I love this game. I played the first one for a long time so I was already a fan, but this one is better then the first by far. I love the new class skills, the new races, and simplified crafting system. The game is appropriately difficult, and you will most likely have to do some battles more then once to figure it out. So save often. Build craft is so much fun in the game, and the replay value is very clear from the start. I keep wanting to make new characters just to try things differently. I love Love LOVE playing a Rouge. Teleporting, sneaking, stealing and back-stabbing. It's just the best.   The multiplayer in this game is a lot of fun too. I play with my husband for hours on our days off. We yell at eachother from other rooms to try and figure out a strategy, or when one of use screws up and kills the other. I feel like you wanna play this with someone you really like though, because the first time they accidentally stun you, and ruin your big attack you've been setting up, you'll wanna kill them. I am very glad this game is Co-op though. We need more games like this in the world.   So, get this game. You already want to, or else you wouldn't be here. Just do it. You won't regret it, and if you do, then there is something wrong with you. This game is amazing."

Draceon,77,2,0,February 16,Recommended,22.3,"Story For those who love games like Skyrim, The Witcher, and Dragon Age, this game will be a welcome addition to your arsenal. It possesses background and history which I might in some cases call even better than any of the aforementioned games. Though much is left open to interpretation, the game does provide the player with a handfull of hints. and information. Its not so much that the story is more developed, after all Skyrim, The Witcher, and Dragon Age all have plenty of lore associated with them. However, Divinity has a better way of enticing the player to want to know more. The game isn't simply about finishing the main storyline, its more about the exploration of the world along the way. Your team will have certain skillsets, including a skill called loremaster which allows the player to learn about ancient, newly discovered artifacts. Each race has their own history and the relations between the races continue to devlop and become more known throughout the game. The game feels linear without feeling as though it limits the player, and I find this to be a great thing.  Controls and Perspective One ting that deterred me from playing more of this game earlier was the strange third person perspective, I am not personally used to this top down way of playing and pathfinding issues were sometimes a problem, though they were almost always solvable. It doesn't seem as engaging without the first person view, and in some ways seems more like a MOBA such as League of Legends in the way that the player sees the game. However, the game does allow the player to zoom in to see quite a lot more detail in the character models and the surroundings. It also uses some interesting post processing techniques to blur the backgrounds and have characters stand out when zooming in. However, its easy to get used to andn though perhaps not as immersive as Skyrim and The Witcher, it certainly has its benefits, particularly as pertaining to the combat system, which I will come to later.   Character Creation and Teams There are four races that can be played in the game, each have their skeletal variants which are also playable, these 4 species are dwarves, elves, humans, and lizards. Lizards are my personal favorite, I find them to look quite cool. However, who you pick and how you build them is completely up to you. Your decisions to upgrade certain skills, the race you choose, and the ability you decidie to learn all influence how the game progresses. Lorewise, Lizards are nobles and are often disliked because of their snobbish nature. Elves can eat flesh and learn about what that person was last doing, dwarves seem to be rather talkative, and humans are, well, boring. Because they're human. But while who you choose to play matters, you can still adopt team members from various different races and backgrounds and get their benefits. They can have all manner of classes and specializations. You can be a necromancer, reanimating the dead and using them for your advantage, sucking the life out of your enemies. You can cast air or fire spells to destroy your enemies. Or you can hit people with swords and arrows, definitely not as epic, but still quite important.  Combat System This combat system is one of the most unique, but challenging ones I've seen in a while. I thought turn based had to mean something along the lines of Civ V, but it really doesn't. Turn based combat really adds strategy to this game, you have to position your mages, rangers, assassins, and fighters correctly in order to be able to deal the most damage and keep your team alive. With such a diverse amount of spells and weapons, everything brings something new to the table. There is no undo button and making the wrong choices can lead to costly issues. However, a teammate dieing does not necessarily mean they are dead forever, a resurrection scroll can bring them back to life without too many issues. However, they do take some materials to craft or a lot of money to create.  Choices Matter Each dialogue, every upgrade, every step in combat seems to matter. When a player is given a choice, it is usually important for some reason. Thats part of what I love about this game so much, everything I do can lead to a different outcome. No game gives the player so many possibilities while still holding true to a definite storyline. However, your choices in skills start to matter less in the second act where you can just change your appearance and reallocate skill points. I like being able to change your appearance, but I don't think that reallocating skill points is the best idea. Though I have used it plenty, I feel like it takes away from some of the gravity that your choices have. It does however provide more freedom to change and evolve, which I can't argue with.  Crafting and Trading Yes, this game has crafting, and I'm not quite sure it was a good idea. One issue with this game in particular is that enemies don't respawn, so once you have cleared a camp and killed some enemies, they will never come back. You are essentially done with that zone. And this wouldn't be a problem considering how long it takes to finish the game and that there are so many places to visit, but it doesn't truly favor crafting. Though crafting is a good addition to almost any game, I don't find myself using it that much, the one time I have used it was for a quest. Considering how many items I get all the time from loot, it also doesn't really seem necessary to be crafting in this game. Would there be more opportunity to settle down and if this were more like a sandbox game, then the crafting system would make a lot more sense. I'm not saying this game shouldn't have one, I'm just saying that it doesn't really add to the experience like everything else does. When traidng with NPCs, you often get far less than an item is worth and the items you buy can cost 6-8 times as much. I know a lot of games charge these ridiculous in game prices with the in game currency and you can decrease cost with a skill, but I find this a bit excessive.   The Best Skill No doubt, the best skill is being able to talk with animals. It opens up new quests and oppprtunities, get it on at least one character, its called pet pal. I feel like this should come equipped by default with the main character as it is really important.  Summary All in all this is an absolutely wondeful game, with amazing graphics and intense storyline and lore. You're getting a fully fledged RPG on the level of other triple AAA titles. The player truly gets a sense of freedom whilst still being casually pushed in a direction. Each choice matters, each choice changes an outcome, and everything depends on the players playstyle and preference. Nothing in the story seems out of place, everything fits together, and the only limit to playing through this game is the willingness of those who wish to look deeper into the story. If you like a good/solid rpg game that isn't the standard shooter or hack and slash, then this is a game for you!"

SuicideKing,107,2,0,January 22,Recommended,177.9,"At the risk of heaping too much praise on the game despite not even having left the initial Fort Joy area, it's bloody marvellous.  There are so many paths to take in the story and each NPC interaction feels unique. I'm playing 2 mutliplayer games in parallel, with different characters, and it's played out differently in both cases because of different starting variables and events, along with different player actions. It's really great. BTW, it's not like we haven't escaped Fort Joy because we don't know how to - oh no, we could have escaped at multiple moment, but we chose to stay. Partly to XP farm, partly because there's just so much to do!  Moreover, it addresses the issue i usually have with games that have level systems and loot - the weapons scale with your attributes, and higher level gear can be equipped if you have the appropriate attributes. So for example, if you're playing a melee build and have the appropriate Strength, you can equip level 4 armour while being level 3.  Combat is pretty fun if you're into turn-based stuff. Think ""new XCOM but with Action Points"", but perhaps more chaotic and varied. Spread some oil, set it ablaze. Then chuck poison in it to watch it go boom! Or the other way around.There are pre-defined classes but you can tweak them as you like, and respec any time. I haven't even got to the point where I can use Source abilities yet.  Crafting seems pretty complex, but it's really cool. Find a stick, some rope and a knife - you now have a knife-on-a-stick and can use it as a sword. Find a stick and a large sea shell, you now have a magic staff. Have a potion flask and a poison barrel? Well, now you have a poison flask. Why'd you need a poison flask? Because Undead heal with poison (and get damaged by health/vitality potions).  Anyway, it's an exceptionally well made game. Runs pretty smooth for me at pretty high settings (can't remember, i think it just set itself to ultra, and i didn't have to tamper with the settings) @ 1080p with a i5-3570K, GTX 670 and 8GB of RAM. Haven't encountered any bugs yet. Let that sink in. A game bought 3 months after release, in 2017, has not had a single bug so far, in 20 hours of play.

Snardbuckett,227,2,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,626.6,"At first i was quite apprehensive, i played the game at a friends house in beta and i did not like the direction the game was going at first. The original armor system was akin to mass effect 2 and it felt very rock paper scissors like .... Thanksfully shy of release they made a drastic change in how armor works and he new system is quite refreshing and i like it.  the addition of a band of characters who are not blank slates while still being customizable for how you mechnically want to play the game was freaking brilliant. I love specifically Fane and Lfan the most but all of the characters are this fantastic dichotomy of being terrible people yet relatable people that seem like thier actions are primarily tainted by being on the wrong side of a ""very bad day"".  i think they did  aslightly better job of making it somewhat apparent where and what you needed to do from the get go and the ""tutorial"" section on the ship is great, playing throught the turtorial is drastically better than a pile of exposition to tell you how to play an RPG from the ground up.  Im not 100% sold on the new skill system as better, but it certainly is fluid and doent punish you as harshly for side speccing, i also like that crafting does not require skill investment and that the ""Civil"" skills have been split off so you dont have to try to choose between skewering harder or not sounding like a neanderthal in conversation.  I do however wish crafting seemed more impactful at low levels .... custom crafting your weapons and getting ahead of the curve through exploration theft and smart trading was quite fun in OS1. i find that somewhat removed in OS2 and most crafting early game is primarily for ""consumables"" and the customization of old on your own crafted weapons seems somewhat limited (using essences to add a damage type)  the introduction of more playable character races is a welcome change and the tag system really amps up the replayability to 11. I definitely agree with the sentiment its one of the best game sof the year quite possibly the best yet."

Combat is in depth, but I will update my review upon delving fully into the combat system.  It is out of all the games I've purchased recently, the most rewarding for the money I spent in time and enjoyment its given me, and I'm not even finished with the game. Far from it.  If you enjoyed Fallout, Fallout 2, The Elder Scrolls series, and other deep RPG's that modern RPG's have moved away from, with all the polish and modern tech of a triple A game, definitely give Divinity 2: Original Sin a go.

But as soon as I wake up, I find that all my stuff is stolen. There's 5 guys in my room that I don't know. Suprised I ask the lizard lady what's going on, she says she's sorry, but this is a setup.  I get angry, you can't fool me, you can't set me up! Naked and without any weapons I attack the robbers, and I kill them all, taking the weapons of their body to finish of the rest, and using my magic to dish out even more damage. In the end, they all drop dead and I'm victorious. I talk to the lizard lady to ask what just happened, she admits they tried to rob me. The smooth-talker I am decide to forgive her, and say it was worth it for the night I had. She liked what I said, I continue talking to her, we end up having another sexy night.

Marirow,457,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,44.6," I'd recommend this game if you're a fan of tactical games like XCOM or Fire Emblem, or if you like story-heavy games.  The combat is the strongest part of the game, but it's also the hardest to get into; I had to restart the game multiple times to get the right party structure to tackle the game's challenges.  Adaptability and crowd control are key in this combat system. If you don't have the right party makeup, skills, and items, then it's going to feel like the game is cheating you. Enemies will constantly be inflicting status conditions (usually turn-skipping ones) if your armor isn't up to snuff. A lack of skills means that enemies will be able to out-maneuver and out-damage you. And, of course, having a party of all mages isn't a good idea when archers can just sit and take potshots at you three times a turn. If you're not sure what you're doing, there's no shame in playing on the lower difficulty setting. Trust me.  The other two major selling points of this game are the story and the exploration, both of which are a bit weaker in terms of originality but are just as great as the combat system. The dialogue is your standard Neverwinter Nights affair, made a bit spicier by the Tags system. Simply put, each character has Tags (related to aspects of their personality, history, or appearance) that give unique dialogue options. You can even acquire new tags as you play, making the system versatile as well. The dialogue itself is well-written and hilarious at times, giving the game a comedic twist and elevating it from a drab, boring fantasy adventure. I won't spoil the story, but I'll say that after 30 hours I've only brushed up against what the story has to offer. The thousands upon thousands of dialogue trees are backed up by some impressive voice acting, which makes reading through the game's story (which might as well be novel length, if not longer) actually fun and engaging instead of a slog.  The exploration, then. This is probably the weakest part of the game-- not  bad,  just  weaker.  The world is enormous and full of sidequests, characters, and miniature adventures to go on, which really scratched my explorative itch. However, I often felt that the game wasn't using its exploration elements as well as it could. Quests can only really reward you with money and gear; money always gets hoovered by buying new, better gear from shopkeepers, and gear almost always becomes obsolete as soon as your characters level up. I found myself picking up really cool, unique gear, only for it to be  immediately  replaced by something slightly better. This is on top of a loot system that leaves your inventory constantly cluttered with random garbage, and forces you to check every single empty crate just in case there's a scroll of resurrection inside. I swear, Rivellon has an epidemic of empty crates.  In short, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a  very good game.  My biggest complaints are with the little things. The combat is just a little to obtuse, the exploration is just a little too unimportant, etc. The good things far, far outweigh the bad. If you're a fan of CRPGs, like games that focus on the story, or enjoy tactical combat, this game is an excellent buy."

THIS GAME IS FOR YOU.  I haven't completed the game yet, but from what I have seen it is definitely my new favorite game of all time. The amount of fun that I have with this game reminds me of when I first picked up Dragon Age Origins. You can create any type of character you want and even change it later if you aren't happen with your choices. The game doesn't really hold your hand, which is nice, and there are many ways to strategize a battle -- use your imagination! If you have a character that is sneaking around you can initiate combat with your other characters and have that sneaky character get into position before engaging.   The crafty is really tricky in the sense that it doesn't really help you. You can pick up books that give you recipes, but if you don't find any books you wont know how to make certain things. There are guides online to help in this regard, however. The amount of things you can craft is seemingly endless. Dozens of spells are craft only spells!  Try a playthrough by yourself to get your bearings, or jump into a game with a guide and have them show you the ropes. The game is best with friends, but it still enjoyable by yourself.  There are bugs, but it is to be expected. Updates are quick and the developer actually listens to the players.  8.5/10"

I've picked it up and can't put it back down; a experience I haven't had in years, especially when the game market is full of cheap cop outs. The base game has tons of hours of content, and gives you everything you need to make your own stories-- that is, the gamemaster mode is comprehensive and amazing.  If I had to make a comparison... I'd say it's like Coop skyrim but with much more depth and content. In any case, I strongly recommend this game, especially if you have a group of friends you like to play with regularly."

It's really that great if you into RPG stuff. If you not it's the best place to start. If you have friends who would like to play it with you, it will be your GOTY, for sure.  Pros: Great graphics. One of the best fantasy soundtracks in gaming history. Great campaign with funny, intense moments, scary and entertaining moments. Great writing and overall plot. Huge replayability. Awesome tactical combats. Complex and flexible character building. The best implementation of the coop gameplay in all RPGs ever. Game Master mode for those who would like to play with their friends even after the campaign. A great mod tool that allows you do almost anything in the game. If you willing to spend some time off cause. Content in the game for 100+ hours minimum. Arena PVP mode exists.  Cons: The game still has some bugs. Though all great RPGs has and developers are working really hard fixing them. GM mode could have more love. It lacks a lot of crucial features and a lot of things that exist in the game are unavailable. Though mods in the workshop can help with fixing some of them. Arena PVP mode could have even more love. It's very primitive and it seems like developers haven't worked much on it. Hope they will improve it in the future.  Should you buy it? Definitely!"

Mokona,31,2,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,22.7,"This review is just based on my first impressions of the game. Its worth getting.  There is an insane amount of skills and combos you can do that a single play through will never allow you to see all the cool stuff you can do so the replay value is high. My favorite thing I've discovered in the game is the way recruiting followers works. First you must convince them to follow you to begin with, they dont just come along because you are the ""chosen one"" or some crap. To boot if you like a character you dont have to worry about him being a mage when you are already a mage because each character asks you what you want them to be. No longer are you forced to not take your favorite npc with you or forced to play a class you dont like just to take it with you. You can finally have a balanced party full of npc you find interesting hurrah.  The only thing I would ""complain"" about is the lack of non human races. You got human, dwarf (small human), elf (vegetarian human), and lizard man (finally its not a human). Skeleton variations of all is nice to throw in but I honestly am just done with every fantacy game haveing there races be the 3 over used races, human, elf, dwarf, and then a final race being there own ""custom"" race that just turn out to be another human but blue or something like that. Glad we got lizard men but wish we had a few more.  This game has a lot of thought put into it and it somehow didn't lauch at the $60 price point, with mod support. I expected this to be as dissapointing as pillars of eternity was but just jumping into the character creation and I was already loving the game."

Imagine D&D with one of the best story-telling and smart dungeon masters, and that is the feel of this game. Combat is incredibly in depth and tactical, hard modes require grinding and ingenuity. Sound design, voice work, character designs, class systems are all next level. If you're looking for constant action this might not be the game for you, but if you want to be absorbed into a world, experience an incredibly rewarding feeling when finally beating a fight, and spend hours exploring and shooting off on side quests this is the game for you.

If you're a fan of cRPG's in any sense (think Baulder's Gate) you will absolutely love this.   The soundtrack is absolutely incredible, the graphics are great, the gameplay is where it REALLY shines. The fights are difficult, the AI is actually smart, and tactician will put your characters through a grinder when you thought you had it down.  At no point in the game did I feel like it was a slog or a chore to get through during my first playthrough, there was always something meaningful I could do. Just one more side quest before the main story, helping out this one person, talking to this one chicken. The story is also very well done, I feel as though I could actually talk to the characters if they were real people, they are fleshed out very well.   Larian is an extremely awesome company, they delayed the release of the game to add in a fully voiced game due to community request. They listen to their customers, apply the feedback properly, and keep them updated. Definitely the best game company out there right now.  The first act is a very good tutorial, the second act builds the world and the story, and act 3 and 4 take the fun of those two and multiply it by 5. I don't have enough good things to say about this game. The only negative is that it has now ruined so many others for me, because they won't be as good as this. Now I'm bored and don't know what else to start playing.   Ratings: Music: 15/10 (seriously the soundtrack is THAT good) Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 9/10 Difficulty: 10/10 (has difficulties for all levels of players)  Overall it is a top 3 game that I have ever played.

Tero,108,2,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,149.5,"My party stumbles upon a hidden mound in a grave yard. None of them have a shovel so the lizard in my party (a prince) is relegated to uncover the grave with his claws. A disembodied lizard leg appears and my prince is given two options, ""Pick up"" and ""Eat."" Naturally I choose ""Eat."" A spirit appears and says ""You Savage! I hope you choke on me!"" giving my lizard prince a curse. I couldn't stop laughing...  There is a lot of humor in this game that is on purpose and a ton that is seemingly accidental. The writing is great and the stories are enthralling. I find myself wanting to complete side quests to find out what happens rather than simply squeezing that last bit of XP. Half the time I walk around after a quest is already completed just to see if there are any additional clues as to why somebody did something.  So far I am really enjoying this game.  =============== Downsides: - There are a lot of bugs. I have found a lot of situations where I have to reload the game. For example; a battle where I can't loot a corpse (the arachnid in the graveyard).  - More bugs. I discovered that the reason I couldn't target enemies in the Driftwood arena was because I wan't zoomed in enough. After I realized this I was able to beat the competition.  - Even more bugs (getting access to a waypoint early because I was on a cliff overlooking it, which allowed me to fast-travel to the waypoint and expedite my storyline). In the end it wasn't a big deal but my quest progress leap-frogged past the initial quest giver ( I met the quest giver long after I defeated the boss)."

There is so much to do in this game, every location has secrets, every NPC can be interacted with (and is voice acted, spectacularly I might add) even animals can be talked to with a certain ability, every quest is written masterfully, and the combat is what all turn based games should strive to be.  I only have 2 complaints, the first is about performance. This game stutters a lot while not being the most graphically impressing and takes up a lot of RAM use. Load times are fairly long and sometimes the sound cuts out for up to 30 seconds.  The second is about multiplayer. It's unplayable for me, after a while it's impossible to connect to an old save, the only way to play is start a new save everytime.  Other than that the game is fantastic, just wish they fixed these issues."

You dont need to have played D:OS1 to enjoy this game. Players of D:OS1 will have some easter eggs. Lighthearted and dark at the same time.  Voiced narrator and characters (every RPG needs one, once you go voiced you cant go back to reading blocks of texts)  Con: Some bugs and performance issues. some sadness at the end (the kind that you get after finishing a really good book with no immediate sequels)  This is one of those games that by the time the credits roll, you want to give the devs a standing ovation.  P.S: if you want front row seats to the main story use Fane as your main character.  If you want an amazing/rich and personal story, pick Lohse. If you want a revenge/redemption tale, pick Ifan/Sebille/Beast If you want to experience a disgraced noble's rise to power pick The red prince.   "

Sure one might actually have to read a few things, but if you like some elements of old RPG games with todays world of graphics, this is an awesome game.  The choices are well thought through, with many options available based on who is simply talking.  It is not a click anywhere type of choice, as you don't get to go back and chose the right path after failing the 3 bad choices.  In that regard the game pace is slowed down. Battles take time to rethink and strategize.   Sometimes you just are not ready, and you need to find better equipment.  The combat systems is pretty much about putting out more damage than the other team can heal and deliver back.  If you ventured into a higher level, there is a good chance you will simly die.  That challange makes it hard to figure out, if you have not found the right strategy or if you need to wait.  Great game.  Well done.

There is so much to say about the game even in the small amount I've played, but the long and the short of it is that the sheer amount of choice it gives you is incredible. Already between my two campaigns I've seen large changes between interactions with characters, different quests, and different class combos. I'm very excited to see everything this game has to offer.  And as a final point, I can't believe that this is an Indie game. In my opinion, this is as entertaining as almost any triple A I've played in the last fair while.

Ihnspyre,193,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,23.3,"This is a cRPG done right:  -  awesome graphics -  fantastic combat and background mechanics -  a lot of freedom -  nice voice acting -  very nice soundtrack  The game is a must buy, Larian did almost everything right in the production department, they listened to critics from the first game, they responded positively to suggestions from fans and worked a lot to improve their game.   This game is exactly that, a very WELL MADE cRPG BUT it lacks a few things that some cRPG fans love about the genre.   Firstly, nothing you see in this game is especially interesting from an artistic point of view. The maps are quite big and full of quests and things to do but there aren't too many WAH moments where you can just admire the artistic design of the map. They are mostly FUNCTIONAL and full of content but uninteresting. While games like Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity have awesome dungeon designs, awesome towns (Twin Elms etc.) and fantastic visual landscapes, D:OS 2 has classic maps with meh design and a lot of secrets.   Most of the game has a lighthearted style of writing, classic personalities for characters, kind of boring lore and story. There aren't too many memorable moments throughout the game (I got very close to the end of the game before getting bored of it on another shared account, bought it for Larian deserved support and future updates + multiplayer) and it really does nothing special except for the combat and mechanics (which are great!). The thing is that we are used to cRPGs full of bugs or questionable developer attitude and when an RPG like D:OS 2 comes out, without a lot of bugs, with a lot of content and fantastic gameplay, well, we tend to overrate it.   The humour was okay, not good and not bad. The party dynamics is not as good as Pillars of Eternity and that cRPG is more suitable for my taste (with complex lore and story, a lot of party interaction, fantastic artistic design and soundtrack).   Overall, Larian deserve a lot of support for being awesome hardworking devs but not for imagination, originality or artistic skills."

Best when playing with another player (up to 3 additional players). Tons of lore, story, and ways to deal with most situations. Lots of freedom in how you want to play the game.   Downside is that combat isn't as frequent and leveling does tend to be on the slower side. You'll spend more time gearing up or chatting than doing anything else. Enemies, in general, are on the weaker side, so sometimes combat doesn't feel as rewarding.   Fun moments: -Trying to break into the ship's kitchen ends with the entire ship blowing up. -Battling asssassins in one motel room, while listening to npcs in another room talk about their love life.  -The moment my cousin and I realize the food we've been eating was made of the local law enforcement that continues to go missing.  -The moment my cousin and I realize what the gods were planning leading to a an epic betrayal of all betrayals.  -Failing to save a family from an execution leading to all out war in the oil fields.  -Realizing the badguys at the end had a very reasonable endgame to their scheme that would have led to the best kind of ending you could get in the game.  -Having my cousin backstab me as I attempt to take Divinity for myself (I won't forget this cuz.

In this game all those minor/big issues I had with the series is gone.  One of my favorite things about this game is all the dialog options and more are available depending on your race, and tags. The random things you can do and play with your own style to pass are just amazing and leave me with a complete immersive feeling at all times. I'm still in the tutorial zone at nearly 9 hours because im taking it nice and slow while reading all that dialog. A somewhat early review but I've already noticed ALL my nitpicks from the first game have been addressed in this game.  Major improvements that I love from the last game: + More Dialog choices + Recruiting any new member gives you the choice to select their class allowing for a party of your choice as well + Selling an item worth a lot of money gives you quick reputation with traders + Killing someone in town away from everyone doesn't make the entire world hate you in this game + New Classes/Undead! + Very informative tutorial + New armor/movement/combat system that feels perfected for turn based + Inventory enhancements making it really easy to deal with all party members quickly + Co-op + 4 Players + Crafting"
Lobster Dominance Hierarchy,30,2,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,364.3,"Great game! The Larian team has done it again. I'm happy for them, especially considering the studios history when they were taken advantage of in the past. I particularly like the shout outs and throwbacks to the DOS1, and I'm no where near done the game yet. If you are wanting a role playing strategy game where you actually interact with your companions, and who have their own motives/goals then this is the game for you.  Pros: - More skills. Dear God the old game was lacking in skill variety, really noticable late game. Good to see they improved this. - Diologue is great! - Lore is great! - Deatail in game world - Humor, and a at times snarky narrator - Different ways of solving a quest  Pro/Con: - Graphicks are amazing as ever, but lag the heck out of your computer when you are in the forest/city and not in a building - Crafting is more streamlined but waaaay harder when experimenting as it's less straightforward as DOS1. Good/bad I don't know.  Cons: - Still a little bugy/brocken quests. Nothing too serious as there is ushally a work around. But I came accross my first broken quest bug in Act 2, as in no way to start it as item didn't appear in inventory. Also the game sometimes crashes, so be sure to save often, especially if you open up a new window to google something.  So there you have it a great game, and dare I say if the studio waited a month to release the game to fix these bugs the game may have even been called immaculate? Hope it gets some more patches soon!  EDIT: A little deeper into the game and a little saltier at some of the bugs, *cough* tarquin *cough* as I found a few more broken quest bugs.

Renegade994,97,2,0,"September 9, 2017",Recommended,181.5,"Already a phenomenal game, even in early access I encountered a bug maybe twice, and even at that it was not enough to take away from the amazing amount of fun and enjoyment I received from just the first 14 hours I played. Combat is deep and cinematic, both punishing and rewarding. Your party has their own fascinating stories and personalities, and the world your playing in feels chaotic and on the brink of complete anarchy. Its shaping up to be an excellent game, Im already finding myself both wanting more, and eagerly awaiting the September 14th release. The talent behind this game is beyond most developers of the day, and if you love Diablo, Baldur's Gate or similar RPG's this is a must have for your library, without a shadow of a doubt."

At some point it just started feeling like I had done it all before, and very few games truly felt unique or inspired to me.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now on the top of a small list of games that have really reminded me what it's like to have fun playing a video game.  Also, this game has made it seriously hard to justify the $60 price tag on almost any AAA game over the past several years, at least for me."

Score : 9/10   The story is very well written set in a fascinating world where CHOICES MATTER. The sidequests are very diverse unlike most games that are filled with fetch quests.   The turn-based combat is very engaging as it rewards you for controlling the battlefield and keeping everyone alive (very important). Patience is key here to prepare setups and counter some status effects (magic and physical).  The early game is VERY tough, much like Xcom 2 where your gears are underleveled so killing enemies at this point is frustatingly difficult even at Classic Mode. Also, once you're done with 1 major area, you'll have to move to a different region so you can't return back to finish any incompleted tasks. So take your time and LEVEL UP!"

There are few good game studios left out there, ones that really seem to love what they do and seem to be happy as long as they make money, not trying to squeeze every damn cent they can out of their fans, and more and more game studios seem to go this route, luckally we have some great studios that resist like CDPR and Larian, I try my best to not fall into brand loyalty and all that crap, but Larian really deserves it.

I could talk hours and hours about that magnificient game, but I don't have time for that. I'd rather play this over and over and over again.  The Soundtrack is amazing, and after playing 80hrs, listening to any song brings nostalgia. Each time I log back on this game, I wish I havn't played it already to revive this awesome story.  If you play the game like it should be played and you actually care for the dialogs, which are f**cking awesome btw, there's between 60/80 hours of play time ahead.  11/10.

Luis,"2,122",2,0,"October 15, 2017",Recommended,240.2,"Absolutely incredible.  Basically feels like going from Baldur's Gate 1 to 2 (though not quite, since that was continuing from low level to midrange and then to epic levels with the same narrative, and this is not that), since the new armor system involves you either taking advantage or PEELING off layers of armor before you can actually do things.  Positioning and elemental manipulation are somehow even more important this time around. Fortunately, a lot of the difficult encounters are not initiated until you finish a dialog, so one has plenty of time to position  the party as one sees fit.  The original one was an amazing game that I spent hundreds of hours on, but never actually finished. This so far  is shaping up to be an even more impressive experience that I will revisit over and over.   That being said, it is slightly disappointing that the premade dwarf character has extremely little relevance to the plot until the 4th act, and then it is tangential. Oh well."

The origin characters all have interesting stories and it's fun to reveal them. I also liked the main story more than the one from D:OS. Graphics are fine, the soundtrack is great.   The round based combat sometimes requires patience, especially with larger groups and enemies who are able to charm or cripple your characters. But it works. There are still some bugs which hopefully will be fixed over time."

I poured countless hours into the first D:OS and fell in love with the game. I was truly blown away by that game. When D:OS 2 became available as early access I immediately bought it to support Larian even though I waited til full release to play it. So far I've put 45 hours into the D:OS 2 and I'm playing on tactitian mode and I'm far from beating it but from everything I've seen so far this game further enhances and polishes the experience from the first game. I have zero complaints, this game is basically perfection. I highly recommend this game to anyone interested in the genre. It's a mechanicaly deep rpg with a great cast of characters, lore and combat. The game doesn't hold your hand and the story and quests unfold naturally. This isn't a game to rush through, you'll find the most joy out of it if you take your time and explore the world it has to offer.

I highly suggest you play coop because the dimension it adds to the game is so much fun as you and friend(s) just run into all the quirks and silliness. Every fight can be one if you just switch it up and try out new tactics.. or just get lucky! The amount of details and love put into this game makes AAA companies look like indie developers.  The game is not without its flaws, the crafting is shallower than it can be, some armors/weapons never would have a use in someone who wants to win, misclicking on things in battle can really mess up a long fight and turn the tide negatively and the rest is mainly just nit-picky stuff.   Overall this game is a solid product, it looks nice, it plays nice and its completely mastered the art of an rpg in a sandboxm, meaning you have rules and tools, but you can often abuse or mess around and accomplish things in interesting ways. This game is worth the cover charge and should be a no-brainer if you are on the fence and it is on sale!"

The things happening in this game are so well written, exquisitly described, the love scenes are just amazing to read. And you will hate, you will hate a lot of characters and you will wait hours and hours to be finally able to fight them and it will feel like revenge. You will curse in front of your PC, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you! die! eat this you piece of‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• BURN! Yeah, it is like that. Its an emotional game, talk to your characters, love them, hate them, see them evolve.  You will not believe the skill progress in this game, what you can become during this game... it will be sutil, slow,  but at some point it you will realize how terrifyingly powerful you are. And it feels good. And the game is still hard, battles are long and tactical. You can still die, but damn you can put up a fight. And the ending... amazing, Its very satisfying. You will not be dissapointed. It has its bugs and some uncompleted quests but nothing serious.  Enjoy amazing writing, amazing story, and amazing characters. It ended and all i have is an aplause.

A Lone Wolf Rogue who steal everyone but help those in need. A Noble Ranger Elf travel with Sebille. A Necromancer who I still don't know what to do with her. An Elf Ranger who I play Co-op with my friend.  A Fighter already out of Fort joy, A Noble Ranger Elf running around try to fine everything that we can do in Fort joy.

I didn't go far because I want to try to build a different class and see how they perform, I also wanna know what Fort Joy have to offer, and I enjoy it a lot...  Bewarn This game doesn't tell you what to do, this for some are bad... but for me, I believe others will love it. Don't know what to do? Ask around and you will find interesting side quest, and some hint of something bigger outside...This make discover more reward, no quest marker to make you feel like you're stupid or lazy quest writer who don't have to write a good paragraph because quest marker already done the job.  Reading also be negative for some, I'm Thai and English is my 2nd-language but still have trouble with it yet.  Gameplay Combat is turnbase which sadly turn others away... But believe me...This is Deep and every fastify Turn-Base game, making combo with class build, party and your surrounding make a turnbase game yet every dynamic and good gameplay.

Avascar,117,2,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,209.2,"What's makes an RPG? This game exceeds almost all of my expecations, and wipes away all of my fears. Engrossing writing, lovable characters, engaging combat, challenging choices, great soundtrack, and CO-OP. It's hard for me to not love this game in every aspect. And surely, it's a game that's difficult to top. Do note I will mostly talk about the main campaign, because it's what I put the most hours into.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a video game designed to look into your very soul, and asks a very direct question, 'Who are you?'. You can make a custom character, or one of the six origin characters (with specific dialogue, unique quests, and a generally different experience), and take part in an adventure alone, with NPC companions (with their own personality and relationship with you), or actual players. It goes back to the roots of RPG's, and gives you ultimate freedom to do and be whoever you want to be. To be whatever or whoever you want. And your choices matter, for every kill and every choice changes the world in some way. The world is real. You're in an adventure.  From the voice acted merchants, to the bustling cities and towns, you'll manage to find every nook and cranny as this game is filled with secrets only meant for the die-hard explorers. Different dialogue choices, hidden quests, OP loot, completely different outcomes; the world reacts to how you behave and what you know. Whether you decide to become the traditionalist hero, to the megalomaniac villian. The choice is ultimately up to you, and the game respects that. No choice nor fight is as black and white as they seem, as everyone in the story is both good and bad in their own rights (probably with the exception of the source king). It's a game you can't really have a ""perfect run"" on, choices will grant many different and branching choices based on what you do.  It goes back to the roots of RPGs from the days of Dungeons & Dragons, takes the modernism of current RPGs, and dosed with the whimsical love from Larian into a game that twists you as a whole, showing your true colors. In Co-op, it tests your relationships with your friends, as you must know only one out of the four adventurers can be Divine. It's a game that's both cooperative and yet slightly competitive, and it adds great storytelling to the entire experience.  Not only does the game contain loads of different dialogue, secrets, choices, and outcomes, it has some of the most revolutionary turn-based combat I've seen. Environmental effects from fire, rain, poison, and water. You can spend hours strategizing with your friends setting up the battlefields, as almost every enemy have their own weaknesses and strengths you must overcome. Each fight is interesting to their core, making you adapt to each situation in geography, location, environment, skills, and enemy types.  I only recently completed this game, and I realize it's one of those few games I'll have really fond moments of. It's a game where as soon as you beat it, you'll immediately start another run. I wouldn't mind paying for expansions, because the level of quality that Larian provides is amazingly superb. I don't want to give many spoilers to the game, it is full of many surprises that you must experience yourself. It's unforgettable, I tell you!  Of course, this game isn't perfect. Bugs are rather prevalent, as you literally can't get some achievements. Aside from bugs, I do wish there was more character development between my companions. This isn't an issue when all of your characters are actual people. But when they're NPC companions they don't talk very often, only during specific and important story scenes. If you play solo, there will be times when you don't notice their presence because they never have any dialogue to say, which is a shame in my opinion. I won't dabble on it much, but Act 4 is a bit lame as there isn't as much depth to it compared to Act 1 and 2. This entry of the series also messes up the timeline of the games, which puzzles many previous players like me. And the final boss isn't as magnificant as I wanted it to be (no multiple boss phases!?!).  There's also the Arena mode, which is an online PvP game mode. It's pretty dead, and it seems to be the most rushed out of the 3 (Campaign, Arena, and Game Master). You can only select a few presets of characters (no character nor skill customization), and in my experience I had trouble finding a match to play. I wouldn't play this for the Arena mode because it's pretty awful. The idea is great, but the execution just isn't there.  I also haven't managed to play much of the Game Master mode. A game mode that's quite literally Dungeons and Dragons. There's a rather small following for it, and there are custom campaigns out you can play right now. And from the looks of it, seems very fun. The combat is very streamlined, and the numbers are very easy to manage. I find it better than the use of spreadsheets, very long text documents, or literally piles of papers in my experience. But ultimately, it's personal preference.  But aside from that, everything about this game is fantastic. OST (Main theme, Rivellon, all the character theme songs), aesthetics (perhaps the humans and dwarves are a bit ugly looking), storytelling, dialogue, choices, secrets, combat, mod support, and so much more. Don't think my critiques give you the impression that they ruin the entire experience, because they don't. In the end, you'll feel like you finished an adventure. You mold the game, and yet the game molds you. The world of Rivellon reacts to your moves, with its inner gears shifting and moving. You will tell countless stories of it, I assure you.  So, what makes an RPG? The storytelling experience. And a storytelling experience that allows you to be in the eyes of a child, becoming whoever or whatever you want and having your choices matter in a significant way is an astonishing feat all on its own.  And that, is why I would easily give this game a 10/10. Simply revolutionary."
Mr. Sinister,154,2,0,"October 2, 2017",Recommended,83.2,"Finally. A ROLE playing game in this day and age.  So many small things to find, so many big things to explore. Walls of text.

Blood-Lord,119,2,0,"September 23, 2016",Recommended,170.0,"I don't normally prepurchase video games. However, for Larian Studios which created a fantastic game in Divinity: Original Sin I will gladly support this game as well.  Rock, Paper, Scissors: The game play seems close to the original, with minor tweaks and additional combat strategies to worry about. The one thing I've noticed that was missing is where is the rock, papers, and scissors argument from the first game? I loved disagreeing with my friends and having to do this mini game.  From what I can tell the game play feels smoother, looks crisper and the amount of details that they've added to the game. I feel like what ever I do might have repercussions through out the game. Also, they seemed to have created multiple ways of completeing quests, or taking different routes to do the same job.   Source:  I understand that source spending spells are much more powerful than non-source spending spells. However, I believe after even 1 play through gathering source will become tedious and cumbersome. There needs to be a better way to gather this resource than swapping a wand/item with vamperism among the players.  Source solution?: I would like to note that doing this to the dead bodies is very enjoyable. It makes the game that much more immerism. Not sure how to improve upon this to make it more efficent? Maybe devour all sourcible dead bodies around you with one spell cast? However, only the number of source points that you're missing. This will keep the immerism of the spell, yet make gathering this material that much faster.   Source Soul Jars: Side note on the source resource. If you're able to suck source from the undead with an item. Whats the significance of stealing the souls from those stuck in a jar? Aren't these source captures suppose to be more potent or have more of a permanent touch to the character? From absorbing these souls you're loosing out on experience and possibly dialog with characters in this world.  These should be rare and have an additional progress to the characters in their own way. Maybe such as leadership adds bounses to the character. Doing this will add minior bounces to the character who devoured the soul. Bracchus Rex was doing things similar to this and became extremely powerful. Why can't we?  Also, doing this should reduce your attitude towards people to balance this out. #DarksideFTW :D  Act 1 Final Battle: Most encounters in the first act I had no problem. I understand that this game takes tactical placement, and combat very serious. Which is why I love games like this. Admittedly I am no fool when it comes to games like this. However, I would like to address the final battle of act 1. I believe this battle to not be challenging... Just way over powered to the players level and gear.   My friend and I were level 8 with all the quests, and gear that we could get from this island. However, when we got to this it was like hitting a giant wall. Took us around 2-3 hours to complete this battle with numerious amounts of tactics. Finally, I gathered the idea of getting all the explosive oil/ooze barrels on the island that remained and blow Alex and the worm to hell.  Here is a screenshot of what we did to kill the bastard.  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769604881   Bug Dwarf Height: While going to Bracchus Rex's castle theres a part where you need to touch a gargoyle head to go through a portal. While doing this our dwarf in the party wasn't able to reach this gargoyle. Heres a screen shot of that below  http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769608678   Arena Dead but Still Kicking Bug: After doing the arena and loosing to my friend. I was killed, but immediately revived going back to the arena master. My walking animation looked like I was dead, but still moving. Heres a screen shots of that below.   http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769176176 http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=769176554   Overall, if you enjoy turn based, rpg, in depth tactical combat with a very in depth storyline and involvement. This is the game for you!  P.S: This review is bound to change if I think of anything else to add."
Sir Bartholomew,168,2,0,"October 2, 2017",Recommended,63.8,"What can I say that hasn't been said over 8,000 times? This game gives you complete control over what your character does and says. And I don't mean in the sense of ""Oh, I can walk over here and I have dialogue options."" I mean that if you don't like one of those Main Quest essential NPCs, you can attack and kill them. Few games take this risk, but Divinity: Original Sin 2 does and does it beautifully. It gives you options upon options on ways to accomplish your goals and completing quests. I have 25 hours in the game, all of them spent inside Fort Joy, re-loading, restarting and trying to make sure I didn't screw quests up. One quest has you find a dog's lost mate (if you have Pet Pal that is) and you eventually find her in the dungeons. Little did I know, if you escape the fort and then come back, every Magister and Source Hound will attack you on site. So I loaded back to make sure I could talk to the dog and complete the quest without killing his ex-mate.The game feels like a true virtualization of a DnD campaign. Where you choose your actions, the narrator narrates what happens and the world and people react. I've never played a game like this because I was always turned off to turn based combat in video games. But this game does it beautifully, incorporating strategy into the placement of every character and making the environment interactable with different elements and being able to use the landscape your advantage. The enemies can also do this, and will do it more as you turn up the difficulty. I had an enemy cast rain and, before my next turn, one of her cronies shocked my entire party. The rain and standing water caused by it allowing the spell to travel through the party. It's unbelievable what they were able to achieve with this game and I honestly can't wait to see what happens next"

Operator Rosell,46,2,0,"October 21, 2017",Recommended,35.1,"Bought the game 3 days ago. Playtime atm 17 hours. Need to be careful with this lads.  Pros -Amazing soundtrack. I have found myself stopped playing 2 times and just listening the soundtrack cause i think it might change if i enter other area. This has not happen to me since Final Fantasy 10. -NPCs are really well written and voice acted. I was amazed by Fane, The Red Prince and the Assasin dude in the beginning. Thats my 3 people party btw. -Turn based combat is really good. It is also challenging even on the lowest level on difficulty. -Game looks amazing with max graphic settings. The water makes me wanna jump in there and swim. -Quests and their completion is done really well. Not one quest feels like a chore and there is actually no direct markings on the map on where to go. It might show you a location of a NPC or location but the rest you have to figure out by yourself. Really nice oldschool vibe init. -I have only been out of the tutorial island and it took me 17 hours. I cant imgaine how much content there is for the rest of the game.  Cons: -Battle might be frustrating in the beginning if you are not familiar with the skills. It took me several attemps on several quests on the normal mode until my party was not demolished by the mobs. This is not really a bad thing cause we need more games that makes us learn the gameplay and try our best but i understand it might frustrate some poeple. -Camera. Camera is pain if you try to change the view all the time but you have to do it in order to loot everything. It takes some time to get used to.  Overall this game is really amazing. It gives me this deep athmospere like when i furst used to play Arcanum or Icewind dale. Totally recommended."
Tally,119,2,0,"November 28, 2017",Recommended,42.0,"Pros:  Absolutely epic!  Fantastic story, nicely done turn-based combat, huge character build variety with endless skill combos, beautiful environments & soundtrack.  There are things to see and do in every corner of the world.   ---  Cons: Camera controls are severely lacking.  The game is so beautiful and I can't see most of it because of the awful camera controls.  Quest tracker leaves a lot to be desired.  I feel like when the fate of the world is hanging in the balance and there is much work to be done, your hero should be writing down a bit more detail in their journal.  ""My lizard friend wants me to find a lizard.""  That's it, no detail and pestering your lizard friend yields no additional information.  I'm just supposed to walk around and talk to EVERY npc until I find the right one.  There is a fair amount of back & forth that is starting to feel tedious.   For example: you stumble upon Z location, but in order to progress through the zone you need X item that is found in Y location.  Go to Y location.   In order to progress through Y location and obtain X item, you must travel to B location to do a quest and unlock a special ability. Go to B location to do said quest and obtain the special ability. Return to Y location, obtain X item, return to Z location. Basically every main story quest is like this, maybe it's because it's my first play through and I'm still learning, but it's getting a little repetitive.  At 25 hours in my save game seems to be getting a bit bloated.  I had this game on my mechanical hard drive and it takes a solid 5 minutes to load Reaper's Coast.  It's a bit less on an SSD but still pretty bad.  ---  Despite all of that, I still think that this game is absolutely worth every penny.  I can see myself playing this game for a long time."

audaciousgenre,246,2,0,"October 23, 2017",Recommended,365.8,"One of the most flexible, polished, detailed, and generally enjoyable games I've ever played. If you like RPGs, you should play this game. Easy to pick up, gameplay can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be.   Every character and NPC is voice-acted with individual dialogue, even down to the animals wandering around town - I've never encountered two NPCs who said the same thing. This may not sound huge, but it's a subtle effort that makes the entire experience far more immersive than I've seen in a game. For instance, talking to every random person in a town never feels boring or a chore. It's one of many seemingly minor decision by the creators that elevates the polish and feel of the game above other RPGs, and exemplifies the attention to detail put into every aspect of the game.   The mechanics are great, the graphics are great, controls are great, crafting is good (haven't played with it too much yet), music, writing and voice-acting are absolutely top-notch, skill/magic trees are flexible and mean you can essentially turn anyone in your party into whatever you want. Build archers who also summon and buff creatures to fight for you, two-handed-axe-wielding close-combat necromancers, seriously whatever you want.  I love this game - I'm not even halfway through it, but I already want to start another party just to try out new party builds.  Just get it, unless you're on a serious budget, and even then, it's probably worth skimping on groceries or something this month."

Luis,"2,122",2,0,"October 15, 2017",Recommended,240.2,"Absolutely incredible.  Basically feels like going from Baldur's Gate 1 to 2 (though not quite, since that was continuing from low level to midrange and then to epic levels with the same narrative, and this is not that), since the new armor system involves you either taking advantage or PEELING off layers of armor before you can actually do things.  Positioning and elemental manipulation are somehow even more important this time around. Fortunately, a lot of the difficult encounters are not initiated until you finish a dialog, so one has plenty of time to position  the party as one sees fit.  The original one was an amazing game that I spent hundreds of hours on, but never actually finished. This so far  is shaping up to be an even more impressive experience that I will revisit over and over.   That being said, it is slightly disappointing that the premade dwarf character has extremely little relevance to the plot until the 4th act, and then it is tangential. Oh well."

Ghouleh,354,2,1,February 18,Recommended,318.0,"A beautiful cluster****.   Full disclosure - the only other game in the Divinity series I've ever played to completion is Dragon Commander, which couldn't be more different than this one.  I didn't enjoy Original Sin 1. I didn't get it. It was so strange to me - because it was a mechanics-focused RPG. Everything interacted with everything else, and the possibilities seemed endless. The story didn't grab me, and such things are important in a cRPG, and so I eventually abandoned it.  Initially, I was afraid I would feel the same about Original Sin 2. The first act isn't particularly strong, but thankfully, I endured for enough time for the story to sink its hooks into me. Ironically enough, it was only then that I realized all of Original Sin 2's virtues, which have little to nothing to do with its plot.   The Mechanics Original Sin 2, like its predecessor, is about the absolutely ludicrous shenanigans you can pull off both in and out of combat. Environmental hazards are everywhere, from water to blood to poison to ice to fire- and they interact in often explosive ways to different skills, items and spells. The game gives you access to the game-changing Teleport skill very early on, and this is what blows the whole thing wide open. With it, you can teleport any character or item, anywhere within sight. The sheer amount of battlefield and exploration applications were enough for me to force all my party members to learn it. Teleport party members across chasms, onto vantage points. Teleport distant enemies to kill zones, environmental hazards, or on top of one another.   Another beautiful example is the dialogue system. Namely - dialogue only freezes the characters that are actively engaged in said dialogue. Whilst your main character is speaking to a soon-to-be-hostile NPC, the rest of your party can get into position, set up traps and hazards, pickpocket the distracted NPC, or even teleport them around the map, all before combat even starts.  Divinity Original Sin 2 is very exploitable by nature. The amount of cheese strategies available to creative players is utterly disgusting - and this is clearly intentional, and I love Larian for it. I watched a video that involved the almost useless Telekinesis skill, which is used solely for moving and picking up objects at the distance - used to instagib monsters and NPCs by way of shoving an ultra-heavy crate filled with other, ultra-heavy crates.  You can customize your characters to a laudable degree, even with the option of making them Undead, which of course brings all sorts of wacky interactions, such as having to steal faces not to be attacked on sight, being damaged by healing  but healed by poison. You can create your characters if you wish, or you can use pre-built characters the game already has. In truth, there is no downside to this. The advantage of pre-built characters is that they have their own voice actors, personalities and, critically, personal quests which they progress through along with the game's main quest. You can customize everything else about them during character creation - class, attributes, even appearance. There are very few upsides to playing a non-pre-built character.  You can have a party of up to 4 characters (there are 6 pre-built characters), or up to two Lone Wolves(a talent which makes characters stronger, but limits them to a party of two). You must choose a -main- character, though you can choose any among your party to partake in dialogue. You will largely see the world through the eyes of your chosen main character.   tl;dr - A blast. I was foolish not to have realized it before.    The Story and Characters Larian has always had a distinct style that blends fantasy and humor. In that, they remain entertaining as ever. The story, as I've said before, took a while before showing what it is truly about, but once it did, it remained engaging throughout. The plot itself isn't as good as an Obsidian would make it, and the characters are more threadbare than Bioware would craft them - but they're good, make no mistake.  I've heard some confusion from longtime fans of the Divinity series about if this game is a prequel or a sequel to some earlier games in the franchise. There doesn't seem to be much consensus, as it could be either, with radically different implications for each possibility. As a person who hasn't played the games that more directly tie into this one, such as Divine Divinity and the Dragon Knight games, things can sometimes seem disjointed and barely explained. Lucian, the Black Ring, Deathfog and the fall of the elven kingdoms, Source and Sourcerers(and how it is different from ordinary magic), Godwoken - It all took a while to fit into place.   And Malady? I was profoundly confused. I like the character, but she seems to drop from the sky at the end of Act I and takes the reins of the entire plot with little to no explanation about the whos, whys and whats. And- heck, Windego, the game's intro narrator. Why she narrates the plot, and seems to take such an important role in narrating the ending - is a mystery.  The game's characters are mostly serviceable. The pre-built party members are a cut above the rest. Well, all except Beast. I remain disappointed how dwarves are depressingly similar in all of fantasy. Putting on a pirate hat doesn't make one different enough. They even have elves in Divinity be gangly cannibalistic weirdos - but dwarves remain dwarves.  The endings are also a disjointed mess, full of moving parts and stuffed at the end of a final battle that ends rather abruptly(and lets not forget the blatantly defective or just badly designed Anathema questline, which pays off about as much as the Mutated Toe in Fallout 2). Still, there's no denying that they're a better payoff than, let's say, Tyranny's endings.  The cRPG genre has fierce competition in story and writing, and I believe that Larian found a handy way to go about things: The interveawing between the main plot and the individual (pre-built)character stories. The grandiose story runs the risk of making a protagonist feel like a nameless, faceless nobody that murderhobos his way to the end - but each character's personal quest is craftily sewn into the world's larger story, which gives precious context and a feeling of being connected to the game's events. This shouldn't be overlooked.   Finally, Original Sin's Pet Pal talent returns triumphantly, allowing you to speak to each and every animal in the game, which not only grants you access to tons of new quests and content, but also up the comedic factor by several orders of magnitude. I will never forget the amazing bringing the sole survivor chick Peeper on an epic journey to find his Sourcerer father, the epic rooster Magicockarel.   In Conclusion It's pretty good! A mechanics-focused cRPG that teleports you‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•first into a barrel of fun."

Sandwich Boy,400,2,0,March 13,Recommended,27.6,"This is one of the most immersive games I've played in years.  The graphics are great for a CRPG, the story is engrossing, and every line of dialogue is fully voiced.  There is so much depth in every aspect of the game.  The character customization, crafting system, and combat are some of the best I've seen in any game, let alone any CRPG.  Combat encounters are difficult without feeling unfair.  Others may feel differently, but as a casual player, I found the ""classic"" difficulty setting to be just about perfect.  Combat is turn-based, but it is sort of a mix between tactical turn-based combat, and the classic RTS-Style combat of games such as Baldur's Gate. Players are definitely rewarded for being creative in combat, so simply running the party headlong into an encounter isn't always the best strategy.  The Divinity world has some interesting twists on the generic fantasy setting.  Each quest and side quest feels unique, and characters (even minor characters), are interesting and realistic.  This game also has some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in an rpg, which is crazy, given how much dialogue there is.  The attention to detail is absolutely amazing, resulting in tons of secrets to uncover in the world, as well as complex interactions between items, characters, etc.  Here's a fun example: When a character is wounded in (or out) of combat, blood can splatter onto the ground.  This blood can be frozen, resulting in a slippery patch of ice on the ground, or struck with a bolt of lightning, shocking anyone who is touching the puddle.  The blood could also be absorbed for health by a necromancer.  Somehow the game doesn't feel like it has a steep learning curve, despite all of this richness and complexity.  There's a lot more to say, but I'll keep this review short.  If you have any interest in CRPGs, or RPGs in general, you should check this game out."

Nethys/BlackViking,335,2,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,80.9,"The Co-op is pretty fantastic, with split screen and online gameplay available. 4-player Co-op is huge, especially when each character has their own backstories, motives, and alignments. Some quests mean you gotta talk to someone, someone else may want that person dead. Sometimes you even gotta fight your friends in a fun arena-style system. Combat is amazing, especially when you have the turn-based gameplay to help stage brutal combos to dispatch multiple enemies. From exploiting elements, to staging ambushes for the enemy you just turned into a chicken, the options are vast. Story so far is pretty ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing good. As I stated initially, everyone has their own upbringings and goals that sometimes conflict or align at various parts of the plot. While the beginning of the game seems very linear (""We gotta get out of this place!"") The variety of methods and questlines to accomplish that is guaranteed to bring in a second playthrough. I recommend this game to people who enjoy co-op gameplay, intricate stories, or just solid fantasy RPGs; this game has been a hit on all fronts for me and it feels good to play a sequel that just comes out better than the previous game.

[EU] DeliveryBoi,325,2,0,July 26,Recommended,165.9,"I consider this the game of the year 2017.  The gaming industry has been lacking super high-quality AAA games that simply tried to create the best possible game in its respective genre - without trying hard to cash-grab and overly cut costs where you really shouldnt. The reception of Witcher 3 simply showed how starved consumers are for such quality-games.  Divinity Original Sin 2...  The game looks absolutely gorgeous. Stunning islands, stunning characters, amazing colors - a feast for the eye.  The universe the developers created is interesting and overall excellent and suits the genre perfectly by adding that extra touch of insanity and therefore supporting player-choices which, quite frankly, are going to be insane more often than not.  The ""R"" in RPG? Delivered.  Replayability - The game often delivers a lot of significant choices how you can influence the world around you and a ton of ways to solve (or terribly mess up) the things you encounter.  Innovation - Modding-support needs to be counted for this one. You can create adventures, mod the base game and even have a complete game-master mode. Features like crafting are an interesting touch for such a game, but can be entirely ignored if youre not into that. Spoiler, if you havent watched the trailer yet:  You can speak with animals, if you pick a trait for that. That's absolutely incredible. Animals simply connect to us on a whole different level. Who wouldnt be touched by some poor, sad puppy eyes, even if its just a game?  The ground-effect based combat is also a nice touch with several connections to that.  The game is fully voiced and even has a narrator. If you really listen closely you can hear that not every voice actor was perfect, but come on, the game is fully voiced and I'm really nitpicky here. Can't hire the best voice actors for a thousand characters and have all of them perform on the same level.  I've got to criticise though that the multiplayer does not have a multiplayer-dialogue function. What I mean by that is that the first player who clicks on the NPC gets to do all the talking without the input of the others. Sure, you can punch each other in Teamspeak and start complaining about choices, but that's no fun. There's a PvP function in the game, but I dont really feel like that's the thing I'd like end up with when I start up a >Coop< session. There should be something like dice-rolls and whoever gets the highest rng, gets to say his line. Something like SWOTOR?.   TL;DR The game offers serious bang for the buck and I'd struggle if you asked me for more recent games of such high quality."
Jaxim,329,2,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,154.0,"I've been pretty burned out on gaming for a few years now, and I've constantly been searching for games that can give me the sense of joy and wonder that I used to feel. At some point it just started feeling like I had done it all before, and very few games truly felt unique or inspired to me.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is now on the top of a small list of games that have really reminded me what it's like to have fun playing a video game.  Also, this game has made it seriously hard to justify the $60 price tag on almost any AAA game over the past several years, at least for me."
Tesla_Foxx,106,2,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,16.1,"If you're a fan of classic RPG style gaming (I.e. Baulders Gate, Diablo, D&D, etc.) then this will be your salvation from the lack of major titles in the genre. It stays true to its table top roots while also giving a stylish spin to everything we've had to use our imagination for over the years. The combat is fast paced and tactical. Everything is a weapon, including the environment. It really comes down to what you have available to you and what you can think up with each situation. The story is well written and engaging. It keeps you hooked to see how your particular play through pans out in the grand scheme of the world. Plus the mulitplayer support adds a lot of fun and interesting ideas to the mix. Such as your companions (either real people or a.i.) will each view the quests differently and have different motives and reasoning for every action. Sometimes things work out, other times you end in a bloody brawl after a quest choice turns sour. Each adventure breathes a wealth of choices and possibilities. Don't forget the game master mode either! Being able to create your own adventures for your friends, or anyone for that matter, to battle through is worth the price in itself. There will always be new content to play or create to keep this game going for ages. PVP is also included to add that pinch of competition outside of your main campaign that turns into a explosive game of wits before you know it. All in all, I'd recommend this to anyone seeking adventure or a little more ""choice"" out of their game. Have fun solo or with friends as you fight to replace the divine that the world has lost. May your blades and mind be sharp!"

The difficulty of battle and the thought that goes into strategy of it all is incredible, although i am biased since i am a huge fan of turn based fights. Can be a bit infuriating at first since most fights you'll get into at first will pretty much destroy you until you get a handle on how it all works.  All in all its a lot to take in at first and that can be discouraging, but pushing through and spending time playing the game and before you know it you'll be enjoying this game more then you thought you would."

Draenei For Life (Josh),239,2,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,105.4,"GAME OF THE YEAR FOR ME. ALSO if you play this game keep the black cat alive, trust me its so worth it.   SO the good things about this game: The story/writing has vastly been improved saince the first game, I loved the first one but the story never really pulled me in, this one however pulls me in within the first hour. The combat is still as fun and tactical as the first, with far more combinations of spells and abilities (plus waaayyy more spells, classes and abilities in general). The character creation is fun, its not too long and crazy but allows you to make (or customize an existing character) to be the character you wanna play. The companions are all detailed with decent stories and they all have different impacts on the storyline and each other. Gamemaster Mode is incredible fun, it feels like the D&D campaign creator I've always wanted. This game has up to 4 player multiplayer for the full game, so if you have the friends jump into this with them.   Few neutral things: The music is kind of average, a few fun tunes but feels generic. The crafting system is no longer a cluster of confusing rubbish, so its not a negative, it still doesn't feel very important though, on my solo playthrough and playthrough with friend we both ignore it as it feels still not that useful. Arena mode is a rare giggle but feels kind of incomplete. While its very true many quests allow you to do them  in different ways which is fab, some of them matter little, you will be given like 5 options (if you find them all) to finish a certain part however, you can just run back and do the other options for extra xp for killing them (as I do) making the choice slightly pointless.  Bad things for me (or things I think others will hate): The amount of races is fun (including undead versions), however, it feels like every race is here in vast quantities, no race feels rarer. If you do not like turn based combat this game is NOT FOR YOU AT ALL. Your characters pathing when you tell them to go someone in a fight will still decide to  casually run through fire/poison etc, or sometimes attacks of opportunity make ZERO sense. Gamemaster Mode has no way of making character talk, its all up to the GM. Now this last comment is something that just personally annoys me, but when you need to  help a character in a fight (or save them) they have this tendency to just go full in and take huge quantities of damage, they seem to have dumb AI compared to actual enemies.  I hope my review gave some insight on whether to purchase this game."

Tyrvali,91,2,0,"May 15, 2017",Recommended,201.8," Divinity: Original Sin 2  So, Divinity: Original Sin 2...  I have to say several things about this game before I properly review it. 1) It's in early access alpha at the time of review. 2) Only Act 1 is available, alongside an Arena mode. 3) I loved Divinity: Original Sin  Ok, so, for people who loved the first one, this is a must buy. Even at its current stage of development, which Larian Studios are constantly working on and updating, this is amazing. I have played through the first act as several different characters.  Each playthrough has been similar and different in unique ways. For example, I tried to playthrough the game as a solo Elf Cleric.  The Voidworm fight was nearly impossible for me . I then tried a proper playthrough, using a full party. My character was a Dwarf Rogue. Not only are the classes and races completely different, the combinations of combat were entirely different and I loved it.  I will not lie, however. To people who A) haven't played Divinity: Original Sin, it could be hard to get used to, despite the tutorial help boxes. B) Some elements of the story can break. For example, if Gavin dies before making it back to the camp, you cannot progress in his quest. Note: This is not a game-breaker.  Overall: Since I loved the original, I purchased this game early into its alpha. So far, I've loved every minute. I can't wait for the full release of this masterpiece. Thank you, Larian Studios!  UPDATE: With the full release of the game, I am extremely excited to keep playing. Starting an undead elf character was the first thing I did. I am almost done with Act 1 at the moment and have discovered so many quests, characters and items I previously had no idea about. There are so many things to do and many quests to complete.

jenn_geoffroy,182,2,0,October 2,Recommended,245.1,"I play RPGs for the story. I play strategy games for the tactical puzzles. In RPGs, the combat is (at best) an okay distraction between story points, and if there's a role-playing way to avoid a fight, I'll usually take it. In strategy games, the story is a thin trope-ridden veneer I mostly ignore.  Then along comes the DOS games. The only RPGs with a story I really really WANT to finish, alongside fights I will make a detour to take on. I'll still avoid fights with persuasion and roleplaying when I can, because I like the immersion and playing a clever character, but in DOS2, I'll loop back after obtaining my objective, plant as many barrels of oil and ooze I can find next to the enemy I conned into letting me run around, and then light them up like a roman candle before taking them down.  There's some good funny moments. Some gory creepy moments. Some really really hard moments (yikes, the crucial reveal in Lohse's story GUTTED me - it even gutted the hard-case who was guiding me on that quest, that's saying something as to how heartwrenching a choice needs to be made). And there's moments when you finally kill someone who's been irritating you for awhile by turning him into a chicken before giving him a final whack and shouting IN YOUR FACE as he explodes or something. Ahhh, good times, good times....  (Edited to remove potential light spoiler from Lohse's quest, never know...)"

Chris,273,2,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,131.8,"Bang up ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing game. Seriously, best RPG in many, MANY years. I haven't ever really reviewed a game before, so I'm going to give it my best shot. This game is about as close to DND on a digital medium that you can get while still being its own game. Fully interactive environment, (tons of fire, electricuting water, exploding oil and poison) and the developers really played with it.  Just a small spoiler alert, but to just put it in perspective how the environment comes into play. There's one fight pretty far into the game on top of a mountain of wreckage. Out of absolutely nowhere, tons of oily blobs come to kill you. Every time you damage them, and they move, they spread oil. So the whole time, you're trying to batter them down as you move up the mountain to get away from them. The dev's then have it to where when the oily guys finally go down, TONS of fire guys show up and ignite all the oil. I know its kinda hard to get it across, but fighting ontop of this giant mound with fire everywhere trying to batter down the fiery slimes, seriously felt cool.   Character creation wise, I mean it's pretty good. Not a ton of customization, just standard face 1, 2, 3, etc. But honestly not a big deal. As you develop what your character is good at, you grow to love em.  Classes are pointless, you build your character the way YOU want to, so they can literally become anything. I've got a few characters going, and all feel super unique and diverse. A dwarven rogue shapeshifter who can grow a tentacle arm and smack people around as well as shed all enemies magical resistances to support, I've got a fire slinging geomancer who uses oil‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to explode just about everyone, and I've got a necromancer archer who summons tons of undead corpses to explode all over people. It all feels super unique and fun to play. There's times where I miss my other characters, hop on them to play, and then miss the one I was just playing. Kinda neat.  If you want my advice, 100+ hours advice, PLAY WITH FRIENDS. Preferrably in person. Hit up an old school lan party feel, bring cpu's over, build a SUPER diverse cast of characters, and hunker down. Pizza and beer obviously. Plan for an all nighter, because I literally PROMISE you you'll be playing til 6am EASY. I haven't personally had a game grab me like that in many years, and god damn its a good feeling to have back. Go larian, you guys are the men and women making games great again.  10/10."

Greendetective,47,2,0,"April 30, 2017",Recommended,127.9,I was very skeptical about this game.  How can a top down SRPG not be boring?  But after some persuasion from a friend i finally decided to buy it and play it with them and lo' and behold i was astounded by how fun this game is.  The puzzles and battles are the most strategic and amazing srpg battles I seen with environmental destruction being an awesome gimmick. The story is simple yet effective with a huge world with plenty to do and graphics are amazingly beutiful.  I was never bored playing it.  It will be amazing to see this game get finished and voice acting added(which is in the orginal Divinity).  But for an early access it does give you a good taste of the game and you can tell the finished product will be great.
Moogie,171,2,0,"September 25, 2017",Recommended,97.9,"Loved the first game, despite its flaws. I feel like this game fixes every issue the first game had and across the board improves on it - my hat off to Larian Studios for listening to feedback.   While the story and setting is darker, there is so much humor sprinkled into this game. With the addition of voice acting, I find myself listening to everything. I didn't know how to feel about the narration at first, but it has grown on me and I feel like it's a great addition to the game. The Origin stories are a neat touch, I am doing my first playthrough as Lohse and I feel like mine is the most interesting of the group. Definitely want to try Fane next.  Overall, its a beautiful game with great little details hidden everywhere. (Also the music is great)  I have a hard time coming up with any real criticisms of the game, but I will try. I wish there was a better loot system - i play ranged and I just never get to loot anything, which isn't very fun. Some of the quests I've run into were bugged, so that's a bummer but I'm sure they'll be fixed in the near future and I can do them on my Tactician playthrough. I feel like playing with 4 people pulls the game into too many directions, I miss stuff that other people are doing and everyone wants to have the feeling of exploration - that's not really a game flaw, I just think it'd be a better experience with 1-2 players."
Jentleman Jack,39,2,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,63.2," This game was just godly, the choices, the dialogue, exploration and combat.  The story, or stories more like, was truly engaging as was building a connection with the characters.  And with the choices to create my own, I did just that, an avatar to interact with the world set together by the true gods.  I quite enjoy the presence of sophisticated types regardless of how rude they may be, along with my affinity for lizard-like races, chose to be a blue ocean in the form of a lithe lizard, who with a mixture of bow and magic, controlled my enemies, and aided my allies.  On my journy was my three companions who have more than proved their friendship.   To begin was the vocals of the group, Lohse who with her mastery of summoning, most disconcerning interest in electrocution along with her words of encouragement(and madness) made for a friend worth staying in the back with and babying the rough'n'tough boys when they've had too much of a spanking.   Then theres the Beast who, in-spite of being quite short, excelled at movement, cutting down enemies as quickly as knocking them onto their‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and with being a dwarf and a pirate no less, was enthusiastic, joyous and free as a dwarven pirate should be, whilst Lohse was the voice to the song, the Beast would always be the first to sing along.   And last, but definitely no least was the understandably arrogant Red Prince, tamer of flames, a true beefcake to my slender form, and as brutal with the shield as he is with his sword.  And somewhere along the lines his ""Fire"" met my ""Water"" and together created steam if you know what I mean, sure he was destined to another, but this here was the closest thing to true love.  Hm, but how far exactly did that ""love"" go, if you catch my meaning, meh, a fan-fiction to keep to my own.   But the hardest part about all of this, the story, your companions, was saying goodbye in the end, to say, this is it.  To end the journey and part ways with those of which you have made it so far with was quite heart wrenching.  I almost didn't want to say goodbye, but a story has to end.  For me, I would have wanted to keep playing after the epilogue, to be a god and explore the world as a one-lizard band.  Maybe even return to the Ancient Empire, see how everything fares with the Red Prince, share a few drinks, and reminisce upon our old adventures.  Perhaps we even get the whole gang together for another adventure, just like good old times.  But to say goodbye, to say goodbye was so hard, to part ways with friends, those who have been together with you through so much, is always hard, and sometimes, imagination alone isn't enough to mend the emptiness filled by adventures, especially ones with those you have melded with.    I guess this is more a tale rather than an actual review, or perhaps it is a review in the shape of a tale but even with the very small flaws in this diamond, I shall cherish this game for what it accomplishes.  A good story, a world full of surprises and secrets, and a band of friends I would forever play god with til' the end.  But I demand nothing more from Larian studios for they have made their sacrifices to deliver something no triple A game developer could get quite right.  I shall see to it that I myself create new adventures, because with the tools Larian has provided, we can all become story tellers, and we can all be pathfinders for our own adventures. -10/10 ...Would definitely adventure again."

pinkpinnn,248,2,0,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,122.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 - 2017 GEM.  Finding a game that mixes RPG, D&D, customizable class/ characters, good story telling, beautiful aesthetics, crafting system, tactical turn based battle, and option to play co-op? This game pretty much offers it all up on a silver plate.  I've played the first Divinity Original Sin, and my impression of that wasn't so strong, however I decided to give this a try, and it definitely floored me.  None too many games I've played have done a swell job in buffing lores, stories, and open ended quests for you to explore. You don't have to be a lore-lover or a rouge type gamer to enjoy this. There's a sweet spot for everyone. I went looking for a plain old adventure-with-consequences game, and spent more time reading up short lores here and there instead of speeding through it.  I can't believe I've spent 80+ hours (solo play) and still haven't completed it yet. Actually for the first chapter, I managed to spend 8-9 hours (and this was just purely exploring and figuring out quests). Halfway through the game, it even conjured up my nostalgia for Dragon Age 1.   CONS/ AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:  -Sometimes there are NO warnings before huge consequences take place. And when it happens, it's too late to alter (unless you are bothered to load up a game save 1 hour ago+). This happened a few times for me, the most painful one for me being: I couldn't take my companions to the next chapter because I'd missed that one window to convince them. They were absolutely gone. I loaded a previous save, but ever since that happened, I ended up tracking quests on wikia instead in fear of a major slip up -Quest journals are sometimes vague, and you will be left wondering or wiki-ing what the next step should be -Some quests feel un-finished or un-polished, as there may only be ONE, OBSCURE way of completing it -Not a must, but nice to have: Camera angle needs more rotation flexibility -No option to hide the HUD  PROS:  -The battle system constantly makes you look for the best spots to prepare and engage. Whenever you think you've got your ""go-to"" strategies nailed down, the game manages to switch it up just a little to make it challenging (+fun) again -Attention to detail towards the environment and the overall atmosphere. I don't always stop and look at the shadows of leaves and trees in a game. Each chapter is a map with it's own characteristics -Memorable background sound and music <3 Well done Borislav Slavov  -EVERY character has a voice! And voice acting is just ace -Main companions have decent back stories, although 1 or 2 still seem like pompous ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s after 20 hours -HIGH replayability value -Co-op offers extra fun if you want play with you rmates, and most things work smoothly. Just take note of the connectivity menu, and make sure to set your game privacy, as random people can enter your game and hijack your acharacter completely. -Dungeon master mode! For those who are into D&D this might be an interesting mode to check out  TO THINK THIS GAME WAS BACKED BY A KICK STARTER AND DEVELOPED + LAUNCHED UNDER 3 YEARS!  It's not easy balancing and taking in multiple opinions and ideas and delivering on something this decent. I suspect good team work somewhere in Larian Studios. The game is decent enough for me to overlook the annoying flaws (for now). And major game developing companies? You guys better brush up your A game. Top notch graphics aren't the only thing that makes a game immersive and great.  ANYWAYS...JUST...Just ..go play it!"

briancourt2,105,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,168.1,"Was hesitant becasue of the turn based combat.  But thought hey XCOM was ""turn based"" just the like. This game is really well done.  Sure one might actually have to read a few things, but if you like some elements of old RPG games with todays world of graphics, this is an awesome game.  The choices are well thought through, with many options available based on who is simply talking.  It is not a click anywhere type of choice, as you don't get to go back and chose the right path after failing the 3 bad choices.  In that regard the game pace is slowed down. Battles take time to rethink and strategize.   Sometimes you just are not ready, and you need to find better equipment.  The combat systems is pretty much about putting out more damage than the other team can heal and deliver back.  If you ventured into a higher level, there is a good chance you will simly die.  That challange makes it hard to figure out, if you have not found the right strategy or if you need to wait.  Great game.  Well done.

I'm a huge fan of Dungeons and Dragons, I have a group that plays every week, and for the days when I'm not playing, this is the game that will scratch that itch.  There is so much to say about the game even in the small amount I've played, but the long and the short of it is that the sheer amount of choice it gives you is incredible. Already between my two campaigns I've seen large changes between interactions with characters, different quests, and different class combos. I'm very excited to see everything this game has to offer.  And as a final point, I can't believe that this is an Indie game. In my opinion, this is as entertaining as almost any triple A I've played in the last fair while. I believe anyone who enjoys the fantasty/adventure/D&D genre will enjoy this game, absolutely worth the buy!"
Ihnspyre,193,2,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,23.3,"This is a cRPG done right:  -  awesome graphics -  fantastic combat and background mechanics -  a lot of freedom -  nice voice acting -  very nice soundtrack  The game is a must buy, Larian did almost everything right in the production department, they listened to critics from the first game, they responded positively to suggestions from fans and worked a lot to improve their game.   This game is exactly that, a very WELL MADE cRPG BUT it lacks a few things that some cRPG fans love about the genre.   Firstly, nothing you see in this game is especially interesting from an artistic point of view. The maps are quite big and full of quests and things to do but there aren't too many WAH moments where you can just admire the artistic design of the map. They are mostly FUNCTIONAL and full of content but uninteresting. While games like Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity have awesome dungeon designs, awesome towns (Twin Elms etc.) and fantastic visual landscapes, D:OS 2 has classic maps with meh design and a lot of secrets.   Most of the game has a lighthearted style of writing, classic personalities for characters, kind of boring lore and story. There aren't too many memorable moments throughout the game (I got very close to the end of the game before getting bored of it on another shared account, bought it for Larian deserved support and future updates + multiplayer) and it really does nothing special except for the combat and mechanics (which are great!). The thing is that we are used to cRPGs full of bugs or questionable developer attitude and when an RPG like D:OS 2 comes out, without a lot of bugs, with a lot of content and fantastic gameplay, well, we tend to overrate it.   The humour was okay, not good and not bad. The party dynamics is not as good as Pillars of Eternity and that cRPG is more suitable for my taste (with complex lore and story, a lot of party interaction, fantastic artistic design and soundtrack).   Overall, Larian deserve a lot of support for being awesome hardworking devs but not for imagination, originality or artistic skills."
Mokona,31,2,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,22.7,"This review is just based on my first impressions of the game. Its worth getting.  There is an insane amount of skills and combos you can do that a single play through will never allow you to see all the cool stuff you can do so the replay value is high. My favorite thing I've discovered in the game is the way recruiting followers works. First you must convince them to follow you to begin with, they dont just come along because you are the ""chosen one"" or some crap. To boot if you like a character you dont have to worry about him being a mage when you are already a mage because each character asks you what you want them to be. No longer are you forced to not take your favorite npc with you or forced to play a class you dont like just to take it with you. You can finally have a balanced party full of npc you find interesting hurrah.  The only thing I would ""complain"" about is the lack of non human races. You got human, dwarf (small human), elf (vegetarian human), and lizard man (finally its not a human). Skeleton variations of all is nice to throw in but I honestly am just done with every fantacy game haveing there races be the 3 over used races, human, elf, dwarf, and then a final race being there own ""custom"" race that just turn out to be another human but blue or something like that. Glad we got lizard men but wish we had a few more.  This game has a lot of thought put into it and it somehow didn't lauch at the $60 price point, with mod support. I expected this to be as dissapointing as pillars of eternity was but just jumping into the character creation and I was already loving the game."

It's the best CRPG I've played since the old school ones, and then adds more mechanics and better story telling.   Pros: -Elemental Interactions -Companions so good I had a hard time picking who to bring in my party -Fun combat and mechanics -Excellent puzzle design for Acts I and II, and just really really good puzzle design in Act III.  -Compelling storyline, that ties in neatly with the other Divinity games, without requiring you to play them (though you should) -No microtransactions, season pass, loot boxes, etc.  -Able to respec your character as much as you want -Excellent skill management system -Excellent crafting systems -Excellent visuals in regard to spell effects and great art design -Excellent RPG elements, relative to character creation, talents, skills and tags -The music is off the charts for the most part -Great voice acting and sound design -Choices that actually matter during the story and change the story -Oddly descriptive ""intamacy"" scenes if you romance a character (is that a pro, maybe, it was well written) -Difficult enought that I was challenged and died plenty on the second highest difficulty, but never felt frustrated enough to quit or scum the game -Excellent game, because there's no other word I can use to describe it.   Cons: -Had a crashing issue during a few of the cut scenes between Acts -Music repeats a lot if you're repeatedly getting in and out of combat -Items like arrows and grenades get auto added to your hot bar, and I constantly had to clean it out for skills to be in the order I want, playing as a polymorph character I had a lot of skills appearing and disappearing between combat  Overall, you should play this game if you like turn based CRPGs, RPGs in general, turn based games, good games or even if you just want to support a great indie game dev. It reminded me of Dark Souls 1, where when I finished my first playthrough, I instantly made a new character, and started to play again with a completely different play style.

The origin characters all have interesting stories and it's fun to reveal them. I also liked the main story more than the one from D:OS. Graphics are fine, the soundtrack is great.   The round based combat sometimes requires patience, especially with larger groups and enemies who are able to charm or cripple your characters. But it works. There are still some bugs which hopefully will be fixed over time."

Morr-gan,334,2,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,116.6,"The game's start is an extremely, extreeeemely steep learning curve.  you essentially start off with no armour, and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• weapons, and will be placed against enemies that could 1v1 you and win without breaking a sweat.   Even Dark Souls gives you an easier time starting off than this, trust me.  I recommend playing an Origin character before playing as custom, to get your first experience with a unique character, as the different characters have their own personal questlines and dialogue, which is interesting.  Combat is amazing as ever, however the initiative system has changed from the first one, instead whoever simply has the highest will start (or if it's a scripted boss/enemy to go first), then it will alternate between friend/foe/friend/foe.  Magic Armour and Physical Armour are interesting and basically grants you guranteed immuntie to certain status effects, like Stunned, Knocked down and bleeding unless said armour is reduced to 0. has it's drawback as it means if you dont have the perserverence attribute levelled some you'll get stunlocked in unfortunate positions by mages.  Lots of gametime for the story, with even double if you don't skip all the dialogue and pay attention to side quests (which I didn't).  overall 9/10 some bugs, but overall game is fantastic with a great story."

dep,81,2,0,August 29,Recommended,192.0,"Pros: Great look about the game, an old school isometric style but fully realised in 3D. The amount of detail is crazy, the main maps are large and crammed with objects and details. The sound is excellent and immersive, I‚Äôd guess 95% of dialogue is voiced, the soundtrack is good and sits well in the background. The gameplay is excellent once you know how to play (see cons) and really lets you go wild with combos between your party, using and abusing the environment, and manipulating your enemies. There is a huge variety of ways to play your characters, all without rigid roles or classes, allowing you create something like a Death Knight from warrior and necromancer skills, or Ranger with bow skills and summoning skills. A massive amount of mods to make the game easier or harder or just different. Cons: There is a very steep learning curve. If you don't know, and I mean really know, what you are doing the game can seem like it's just out to annoy you. It's not (mostly), but because of the nature of the combat system the game can swing between impossible and barely a challenge without too much middle ground. The levels can be quite arbitrary in where you can go. The second island for example ranges between level 9 and 15, and you can quite easily wonder into a fight you just have no chance of winning at that time. As the game does it‚Äôs best not to hold your hand, don‚Äôt expect much help from the quests. The massive array of options in playing your character also gives you many more ways to mess up. It might seem like a good idea to make a necromancer tank but you won‚Äôt do enough damage to heal yourself enough, better off going full offensive. If you don‚Äôt mind learning the hard way, not just reloading but restarting after you‚Äôve wasted all your money on spells that don‚Äôt work together, then you will love this RPG. Otherwise at least get a guide for character creation and have some fun. "

Kipacus,31,2,0,"November 12, 2017",Recommended,98.2,This game gave me and my friends that old school Dungeon and Dragons Feel.  It gave me about 55 hours of gameplay if you take your time and enjoy the side quests and all of the content the creators added for you.  Clearly they listened to what the people wanted and gave it to us.  You have the freedom to build the charactor how ever you want.  I can not reccomend this game enough.  The game had a major bug when I first bought it thats now resolved (If you were player 2 and a summoner your spells would vanish and your summon wouldnt have their abilities only auto attack).  But like I said that was already resolved.  The game in its current state I give a 9/10.

Magus,267,2,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,236.5,"The game is awesome. The roleplaying opportunities are endless. A skeleton playthrough on tactician is not recommended for you first run. People attack the undead for some reason, don't know why. The origin characters are well written and makes the story more personal, especially seeing as you can decide to play the character however you wish.   Protip: Don't install mods until the game is ""finished"", steam forces you to update the game so that is likely to break mods. If that is a concern you might want to get the game on GoG instead for the control it offers."

Graphic (despite the clunky character potraits) and sound are excellent and detailled.   Future rpgs have let themselves to be measured on what Larian Studios achieved here.   The last ~50% of the game (act3-5) sure seem a bit rushed. The magic of the first 2 acts is not entirely gone but fades until the game becomes from time to time slightly annoying in act 5.   Still one of the best ""classical"" rpgs I ever played.   And please change the either groupwide magic dmg or physical dmg concept. On higher difficulties it makes no sense to go with a mixed group.

Gary Ginderhal,188,2,0,"May 14, 2017",Recommended,71.8,"Fantastic gameplay, even in an alpha state. That's the short of it, the long of it is a little more complicated.  This game's got a lot to offer even in an extremely unfinished state as it is, and I'll probably change my review when the next story segment comes out and likely again when the game's released as a finished product. As it stands, without voices, with missing dialogue, with missing assets, and occasional bugs, this is still a beautiful game that, while short, offers some pretty in-depth character customization, even up to level 8 or 9.   The elemental effect/terrain altering magic from the first game is back, and better than ever, with a few new combinations, as well as the Bless/Curse quasi-elements that can transform an already dangerous fire patch into a lethal Cursed Flame that sets enemies or allies aflame with immolation that can't be put out with water, or transform an annoying but avoidable oil patch into Blessed Oil that fortifies allies instead of slowing them, making it a detour you WANT to walk through for a buff rather than a hindrance to walk around. I constantly found myself wondering how best to use my action points to turn terrain to my advantage rather than simply cluttering up the field with dangerous patches of fire, ooze, or electrified water.  Creating characters is even more in-depth than the last game, and many of the old skills from the first game have either been changed or removed for more interesting ones. Summoning is now its own skill tree, and is best paired with spells that create environmental effects, or simply on a Lizard who can breathe a patch of flame wherever they want, as the summons, a totem and an ""Incarnate"" gain the element they're conjured on, either water, fire, poison, oil, or blood. Even with all the spells at my disposal, I still found myself favoring the weapons I'd chosen before, as even with a hundred spells at my disposal, sometimes it's nice to just smack someone with a big sword.  This game can be very, VERY hard, but often in a Dark Souls way. Usually you'll know why you died, and can reload to try to fix it next time. Enemy casting a lot of fire spells? Make sure to purchase a rain scroll or use more water magic to counteract them, or simply stunlock the enemy to death and try to pick apart the enemy's strategy. It's pretty rare that you'll encounter a fight that you simply cannot win when you first encounter it, unless you go into the battle extremely underleveled (If you're more than 1 level below your opponent, you're probably going to lose). Generally fights last a while, so make sure to prepare for both long and short combats as it's rare that you'll go into a fight completely outclassing your opponent, and be prepared to burn potions and the like, as they WILL give you an edge in combat and it's generally not worth trying to tough it out without them. There's apparently an entire mechanic for food, but I've never gotten good results from it and the buffs generally arent worth the action points it takes to eat it, so you can't simply down six cheese wheels to heal to full.  The storyline's not quite as good as the gameplay, sadly, but I'm pretty confident that with voice acting and some tweaks it will get far stronger. The quest journal's still hardly worth looking at unless you've totally forgotten what you've done and feel like looking through a complicated and user-unfriendly transcript of everyone you've ever spoken to. The journal could definitely use a change as it was often hard to maintain who's quests were what and with four characters with FOUR SEPARATE JOURNALS THAT OFTEN HAVE SEPARATE QUESTS it's quite difficult to keep everything straight. Thankfully it's easy to just start walking in a direction and you'll probably run into some enemies that are either your level or much, much higher, leading to a quick-reload and a different path taken. The storyline itself introduces a number of people, Dalis the Hammer, Bishop Alexandar, a blind elven seer, and far, far, FAR more, each with a complex backstory that almost everyone's happy to narrate to you at the drop of a hat, which can get a little overwhelming sometimes, but it's an inherently wordy RPG, so that's just par for the course.  The story's tone is classic Larian, with a serious and epic plot that tries to be grim and po-faced when the rest of the world is made up of goofy talking skulls, riddling rats, mad witches, puns, and adorable dog quest-givers. Although the main storyline ends up looking a little out-of-place, it's nice that it's there and that the game's not simply a permanent comedy routine. I will say that some will find the tone kind of schizophrenic, and although I'd agree with that I'd also say that it's not a game to be taken seriously, and is instead more a sandbox for one or more players can wreak havoc or play within the rules.  Character customization is a little lacking at the moment, but that's almost secondary compared to the great animations each race/gender has, as well as each armor set looking different on each race, with an emphasis on eastern cloth for Lizards, or a hardier iron look for Dwarves. Spells have intricate and impressive effects, even for basic spells such as ""Throw a rock"" or ""hit someone extra hard."" While the hairdos and facial options presented to each race and gender is pretty small, it's generally enough that you probably won't get your characters confused.  On an entirely different note, the game's graphics and representation is amazing. I love the vibrant colors, and beautiful tropical locale for the start of the game. The one big downside is that the first part of the game takes place in a giant prison, but the atmosphere is that of a tropical resort, with sunny skies, beautiful coral beaches, and a shanty-town that looks more like a run-down tourist town than a brutal gulag for wizards. Although it wouldn't be nearly as pretty to look at, it would have been nice to have a more oppressive environment to start in, and escape to the tropical paradise later on, for contrast. That being said, the shadow effects playing off trees and logs, and the drop dead gorgeous beaches make for an impressive opening, and when the future chapters of the game are released, I'll be most excited to see the environments they take place in.  To sum it all up, this game is ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing fantastic. Worth a look if you enjoy slower-paced RPGs, even though the storyline's only about 1/3rd complete. With almost all of its flaws coming from being an unfinished alpha and very few coming from the actual design or gameplay. Pretty much fun in every aspect, with an insane level of combat and character customization depth, this game is absolutely worth your time."

I've got to say that this game is one of the best for its price range, there's so much content in this game its crazy and its all voice acted :DD. Larian studio's really out did themselves with this game, if I had completed every single possible side quest/content before the main story finishes we are looking into 150hours plus (on honour mode which I play) or 100 hours plus on any other difficulty whilst reading dialogue etc.. This game is best played with friends as the character interactions/dialogue is top notch and provide really fun role playing. However I played by myself as I wanted to get immersed and finish the game on the hardest difficulty due feelings of it being rushed if I played with more people.   it took me 52 hours to complete the game doing story mission only with 1 origin character story (Lohse completed) as well as critical side quests that are blocking my way to the main quest. I'm also playing on Honour Mode difficulty(if your whole party dies you save is wiped), basically I have to play very safe ( I died quarter way in the game, salty af).   This game is worth every penny and its price tag just beats some of AAA games on global top sellers on steam for content/replayability to price ratio.

Pros   The Characters and Dialoge are of course very good, with all of the origin characters having interesting backgrounds. your choices are questioned by your party memebers and many of them have different veiws, as they should.  The Skills and combos are fantastic and really fun to use although you will need to remember that your combos can be exploited or even used agaisnt you by the enemy Ai.  Armor and weapons look great and there seems to be a wide variety of different skins for each type of weapon.  While i did not explore the crafting system as much as i should have its pretty much the same as the last game. Although there are supposed to be way more (items etc) that we can craft.  The sound affects and the soundtrack are just as catchy and cool as last time. (GIVE ME THE SOUNDTRACK)  Cons.   Some enemy types have almost unfair adavantages against a party of any compsition, namley the undead and or necromancers/witches. Undead/ dark magic users, can both heal from poison and blood, as well as regular healing spells, which really just makes the battle alot longer than it needs to be. Ive never been a fan of undead being able to use the Hydro Healing spells. They should benfit from blood/poison fields/ spells only.  The Ui Still needs a bit of improvement as the item management system is still not that great. But is ok. It is very simplistic/minimalistic which is fine but we will need access to a universal chest of some sort to store our materials and such in. Or multiple backpacks will need to be equipped to carry most of your loot /items. Rather than turning one character into a pack mule or having lots of items spread out around multiple characters.      "

Ananoriel,336,2,0,"November 10, 2017",Recommended,76.9,"After 77 hours I finished Divinity Original Sin 2, and it was a blast! Most modern games don't grab my attention that long anymore, but this is one of the few that really keeps on being interesting and enjoyable.   Divinity OS 2 is a cartoonylooking RPG with turnbased elements. You have a big world to explore with your main character and 3 companions. You can build your characters in any way you want, with different talents, skills and stats. And it is fun to try out different party compositions. I ended up with having one ranger, one necromancer/scoundrel, one mage and one polymorph fighter. And there are many other ways to build your party, fitting to your playstyle.  The combat is the thing the game is most appraised about. It is turn based, and you can manipulate the battleground with surfaces from skills or items. And combining them in more powerful effects. For example you can throw oil on the floor to set it on fire. Or you can let it rain, and freeze enemies to death! It has many options and the combat has because of this many different outcomes, multiple techniques are possible. If you find the combat too easy or too hard, you can change the difficulty as well. I played most time on Classic mode, I found that the best balance for me to enjoy the game.  Another good thing about the game is the story, and the quests. You can get quests by talking to NPCs or exploring, and those are stored in your journal. You won't get exact questpointers, but with a little story that enfolds when you do more talking, exploring or fighting. For some people that would be a downside, but I really miss that in games, that you have to play the game more to find it out instead of running to a pointer and doing what is needed. The story is filled with intriguing characters, a nice pace and many plottwists to keep you awake. The NPCs make the gameworld interesting and feel alive. You can in some situations persuade them with skillchecks, and what you say to them may have an influence on how much they will help you or perhaps make your day bad if you fail. I feel like the humor in this game is a lot more subtle and less forced than in the first Original Sin game. It makes me feel to explore the world more and talk to NPCs. And the best thing: EVERYTHING IS FULLY VOICED! Which makes the game feel so finished.  Even that the artstyle is more cartoony, it is still beautiful in it's way. It doesn't look cheap or outdated, and there are many beautiful environments to adventure in. The music is good as well, I didn't feel bored by it. And you can change the main instrument of the battle songs of the characters you are playing, which is a nice detail. Other positive points on the game are: The Multiplayer mode, you can play an own campaign with your friends, or you can enjoy the main storyline too. This is a fun addition, and you can make it even more interesting with mods from the Workshop. The crafting system is unmissable from RPGs as well, and it is in this game as well. You can use almost everything you find to make armour, potions, arrows, grenades, whatsoever by combining them. This is fun to do, but I do recommend to find and use recipes since there are so many options.   So there is a lot of praise from me as well. But are there any downsides? Well, one thing that bothered me quite a bit was that there were plenty of bugs (some even gamebreaking) in the game. They have fixed many at the start of the release, but the further you get in the game, the more bugs and glitches you will find. That is a shame because this game is so wonderful, and has so much potential.  Do I recommend this game? Yes I definitely do! It has been a while since a game has been so enjoyable during the full playthrough and it feels like a worthy revival of the old partybased rpgs.  My rating for this game: 9/10."

So I knew they had talent but, bizarrely, they've spent the last 15 years making very average games (with the first Original Sin being a possible exception).  But this is something else. They've nailed it. It feels like they've finally made the game they wanted to make all those years ago.  It's hard to list everything good about it, but the writing, the voice acting, the world building, the character development, the questing structure, the combat... it's all so effortlessly brilliant.   It makes other genre greats like Pillars of Eternity look extremely average. And, if it isn't already, I can see it becoming one of my favourite RPGs ever. "

Guru,337,2,0,April 18,Recommended,81.3,"This is a fantastic RPG. You don't need another review praising it; it has enough of that already. So instead I'm going to discuss a few of its truly major flaws.  The game's design conflicts with its storytelling. I believe the devs wanted to craft something with an 'old school' feeling of challenge, but they lacked the talent to find a way to accomplish this outside of ""give the enemy unfair advantages"". For example, the game really only has one trick up it's sleeve: the ambush. Do you enjoy having your party jumped by overwhelming numbers of difficult bad guys that weren't there a moment ago, and giving them the first turn? You better, because it's how every fight is going down. Every single one.  Sometimes, rarely, YOU get to ambush the enemy... but they sometimes still get the first turn. Why? F you, that's why.  Frequently, bosses and encounters are made difficult not through clever design or tactical necessity, but through raw brute force and numerical disadvantage. It's no fun drowning under misaligned action economy, and thus a lot of the game's most important fights are left feeling like a chore, rather than an exhilerating battle. Immersion dies a gurgling death as you're forced to reload time and again, or skip dialogue scenes because initiating dialogue robs you of a precious initiative you totally lose, otherwise. Your character is made out to be the most pathetic of rubes, bamboozeled and ambushed and jumped again and again and again, never aware of the trap that's sprung on them, even after it's been sprung 500 times or more.   Hell, sometimes, in an effort to get the drop on someone else, you'll use a skill, which will execute the battle sequence, but the skill won't ""count"", leaving you ad a disadvantage and wityh a skill on cooldown that never fired off. Shoddy.  The storytelling, characters, and presentation of this game are truly S-class, but the nuts and bolts of the design betray the dev team's inexperience. Somewhere in the mix of all the dazzling setpieces and clever dialogue and rich world design, they forgot to make the battles fun. They didn't have the time or inspiration to make the battles feel different from each other; instead, it's just a long slog of you're ambushed, you're ambushed, you're ambushed, you're ambushed...  I still reccommend this game, but if you're reading these reviews and wondering what you're walking into, I still say buyer beware. If you're the type of gamer that likes to save-scam and find cheesy strats to win fights, this is the game for you. If you enjoy a varied experience of battles and well-paced content, perhaps look elsewhere. This game is a vast improvement on the original, but it still feels as though the dev team came very close to what might have been the best RPG of all time, merely making one that is 'well above average'. A silver medal glitters just fine, but I think we would all hope for the gold next time."
Mr Engineer,77,2,0,October 30,Recommended,135.4,"Finally finished the game, so let's review:  Pros: Very in-depth RPG, there are a lot of opportunities to personalize your character and play style. Tactical turn based combat. Loads of interesting quests packed with different ways to complete them. Four player co-op! Even though my experience was exactly as chaotic as you may expect. Adding to the above point, you can do almost anything and fight anyone without breaking the game! Cons: Some bugs will make you wish you saved more often (ex. characters frozen in dialogue, armor buffs not applying anymore). Players can sometimes progress quests, even origin character personal quests or big story shifting moments, without input from other players. Were you the first guy in the room? Well, hope you have high persuasion and/or need to talk to the NPCs because your pals are out of luck! Decide for yourself: 80-100 hours of content for one playthrough! Most of the RNG elements from DOS1 have been stripped away for a more straight forward, if not always more rewarding, experience (ex. armor system to resist cc, character tags open up new dialogue options but don't provide any combat/civil buffs). Combat cheese, or abusing the system... I haven't encountered an impossible fight yet, but there are plenty that can be made a lot easier by adding some deathfog barrels, applying buffs while in dialogue before the fight, fleeing with one character to get full health before returning to the fight, etc. Ending spoiler  No matter how you played before, unless you swear to the god king or demon, you can choose any ending you want Mass Effect 3 style.  Overall, I would completely recommend this game. I even started another playthrough!"

queue for comp with me pls,229,27,8,"December 15, 2017",Recommended,74.8,"It's difficult to give this game either a straight thumbs up or thumbs down, since there's both good and bad about it. I ended up giving it a thumbs up because I still think it's worth playing even if it has some problems. Note that I'm a nerd when it comes to games, so there's a few technical bullet points that probably won't matter at all to most people.  The good:  Fantastic music  Strong story (at least until the end)  Turn-based combat was usually enjoyable, even if you're not the kind of person who usually enjoys it  Well-optimized (max settings @ 2560x1440, usually 2560x1440 60fps on Ryzen 5 1600X, GTX 970, 16GB ram)  Detailed graphical settings menu  Hardware mouse cursor  Ability to quicksave in the middle of dialogue, letting you explore all possible options The bad:  Probably my biggest gripe with the game is that it's split up into 4 islands, each with their own group of quests. Once you decide to progress to the next area, there's no way to go back to the previous area if you wanted to complete some unfinished quests later (besides loading up an older save, of course). You are very clearly warned that you won't be able to go back, I just have an issue with the design choice itself.   Quests can be pretty easily broken by doing them ""out of order"", without automatically skipping ahead or marking a quest as ""failed"" (kill a guy for quest A before you progressed enough in quest B where you were supposed to talk to him). There's no way to know the ""order"" to do quests in without looking on the wiki. Sometimes doing quests out of order resulted in the quest journal entry for them being completely blank.   Almost all quests create markers on the map, but they are usually left behind even after the quest is complete, or don't update along with quest progress. This leads to a world map that is full of markers, most of which are meaningless. Compounding this issue, there's no way to set an ""active"" quest (unless you count marking all but one quest inactive, kinda tedious).   A lot of quests (~35%) have non-obvious solutions or locations to visit that required me to look on the wiki for help (remember, unhelpful quest markers).   A significant number of quests (10-20%) don't actually get marked as ""complete"" when you finish them, which means they'll just stay in your journal as active quests   I'm usually not a fan of strategy/turn-based games. I admit to playing this game on the easiest difficulty and still finding it somewhat challenging. With that said, maybe I'm just an idiot, but I found some mechanics that were part of this game's combat to be extremely irritating, most notably the turn-skipping mechanics. If you ever let your characters lose all their magic armor, expect to have them focused hard by the AI. You'll likely have at least 2 of your characters' turns skipped per round. One particular fight I had ended with me watching my characters getting repeatedly frozen for several rounds, where all I could do was watch. Pretty frustrating.   In the same vein as the above bullet point, don't try to control the battlefield, or put out that fire you're standing in. It's completely irrelevant. Just focus on killing everyone first, then heal up your characters. If you waste time and action points blessing that cursed surface, the first thing an AI will do is curse it again.   Meh ending (subjectively)   Perhaps not technically a problem with the game itself, but Steam cloud chokes hard on this game. Sometimes quicksaves are all right, but other times it'll completely freeze the game for 30 seconds while Steam is doing god-knows-what. My fix was disabling Steam cloud and just having saves back up to OneDrive (the game saves to your documents folder). The irritating: (Things that weren't really problems with the game, just unpolished things that need a bit more love)  Using the mouse to rotate the camera by holding MOUSE3 is extremely stuttery and is relative only, so it will ""slip"" and won't rotate very far if you move your mouse quickly   Completed quests are marked as ""closed"" and are removed from the active quest list when you look at them one last time to read the ""i finished this quest"" flavor text. However, sometimes you will open the quest journal and the finished quest is already selected, and it'll show the ""i finished this quest"" flavor text for 1 frame before moving it to the archived quests section. I wanted to read that!   Book page turning effects are significantly misaligned It's a solid game with an intriguing story that's definitely worth playing, but it's a far cry from the best RPG ever. Skyrim did it better."

Cool thing is they are basically forcing certain race/sex on you (they have a lizard guy as a playable) to give your character a deeper back story for dialogue options.  Don't worry you can still customize their face/class etc.  Audio effects seem a little off, and the music is so far subpar compared to the original.  All of these things I expect to see be resolved in the next few months as the game becomes more polished and lives up to its predicessor.  Also on the beach there is a statue of Braccus Rex, which is pretty cool for emerssion.  Buy this game if you want to support the devs (which I do).  Waiting to give it a full or first act playthrough once they dialogue is more full rather than the way it is sort of asterisked as actionable atm, which is hard to read and play and get into imo.

Find out it's a setup for cash, all friends belongings have been taken and a group of bandits start to fight him alone in the locked room while the Lizard runs off.

If you have not played the first, buy it before you buy this one.  Anyway, I will not go into the virtues of this game, but instead Ill go into some negatives.  I would give this game a thumbs down, except for the play time and fun I had.  There are just some major flaws with the game and I wish the developers would really address them.  Gripes: The UI is pretty bad.  The quest log is a mess and the inventory is worse.  Even a key chain would do wonders.  It would be really nice if any charater could bater and just use the highest batering of any character instead of forcing you to give everything to one character.  The same with other skills in other situations.  IE: Initatiting dialog with a character that doesn't have any persuasion skill.  The quests are down right mysterious in a lot of cases.  I frequently have to google on what to do on quests.  This is a bit too old school for me.   Also important information was frequently missing from the quest log and I had to either write it down or google it.  Things like the 7 gods sun/moon alignments are... or god X favoers earth and god y favors water,  and stuff like that.  I would like less puzzly quests and/or better hints.  ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t combats:  Most speical encounters involve the enemies getting a whole bunch of actions before you get any. As you get later in the game, the level of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t rises higher and higher.  The final battle is a whole new level of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t beyond anything you have encountered before.  Hint to the devs:  This kind of thing is not fun.  You really should have play tested the full game.  While bugs are one thing, balance is definitly something you messed up big time.  Don't even get me started on your respawning revrents.  Still though, this game is worth the money even though it has some serious flaws.  Please excuse the bad spelling and typoes. Its a bit late and I have had a considerable amount of wine.

The RPG elements are top notch and the combat feels very strategic and satisfying. THIS GAME IS DIFFICULT HOWEVER! Don't jump in expecting to just mow through it.

Gilded,0,3,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,71.9,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a phenomenal experience anyone who is a classic RPG fan will love.   The overall appeal of Larian studios masterpiece is in its complex RPG systems, dynamic combat and world-changing character choices that synergize together to create an unforgettable experience. There is a ton of replayability because the world dynamically adapts to the choices you make. From the missions you decide to do or not, to the fights you start for no reason, this game really is yours to play however you would like.  They also have great controller support, a fantastic crafting system, a truely unique multiplayer experiance, complex weapon and armor mechanics and a wide range of skills and abilities to choose from. Not to mention the increasing number of mods already available from the community.  There are some downsides, like the inability to re-specialize early on (already fixed by mods) and the overall difficulty seems to be a little unbalanced. Every fight is difficult, requiring you to really think before you act.  Overall I would give Divinity: Original Sin 2 an 8.5 out of 10.

One friend decides to have sexy time with a Lizard at the inn, pays 100 gold for the privilege. Lizard tells everyone else to leave as they have very detailed hardcore intercourse.  Find out it's a setup for cash, all friends belongings have been taken and a group of bandits start to fight him alone in the locked room while the Lizard runs off. I pyramid my butt right in to the fight and we beat them all up.   Angry at the Lizard I say we should kill him. Friend decides against it and proceeds to ask the lizard if he's up for another go in the sack.  10/10 - Best Romantic Game of 2017"
Happy Colored Marbles,256,3,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,32.0,"If you like RPGs at all I think you owe it to yourself to play this game. The world is filled with story and lore, lots of hidden things to keep you entertained. Plenty of fun and unique dialog that you'll find yourself wanting to experience and not just skip. In some ways the open ended nature of the game and the fact that it's totally willing to let you kill yourself as many times as it takes to teach you something reminds me of D&D. You're given tools and problems and set free to solve them and move through the story organically. The combat is turn based, deep and tactical.    You'll find yourself creating strategic synergies with your team and relish the creative ways you can defeat your enemies (funny deaths with teleport alone could keep me occupied for hours).  That said the game will punish you if you rush in with reckless abandon rather than carefull engaging. I recommend saving often :)  The game is a blast co-op if you don't mind waiting for your friends to take their turns, controller support is top notch, the  graphics are beautiful but not at all taxing for mid grade machines. This is a game crafted with a lot of care and polish and it deserves your time."

AlienSpectator,190,3,1,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,76.1,"A true piece of art, the best RPG I've played since Dragon Age: Origins.  I didn't play this game much yet, but I've been following its development, as I did for D:OS1. You've got everything you'd want from an RPG: good story, interesting universe and characters, tactical (and even one of the best I've seen!) combat system - varied skills to use and a lot of combos between different characters - true replayability. And fun multiplayer (even if I'd advise to play only with friends you can trust).  So I'm only going to focus on what you may actually not like much:  Set up. There's a lot of dialogues - they are rather good, and they are voiced. But there are many of them: if you're not too much into that, you'll miss a quarter of what the game has to offer, at least.     The game has a thing for silly stuff. Like in the previous opus, dialogues are very ""facetious"". It's a mix of jokes and serious stuff, you have to be prepared for absurd deaths and brutals happenings, but if you can't handle anything else than fashionable so-called ""dark fantasy"" you'll be disappointed. D:OS2 is colourful, baroque and lively, and also features cannibals and living deads, even if you can create ugly meat ball that explode on your enemies (and friends alike, thanks to friendly fire).     Character building. In DOS2, it's not a straightforward process. Sure, you can pick all deafult options and you shouldn't have too many problems - but if you don't enjoy doing things like selecting skills that go well together and/orcrafting, you'll also miss a good part of the game. It's not just about choice between different ""specialities"", it's really about elaborating strategies and enjoying battle plans. If you're ok with all this, you're likely to enjoy this game. You'll also need a lot of time, obviously, but the ""quest log"" is sufficiently well done to not lose you if you can't play a lot, and you don't need a lot of time to learn the game (everything is pretty intuitive, you don't need to spend hours on a wiki to know what does what or why you can't do X).   Would kickstart again."

GeoTrooper13,224,3,0,"October 8, 2017",Recommended,97.1," TLDR:  Put 100 hours into one playthrough.  A phenomenal RPG experience that is a breath of fresh air.  Even at full price this game is well worth it.  Some pros, neutrals and cons for some quick pointers.  My views and such will be included after but can be ignored if wished.   Pros: Only $45 which is a steal for the amount of content you get. Very lengthy game, 4 world areas with multiple quests in each of them. Servicable story, interesting but nothing mind blowing, same goes for the lore. Lots of side quests to do which can put you in some interesting situations. Very well written characters, this goes for followers and NPCs. Lots of dialogue and options for you to navigate conversations, and every line is voiced too! Very good, tactical, challenging combat.  Lots of ways to approach each encounter. Diversity in how to play characters.  No defined ""roles"" and its easy to completely change a character at any point after the first main area. The entire game is playable in co-op which can be drop in drop out.  Works with up to 4 players.  It even has split screen! Also comes with an Arena multiplayer mode for PvP and a Game Master mode to play D&D with friends.  Basically infinte replayability. Along with that as a bonus they included the Engine for Divinity as a free download.  You can make your own mods, maps, scripted dialogue, etc.  It even has native workshop support to easily upload to. Steam workshop support for easy access to mods.  Neutral: These neutral comments are going to be mostly preferencial for people.  Not a problem for me but I can see how it can be a problem for others. No handholding whatsoever.  Not really an issue for me and some may wonder why this here.  For some I can see an issue with some quests.  There were a few times where I wondered how the game thought I would have been able to figure out certain things.  If you get stuck just have the wiki open, I certainly used it a few times and it was very helpful. No handholding also extends to combat.  Combat can be really challenging at times, almost borderline unfair.  However once you learn all the mechanics of the game and learn how to be scummy it is really satisfying to beat a challenging fight. In my opinion there were a few quests that were poorly designed.  Kinda goes with the point of no handholding, a few of the ways to complete some quests were really convoluted.  Not that many of them which is why it's neutral and not a con.  Cons: Bugs, lots of them.  There are many quest bugs in this game which cause quests not to close out properly.  In my experience I would say there were around maybe 15 or so in total.  Kind of annoying when you fail a quest just because it gets bugged out.  Also the recorded dialogue cuts out randomly some times.  However Larian have been releasing patches so hopefully most of the bugs will all be ironed out eventually. Overall this game was phenomenal, loved almost all of my time with it.  At $45 which gave me about 100 hours on a single playthrough it was absolutely worth the money.  I was surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did since I don't really enjoy isometric RPGs with this kind of combat.  I tried Pillar's of Eternity and could never finish it.  Really it's the combat that prevents me from playing games like this.  However Divinity's combat is extremely well done and I enjoyed it when I learned the in's and out's.  This game is certainly not for everyone, for those that don't like challenging, slow, turn based combat this isn't for you.  If you don't like long winded, role-play driven, lore heavy dialogue and questing this game isn't for you.  If you don't like a lack of handholding in your quests this game isn't for you.  If you like all of the above or are looking for an amazing RPG that says ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• all to modern tropes then I can say with certainty you'll enjoy Divinity: Original Sin 2.  Honestly at full price this game is worth it, on sale it's a must buy.  Hopefully more people will continue to buy this game and support Larian, they fully deserve it and I can't wait to see what they'll do next."

DarthDavy,293,3,5,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,129.7,"Disclaimer: the following text is totally unbiased and non sarcastic!  I have some gripes with the monetization of this game. It's clear that Larian hasn't enterend the realm of 2017 yet and DOS2 is really not up to par with todays standards: 1. DOS2 retails for 44.99US$ or your regional equivalent. A modern game with high production values, which DOS2 clearly has with its beautiful atmospheric graphics, its incredible well written story, an amazing voice acting performance, a grandiose orchestral soundtrack, dozens hours of content and deep tactical gameplay should retail for 59.99US$. 2. No pre order bonus. In the beginning of the game you meet a black cat with its own small storyline, but totally not essential to the grand story overall. DOS2 has tons of sidequests with their own story and those go further than the bland ""go fetch me 10 wolf pelts"" sidequests. Those sidequests make the game so much more engaging and rewarding to play. That black cat could be easily cut from the game and offered as a pre order bonus, which would be a good incentive for people to buy the game upfront without knowing if the game is any good. After launch you offer the black cat as a 9.99US$ DLC and make some more money out of it. 3. DOS2 comes with 6 origin stories, 6 unique characters, which greatly changes how you will experience your travels and adventures throughout Rivellon. This enhances the replayability of DOS2, but knowing this game is in one playthrough already al least 70 hours long this is perhaps a bit much to offer at a base price of 44.99US$, which really should be 59.99US$ (see point 1.). As you can take only 4 characters in your party, offering 4 origin stories in the base game is more than enough. You can easily cut two, say Beast (a Dwarven Pirate) and Fane (an Undead), and offer them in a Digital Deluxe Special Edition for an extra 20$: - Divinity Original Sin 2: Pirate Edition for 79.99US$ with Beast origin story - Divinity Original Sin 2: Undead Edition for 79.99US$ with Fane origin story And of course you bundle this all together in: - Divinity Original Sin 2: Gold Edition for 99.99US$ with all 6 origin stories 4. DOS2 doesn't have a season pass. Will Larian just patch and add extra content for free? 5. DOS2 makes you play and enjoy the game without cutting corners through microtransactions. If a character in your party dies, you must make sure you have a resurrection scroll to revive him/her or have enough gold to buy one from the NPC's in the game. There is no ingame store that let you buy ingame items or ingame gold for real money.  Despite these 5 points of criticism DOS2 is a fantastic game. It's one of the best cRPG's ever made and playing this game you feel you're playing something special. This truly is a classic: 10/10!"

Gilded,685,3,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,71.9,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a phenomenal experience anyone who is a classic RPG fan will love.   The overall appeal of Larian studios masterpiece is in its complex RPG systems, dynamic combat and world-changing character choices that synergize together to create an unforgettable experience. There is a ton of replayability because the world dynamically adapts to the choices you make. From the missions you decide to do or not, to the fights you start for no reason, this game really is yours to play however you would like.  They also have great controller support, a fantastic crafting system, a truely unique multiplayer experiance, complex weapon and armor mechanics and a wide range of skills and abilities to choose from. Not to mention the increasing number of mods already available from the community.  There are some downsides, like the inability to re-specialize early on (already fixed by mods) and the overall difficulty seems to be a little unbalanced.

Lohkar3,120,3,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,246.5,"Gamer's game Most games these days are over after playing it ~30 hours, I was positively suprised that it was only the end of 1st act in the game and 2nd act seems to unfold even more content to explore and to beat.   The game has this bit of a typical rough beginning, where you are a prisoner and have to start working your way into freedom. I'm not sure does it help to introduce the gaming mechanics that well, since some of the first obstacles in the game require already hard exploration or knowledge of your surroundings. But I won't go too much into the game's internal story settings and themes on this one. Instead I'll just give quick look for those who are interested in the game, but find it hard to get started.  If you are a casual rpg player, this game is best to start in co-op with your friend on medium difficulty. The game is playable/enjoyable initially in single player as well, but you'll have to get used to manage alot with the inventory, skills and spells early on. One of the aspects that makes many lose the interest to these kinda games when playing alone. But those few well written NPC friends makes sure you'll get a feeling of unity and comradeship while you progress in the story. The game has also this welcoming feeling to those who haven't played the first game, without referencing it too much.  Combat is turn-based and it isn't around every corner, but when you find it though, it usually lasts slightly longer than in many other games. I remember one ambush encounter in a forest section took like 15 minutes active fighting, and that was after we came back to it with better equiptment. Dialogues and random banters are high also in this game, which all seems to be voice acted from the ""AI's"" side to give more lively touch to it. And you can example easily play 2 hours and all you did was few conversations.  The game also offers eventually challenge for more hardcore players, who would get bored if the game would be too easy. Hardest difficulty (Tactician) requires quite alot backtracking and unconventional tactics sometimes to overcome encounters with the builds you might have at disposal. And eventually if you're feeling confident enough you can try the real hardcore mode (Honour) where losing all your characters ends the game and removes your single save file.  I'll try to overlook some of the negative sides in overall since some can be patched later and some are build so deep in the game mechanics it is more of a ""depatable"" thing. Like personally I would like magic to be more meaningful and more costly to the caster, so it doesn't become a norm in the world for elements to go chaotic in every fight. But I guess it's something you can expect in a Divinity's world.  Nontheless this game is true to the older adventure/fantasy/rpg games, where you'll get minimal hand helding and have to figure things out by yourself. No-one is master in the beginning, but everyone can learn to fare better. Some events can be solved with pure violence or with smooth talking, the choice is often yours.  -Even if you'll never finish this game, it is worth a try.   9/10"

Stormfrenzy88,9,3,0,October 8,Recommended,113.6,This game is the ultimate cRPG. You can just feel the passion and dedication that has been put into this game. It‚Äôs the only one that actually innovates the genre while others are still stuck redoing the 90s. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I used to love these games back in the day but 2D worlds and antiquated combat systems of infinity style games just feel dated by now and D:OS 2 really improves upon these main shortcoming of the genre.  The main strength of the game lies within its fantastic combat system. Turn-based is the absolute best fit for party based combat that allows for incredible depth. For every encounter there are multiple approaches to consider and the way abilities interact between each other and the environment is just awesome.  Another great thing about the game is how much player freedom it allows. A lot of quests have many different ways to solve them with various outcomes. Not reaching an ideal outcome in a quest will not hinder your progress but the story will just play out differently.   The visual and sound design is truly top notch and does a great job of getting you immersed in the game world. The fully 3D world with rotatable camera is a treat to explore.  It is designed with gameplay first approach and I absolutely love it but that said the story and characters are still fairly interesting and open up a plethora of moral questions that do not always have a clear cut right or wrong answer.   The game‚Äôs lack of hand-holding and signposting mostly feels like a breath of fresh air but can get a bit frustrating at times. Of course that‚Äôs only because the tendency in recent games to overdo it has conditioned us to think less for ourselves so overall I find the direction here to be positive.  The amount of content this game offers is certainly impressive and well worth the cost.  Overall I‚Äôd say that while there certainly is room for improvements Larian has done a good job making this masterpiece that has found a place among my most beloved games of all time. Therefore I would rate this game with a nearly perfect score of 9.5/10.

nakimesis-,148,3,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,135.3,"Game that tops the oh so beloved by world Witcher 3, hands down. I've been planing on postponing writing this review to the moment when I complete the game whole, but after realizing I got a pretty strong grasp on it, I figured there's no point in waiting and the time has come to add my own brick to the game pras wall.  If you feel disappointed by RPG games praised by the reviewers and gaming community lately (namely The Witcher 3 or latest Fallout installment) you should give this game a go - with captivating story, interesting characters, dynamic and tactical combat, and character development that actually feels rewarding and meaningful it reaches out for the title of turn-based RPG game of the dacade.  I've bought the game on official release, not having played the early access before, only the predecessor. And I got immediately sank in the world of Rivellon - realizing that I pumped as much as 40 hours in marely 10 days.  Thanks to the compelling gameplay, you get sticked to the screen, not wanting to leave - promising yourself every half an hour, that you only gonna get that last quest completed, that last cave explored, that last bad guy butchered. There aren't any meaningless quotation marks on your maps, which give you mundane quests of the ""here's the key, use it to open that chest 10 meters from you, to get your dull loot"" likes (*cough* I'm lookin at you, witcher*cough*), every character feels purposeful or interesting at least, with witty, funny and FULLY VOICED dialogues of highest quality, every location hides its secrets, leading you towards surprising outcomes, interconnected areas and such - simply exploring the world with no handholding and silly marks never felt so rewarding and enjoyable, holy heck.  Combat system really adds to it, with its fresh approach to the encounters - not only will you need to pay attention to the health bars, but also to the environment, as most spells will interact not only with another spells, but also with the puddles on the ground, the mist in the air, the fire eating your enemies' bodies. The fights are so satisfactional! If you are seasoned player, or turn-based RPGs veteran I definitely suggest you start your first blind new game on tactical difficulty - it's actually dificult, but also greatly amusing.  The story and quests are really good, a noticable jump forward since the first game. Not only NPCs you meet on your road, but also so-called ""origins"" characters are interesting. Each with his own story and mission to fulfill in the world of Rivellon - you really start to like your companions and grow bonds with them.   But not only your mates are accompanying you - there's a great soundtrack in this game, which breaths a captial ""A"" into your Adventures. New composer did an excellent job with creating the OST. He didn't fill the boots after Kirill Pokrovsky - and oh, we should not want him to! - he made something with his own vision, and may he be praised for this, as he did an amazing job on it.  Last, but not least - the game offers you a multiplayer experience with up to 4 players - while not necessary to experience the storry whole, it really adds a pinch of spice to the game. With its diverse combat you will definitely have a great deal of fun with your friends - so if there's an option, I highly recommend going for it.  For a word of closing this review - big shoutout to Larian, for delivering one of a kind game, and satisfying not only kickstarter backers needs, but also these of people who didn't track the game development process at all - and concurrent players counter is a prime example of that. Kudos!"

I did have some issues with it, and I gotta say I'm thoroughly impressed with the response time and care of this company.  I was having a crashing issue at random ( Razor Synapse probably culprit, fake window mode changed as well ), so I fired off an email to the company stating the issue.  In less than an hour I had 4-5 paragraphs on possibilities and known issues, was professional, courteous and insanely fast response time from a great person named ""Raze.""  I went in and as stated before ended the Razor Synapse task and switched to fake window mode and have had no issues at all.  Currently playing a wizard about an hour in with no issues.  I replied back to Raze the good news and the response was fantastic, but if anything else popped up don't hesitate to email back.

Prince-Of_Darkness,186,3,0,"September 29, 2016",Recommended,138.2,"First of all I am going to say THANK YOU Larian studios for making Divinty original sin II. I got it on the first day of Early access and i had faith, and on Sept 14th my faith was rewarded. So here is my review for Divinty original sin II. You see there are a lot of people who does not like turn based RPG, while playing OS1, I recommened it to almost all of my friends and hardly anyone was intrested but OS2 was a different case . Impovement over the first one is huge (NOT THAT OS1 WAS BAD OR SOME I GAVE IT MUST BUY) : 6 Origin stories, and all of them are top notch. : If you dont need origin story you can craft your own character. : While the game was in EA I spent almost 30 hours and that was just the first act of the game. : After release I am almost on 70 hours and the game is no where near it's end. : Ok HUGE game so what about the quality of the game you say, well this game is  good as the witcher3 may be better in some case ( Witcher 3 is also on top of my list)       : Gameplay is Improverd and you dont feel like that the game is stopping you to do something.          You can do what ever you want and ir will have an effect on your game world       : There is no hand holding (most part), So if you killed some NPC for some reason and if he or          she had some quests for you, well say good bye to that one.       : Combat is complex and fun and huge number of new skills and metas are present in game        : True openworld in topdown RPG. You can decide how to complete a quest or how to attack,           how to respond to all the dialouges.       : And did I say all the scripts in the game are voice acted ( So you dont have to read everyting           like in Pillars of eternity, Tyrrany etc) .        : This game is also beautiful, Character models are good, Lighting and vfx on casting spells or            elemental effects all feels top notch.       : Music and audio FX are so dood you can listen to them all time ( Hell i listen to them on my           phone)       : Single player, 4player co op, 2 player split screen( Respect) , PVP Arena so what do you           need more       : All these things in just 996 INR (15USD) and no micro transaction bullcrap.  So This game is a must buy, Do not missout on this one. GOTY 2017 (May be).                                 Peace"

I am a RPG freak, loved the games of old such as Baldur's gate 1 and 2, fallout 1 and 2, Planescape, and more recently Pillars of Eternity and of course The Witcher 3. This game is a statement. A huge ""in your face"" statement that the classic top down RPG genre is far from dead, but instead can evolve to new height.  So why will I stop playing it? I dont want to finish it. This is exactly what happened to The Witcher 3. I cannot bring myself to finish it because I know after that, there will be no more.  I know... Weird. "
GeoTrooper13,224,3,0,"October 8, 2017",Recommended,97.1," TLDR:  Put 100 hours into one playthrough.  A phenomenal RPG experience that is a breath of fresh air.  Even at full price this game is well worth it.  Some pros, neutrals and cons for some quick pointers.  My views and such will be included after but can be ignored if wished.   Pros: Only $45 which is a steal for the amount of content you get. Very lengthy game, 4 world areas with multiple quests in each of them. Servicable story, interesting but nothing mind blowing, same goes for the lore. Lots of side quests to do which can put you in some interesting situations. Very well written characters, this goes for followers and NPCs. Lots of dialogue and options for you to navigate conversations, and every line is voiced too! Very good, tactical, challenging combat.  Lots of ways to approach each encounter. Diversity in how to play characters.  No defined ""roles"" and its easy to completely change a character at any point after the first main area. The entire game is playable in co-op which can be drop in drop out.  Works with up to 4 players.  It even has split screen! Also comes with an Arena multiplayer mode for PvP and a Game Master mode to play D&D with friends.  Basically infinte replayability. Along with that as a bonus they included the Engine for Divinity as a free download.  You can make your own mods, maps, scripted dialogue, etc.  It even has native workshop support to easily upload to. Steam workshop support for easy access to mods.  Neutral: These neutral comments are going to be mostly preferencial for people.  Not a problem for me but I can see how it can be a problem for others. No handholding whatsoever.  Not really an issue for me and some may wonder why this here.  For some I can see an issue with some quests.  There were a few times where I wondered how the game thought I would have been able to figure out certain things.  If you get stuck just have the wiki open, I certainly used it a few times and it was very helpful. No handholding also extends to combat.  Combat can be really challenging at times, almost borderline unfair.  However once you learn all the mechanics of the game and learn how to be scummy it is really satisfying to beat a challenging fight. In my opinion there were a few quests that were poorly designed.  Kinda goes with the point of no handholding, a few of the ways to complete some quests were really convoluted.  Not that many of them which is why it's neutral and not a con.  Cons: Bugs, lots of them.  There are many quest bugs in this game which cause quests not to close out properly.  In my experience I would say there were around maybe 15 or so in total.  Kind of annoying when you fail a quest just because it gets bugged out.  Also the recorded dialogue cuts out randomly some times.  However Larian have been releasing patches so hopefully most of the bugs will all be ironed out eventually. Overall this game was phenomenal, loved almost all of my time with it.  At $45 which gave me about 100 hours on a single playthrough it was absolutely worth the money.  I was surprised I enjoyed it as much as I did since I don't really enjoy isometric RPGs with this kind of combat.  I tried Pillar's of Eternity and could never finish it.  Really it's the combat that prevents me from playing games like this.  However Divinity's combat is extremely well done and I enjoyed it when I learned the in's and out's.  This game is certainly not for everyone, for those that don't like challenging, slow, turn based combat this isn't for you.  If you don't like long winded, role-play driven, lore heavy dialogue and questing this game isn't for you.  If you don't like a lack of handholding in your quests this game isn't for you.  If you like all of the above or are looking for an amazing RPG that says ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• all to modern tropes then I can say with certainty you'll enjoy Divinity: Original Sin 2.  Honestly at full price this game is worth it, on sale it's a must buy.  Hopefully more people will continue to buy this game and support Larian, they fully deserve it and I can't wait to see what they'll do next."

Stormfrenzy88,9,3,0,October 8,Recommended,113.6,This game is the ultimate cRPG. You can just feel the passion and dedication that has been put into this game. It‚Äôs the only one that actually innovates the genre while others are still stuck redoing the 90s. Don‚Äôt get me wrong - I used to love these games back in the day but 2D worlds and antiquated combat systems of infinity style games just feel dated by now and D:OS 2 really improves upon these main shortcoming of the genre.  The main strength of the game lies within its fantastic combat system. Turn-based is the absolute best fit for party based combat that allows for incredible depth. For every encounter there are multiple approaches to consider and the way abilities interact between each other and the environment is just awesome.  Another great thing about the game is how much player freedom it allows. A lot of quests have many different ways to solve them with various outcomes. Not reaching an ideal outcome in a quest will not hinder your progress but the story will just play out differently.   The visual and sound design is truly top notch and does a great job of getting you immersed in the game world. The fully 3D world with rotatable camera is a treat to explore.  It is designed with gameplay first approach and I absolutely love it but that said the story and characters are still fairly interesting and open up a plethora of moral questions that do not always have a clear cut right or wrong answer.   The game‚Äôs lack of hand-holding and signposting mostly feels like a breath of fresh air but can get a bit frustrating at times. Of course that‚Äôs only because the tendency in recent games to overdo it has conditioned us to think less for ourselves so overall I find the direction here to be positive.  The amount of content this game offers is certainly impressive and well worth the cost.  Overall I‚Äôd say that while there certainly is room for improvements Larian has done a good job making this masterpiece that has found a place among my most beloved games of all time. Therefore I would rate this game with a nearly perfect score of 9.5/10.

amelia,155,3,0,October 18,Recommended,154.3,"I have a love-hate relationship with this game. Unfortunately, this game has the same pros and cons as the first part.  I was hoping the second part would be less buggy (but it was really bad, I had brocken quests, and glitches, and a lot of achievements in the multiplayer didn't appear for the guest player before the definitive edition, and so on). I was hoping that they will make enough content for the game, especially for the latest part  (wroooong, tons of half-empty locations, tons of useless npc, some of them look like they might be part of the quests, but they don't). I hated the main quest in the first part, because it was lame love-triangle. In the second part we don't have that (thanx you very much!) but we have a plot twist from Baldur's gate  instead (it might be worse than that, but meh).   But the game mechanics is beautiful! But you can play as undead! But THE TELEPORTATION! This game has some wonderful features which you can use for the exploration, it has some interesting exploites, which you can find, if you know, where to look. For example you can win the fight with guards and npc lvl 8 when you are 4-5, if you are patient and think out of the box. I appreciate stuff like that very much. If you are into turn-based games and tactics, this game has some challenges for you.  So this one is still hard to me. On the one hand I had quite an adventure. On the other hand I finished the game before the Difinitive edition, and it was pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Me and my friend played in coop and we saw it all: crashes, bugged quests, sometimes game couldn't run unless you run a certain file as admin, and so on.  I really don't want to give ""not recommended"". I honestly think that in general this game is enjoyable. But I hope the developers will figure out how to make games from the first attempt, without difinitives and enhansed editions. And I also hope that the next game by Larian Studio will have enough content in any game stage."

Back on the 29th of October 2016 i finally gave in and purchased Divinity Original sin Enhanced Edition with a friend. it was such an exciting journey and i enjoyed it a lot, my only regret is not hearing about the kickstarter for the second game because i would've been all over it. but nonetheless i purchased Divinty Original Sin 2 before release, i knew it was going to be just as good if not better. after playing roughly 18 hours in my first game and getting to the end of Act 1 another friend bough the game and we started again, but who could complain the game was AMAZING. we enjoyed that playthrough all the way up to Arx where one of our party lost interest in the game which brought our journy to an early end, with such a huge time investment into a game i couldnt bring myself to start again so the game was shelved for a long while. many single player attempts were made, some mods were tried but could never get off the ground. then finally this year after hearing the Definitive Edition was coming my friend and i decided we would do it, finally play through from start to finish and it was as good as ever i could hardly bring myself to put the game down. Playing as Loshe was one of the best experiences in this game and i'm glad i picked her, getting to the end of her story and finding a certain item i bagged it and thought nothing of it until i noticed it could be used. I was taken aback it just came out of nowhere, it really hit me and i realized this was the perfect song to end our game. just over 200 hours played, this game is one of the best i've ever played i just wish there was more.  10/10 highly recommend, can't praise it enough."

In my case it's gone horribly wrong though and I paid them $100 instead. Obviously must be a grave error since Kickstarter only deals in illigimate shady deals where devs buy positive reviews, as Steam so openly states if you watch key-based reviews' popup.  Cause obviously, paying twice what you (will) pay makes me all the happier if it's not up to snuff. Or something. Then again bundle-buyers are excluded too, just the perfect price point, Steam's price. How... convient.  Then again no-one will read this anyway, removed from score, hidden away in reviews, you wont read this. Say hi if you do, and think about the pointlessness of this entire review. But yeah, why actually review a game when no-one's going to read this anyway, might aswell add something for the few who do... say... Wibble wibble potato trampoline.

American Tragedy,"2,646",4,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,129.3,"So guys, I must say, I have not experienced something like this for a long time already! On Friday late night I decided to have a look on this game since it was finally fully released and came out of Early Access (which was a complete disaster for me, for some reason) and I was like ""Hm..meh, just another Divinity game, not my type of games, anyway, so I will just play it around for 40 minutes before I go to bed and that's it"" And then I was like: ""WHAAAAAAT?? 5 AM AT THE MORNING?? YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING ME!!!""   This game just kept me! The whole story, gameplay, variety of classes, decent graphics, detailed world and characters - jeesus like everything seems to be perfect for me. I can't stop playing and I really feel that I will play this game for a long time, before I try and explore everything in there! I must admit, they release projects like this very rarely, so don't hesitate and buy this game, ASAP.  So, in summary! You should buy this game if you like:  +RPG (lol, obviously) +Rich story +Turn Based games +Detailed World and Rich Characters +Decent Graphics +Tactical Elements +Variety of Classes  Give it a pass, if you don't like:  -Lot of dialogues  -Long battles (some of them could be really long, hard and stressful, especially if you are playing on a highest difficult, so you will be forced to load your saves once again and again and again and try different tactics and approcahes) -Management. Well, some of my friends believe that games like this are hard and annoying because you need to think of a good team, perfect balance of damage dealing classes combined with healers, tank and rdd. So, if you are affraid of this, this game is not for you. -Lot of classes. 14 different classes. I spent almost 1,5 hours reading guides, trying to understand which class should I pick as for my main. If you don't wanna waste your time, thinking about the perfect class for you -  move along.  That's pretty much it! Have fun!"

I am one of those that always uses the 4 man creation mod and was a bit disappointed to only be able to make one.   Other than great so far! I will update as I play more  (update)  After playing through once and starting a second coop game with a friend I am finding a number of things I missed in my first play through. There has not been much update-wise since I installed, but I have faith in Larian so I will try and be paitent :)   One thing that I am finding in the early game is melee mobility creates a huge imbalance. A caster has usually taken out one to two enemies before my melee has even managed to engage. I think this mostly has to do with the limited gear in the early game and the somewhat absurd amount of ground effects. Ice particularly, I only found one set of ""nails"" for spiking boots, but it wouldn't let me combine them? I think the damage you take moving through fire or poison needs a bit of balancing, two steps tends to do more actual damage than a fireball directly to the face. This is mitigated towards the end of the game when you start getting magical defense on some of the heavier armors.   Updating as I go :)"
hockeyhacker97,"1,145",4,0,"September 16, 2016",Recommended,26.7,"If you played and enjoyed Divinity Original Sin, then you will really enjoy DoS2. It's got all of what made the first game great but has improved on almost every part of that, though I must say my intial save didn't start off that great, my main character I manage to whack myself with my staff in combat hurting myself more then the enemies did, I then get a Lizardman and immediatly light a ""black cat"" that is following me around on fire and then my lizardman on fire, and then I forget how the trading system works and sell all my items to a vendor for nothing in return forgetting to drag the money into the trade window. Definitly a lot more enviornmental combos a lot earlier, like very first fight Rain of blood to spread blood around and cause the enemies to bleed, then corruptionto turn the blood into a poison cloud and poison the enemy, so right off the bat they are bleeding and poisoned and wet before they even get a chance to attack and then when you have lizard man you can then light that poison cloud on fire to cause it to explode to do more damage create smoke and break line of sight. Not a bad little combo for right off the bat.  Conversations have a lot more options with race and origin story adding in more dialog options. A tension meter for when there have been a lot of crimes like theift and murders in an area which effects NPC behaviour, so even if you don't get caught in the act of stealing it could make it harder in the future.  All in all it feels like a much better game (hard to say when the first game was already great) but definitly one where if you liked the first you will love the second, if you didn't like the first odds are there is nothing here that is going to magicly make you like the second unless it was a minor thing that you didn't like that caused you to not like the game (like say not enough dialog options for different characters).  Not much else to say other then the EA is like the first DOS EA, only play it if you don't mind only having access to act 1, if you want to enjoy the entire story all at once for the first time then hold off till the game is actually released."

Sure you'll run into some bugs, the quest journal is a √ºber vague and not everything is completely finished in Chapter I - but it definitely is playable (and enjoyable).  A lovely improvement to the ""original Divinity: Original Sin"".  You liked the previous installment? Then this is a must-have for you! Beautiful graphics, immersive world, rich plot and characters.  The only thing I really don't like is that you can't easily sort your inventory at all (currently).

I like that you can choose whatever start class, and then switch in mid game and use some of the points just to get the one skill that you want to use.  The main downside of the game is the quest browser. It's quite difficult to keep track of all the quest (even more if you are playing with 3 other friends in your party) and you cannot even search for name of quests or npcs that gave you the quest, so either you remember everything, or you get lost among all the quest.  Still I would recommend it to everyone who likes rpgs, the transition between the normal game and the fights (that are turn based) is really good."

PyroReason,563,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,14.0,"Boys, girls. My time on this game was largely spent offline due to deployment which I was fortunate enough to be able to download this immaculate game on  release. A buddy and I grabbed two Xbox controllers and leaned in close to my 15in laptop display and got swallowed into the incredibly fleshed out world fast. I had anticipated this game ever sense its announcement and avoided the early access so that I could indulge in the full experience once it was finished. It was completely worth the wait. I thought that the first Original Sin was amazing, and found mass improvements that I didn't even know I wanted in this new iteration. Everything about this RPG is done so right that so many other games fail to do. If you love Pathfinder, or DnD you'll be right at home with this game. You're steadily guided along a linear world with open exploration aspects that is just enough to satisfy. A lot of RPGs as of late choose to opt for big massive open worlds with maps littered with locations and pointless side quests that are meant to make you feel like you're in control and fail. This is what Original Sin 2 does right. I say the game is linear because it is, but in a very healthy way for an RPG. You're taken to new areas with each progressive plot line quest you complete with the right amount of extra stuff on the side that ties into the main plot either immediately or eventually. Which I love. There were plenty of times where my buddy and I looked at each other and were amazed at either what we were doing, or what the story had come to so far. Fights were grueling and some were drawn out. But with each difficult encounter, a sense of accomplishment rushed over us. A lot of fights are more like puzzles more focused on how you approach the problem at hand rather than just smashing your way through though that's also a valid option. Strategy is key here, and presetting your characters can be the difference between success and death. Something I absolutely loved was the ability to experiment and restat my characters early on in the game and have the ability to do this as I please throughout. Allowing me to mix up my strategies for each new area and enemy I came across if I wanted to. A lot of the stats you improve and traits you take are clear and meaningful. Each class has an applicable role in everything you do inside and out of combat. Skill checks are made pretty frequently and arent the end all be all if you fail one. There are several ways you can approach impasses along your journey and often times are made pretty clear. Nothing was funnier to me than when I got my hands on the teleportation pyramids and could cheese my way through certain places to progress. Sometimes the game even rewards you for trying creative approaches. The visuals here are lush and gorgeous. Environments seamlessly blend together, although on the world map it may not look like it does. You'll go from smashing voidlings to being pummeled by dragons and everything in between. This absolutely my game of the year 2017. Worth every penny"

I never could have imagined how badly it would hook me in. I am now going through my second playthrough on Honour mode and another playthrough with my friends and am finding all sorts of quests and meaningful dialogue I passed by while playing solo.

Mumen Rider,106,1,0,"December 29, 2017",Recommended,91.0,"When I started reading reviews calling this ""the greatest RPG ever made,"" and even ""the greatest GAME ever made,"" I had to  try it. The reviews reminded me a lot of The Witcher 3 and it was for the same reason that I bought and played that game way back when and it's now considered my favorite game of all time. So yeah, I got a little excited.  Then I played the game and I felt kind of disappointed. It seemed extremely difficult and I wasn't used to getting the cold shoulder from a game. By that I mean compared to most games this one does not hold your hand, you won't get arrows pointing you in the direction you need to go, everything you need to know is actually in the dialogue and/or read in notes and books (and sometimes a rare hint from the narrator). I kept feeling confused on where to go and who to talk to and the quest system seemed kind of clunky and hard to understand at first.  I'm ashamed to admit, I asked for a refund at about the hour and a half mark. Then I went a couple days thinking about the game and that I couldn't believe I couldn't get into it. And then I thought about it again and again and realized that something was nagging at me and I couldn't stop thinking about it.  So yeah... I bought the game again. I looked up tips this time around on which characters people like in their party and which skills really help early game (Lone Wolf changed everything for me). And most of all I had to learn to slow down, stop running through rooms like nothing matters. This game made me change the way I approach video games. I started to appreciate the detail and get into the story, and I have to say, the story is absolutely amazing. The characters are all interesting and the situations I found myself in during certain points in dialogue had me on the edge of my seat.  Now I'm 40 hours in and I can confirm, absolutely one of the greatest RPGs ever. And I haven't even had the pleasure to experience co-op with a friend. 10/10"

Ray G. Quit,281,1,0,"November 11, 2017",Recommended,210.4,"Pretty good RPG with a classic feeling to it. A lot of content and a lot of replayability. The fact that you can play it with a friend and give him control over characters (4 party members, so we played 2:2) is just awesome and led to many laughs. I would recommend it and I'll just highlight 3 aspects of the game that were memorable about it in the good, the bad and the ugly (okay, the neutral).   The good: I hate any tactician turn-based game. Often they're overcomplicated. But this one? This one was ... definitely complex but somehow I came around to like it. Everything made sense and learning how things works by setting EVERYTHING ON FIRE was a fun experience. Gameplay is just fun, making a builds and testing them out was great, there's a lot of possibilities to go around. Lots of things to find, lots of ways to resolve an issue, lots of surprises. If gameplay is what you're after then you won't be disappointed.  The bad: BUGS. Oh my god the bugs. Not many - true, but one extended turns in a certain boss fight to make it last forever for enemy to finish his turn. Another one made me lose about 15 hours of progress, because I couldn't access ""home-base"" waypoint and had to load older save. And yet another - by a chance we found out a bug that can make you immortal duplicating an Idol that ressurects you for no cost at all so you could gear up your whole team with immortality idols and pass the game in easy mode. What the hell. Larian fix your game, bugs in key moments are not acceptable, especially after the game came out of early access.  The neutral: Story and lore. Honestly only story for your companions was any good and made you care. Overall the game is about ego trip to become divine and often we were in a pretty good spot to not care about anyone else than our own quest to power. Factions and key characters even when they started as good, sooner or later they ended up not so rightous to a point I didn't mind killing most of them. Never felt there was any greater incentive to be ""the good guy"" or choosing ""the lesser evil"" in this game. The whole world felt not worth fighting for. Maybe that is the point? It's not bad, it definitely had some depth to it, but still felt ""meh""."

Hierophant Druid,24,1,0,"December 6, 2017",Recommended,147.4,"Long have I been looking for a big RPG game in the trend of Baldur's Gate/Planescape Torment and to a lesser extend NWN and NWN2. That wait is over.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 gave me that same feeling I got when I first played Baldur's Gate 2 so long ago. It has a giant sprawling world with so many things to do and so many mechanics to make it even more fun, I spend so much time plotting on how to rob merchants off their goods/money. The turn-based combat is very addicting, I am normally not a fan of turn based combat, but D:OS2 does it incredibly well, very much like X-Com.   For those of you who loved Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 and are a bit turned off by the turn based combat, please give this game a chance because it's the closest thing we have gotten to BG.  The story of this game is alright, there are plenty of mysteries and questions unanswered at the start and middle of the game to keep you engaged. But the main focus in this game is its story and game mechanics. The way the quests and maps compliment each other makes it very addicting to completionists. You want to complete every single quest in each area. This combined with amazing visuals and great sound, it is definitely worth all the money.  I finished the game in about 140+ hours on my first playthrough, and every hour was worth it, I cannot recall a single game (next to BG/BG2) that gave me this many hours of fun in a single playthrough.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 gets a solid 9 from me."

MikiM,125,1,0,August 21,Recommended,267.7,"A living legend you can play now and your kids will play in the future and think - this game defines the cRPG genre 20~H game play: Jumped in to the game expecting it would be like DOS1. After 20~h game play in normal mode I was stone dead and had a unusable character because of a wrong build. I thought to my self - Ok, this is not as DOS1 I have to have a better plan when building my character. The thrill increased and I felt that the game was real   30 - 260~H game play: Next character was better. Played through the game and finished. Right after I started a new character, it keept on going. Played through the game again - and again. On every new start I had a better character and I amped the difficult level.   There are so many option when building a character. With steam workshop the options are almost infinite. 260H game play I have just scratch the surface when it comes to character builds and I love it   The mail story and side quest is not short - but it¬¥s not either super long. Something in between.  If and when a DLC comes I would buy it in a heart beat.  Beyond character builds What made this game even better is split/shared screen local co-op.

frontman12,374,1,0,"December 8, 2017",Recommended,63.4,"7.5/10  I played Divinity: Original Sin 2 with a group of friends as a Persuasive Lizard, focusing on Summoning and Geomancy. Though the boulders and oil that can be thrown with Geomancy are effective, I initially focused on it to serve as a healer for our Undead tank. Undead are healed by poison, so your party's usual healer can't help them out. However, Geomancy also gave me access to Fortify which I could use to restore physical armor, and Artillery Plant, which was my favorite thing in the game. Artillery plant is a summon that exists in the Geomancy tree, whose level is determined by your Summoning skill. In the game, your most powerful skills cost ""source"" to cast (sort of a special type of mana). By the end of the game, you will be able to possess three source points at a given time. Source is rare to come by during most of the game, and even towards the end it's not necessarily unlimited. Artillery plant costs a single source point to cast, but then it can cast an extremely powerful spell called ""Acid Spores"" every two turns, among other strong abilities. If your character were to cast ""Acid Spores,"" instead of the summon, it would cost you two source points every time!  The type of discussion you see above is what makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so exciting. How can you support the other characters in your party in combat, and what is the optimal way to use your source or action points? If a member of your party has the ""Loremaster"" ability, you can examine enemies to learn their abilities, talents, and resistances. If an enemy reduces and redirects damage dealt, you may want to attack his friends first. If he has the opportunist talent, you do not want to walk away from melee range as it grants him an attack. If he has a fire resistance of 150%, fire will heal him. You want to constantly take stock of enemy composition and the skills of your party.  If Divinity: Original Sin consisted of a more linear story with more combat encounters, and lasted about 2/3 of its current length, it would be a 10/10 game for me. However, as it stands, I have a few gripes.   Although I'm sure that many players appreciate the ability to complete quests in multiple ways, I just found it frustrating. Some of the solutions are obtuse, and require a lot of poring through documents. Some of the late game puzzles, like pulling levers in a certain order or playing the enormous ""pipe dream"" game, were just tedious. There are many many quests, and in a multiplayer party it just felt like I was always receiving experience from somewhere because someone in my party was progressing on one of the many many quests in my quest log. While I'm sure some might say that I should've played with a different group of people, there are so many quests with so many solutions that often we made quest progress by aimlessly walking around.   Another issue I had with the title is just how quickly my character advanced. Each character has a maximum of 40 in an attribute, a maximum of 10 in each skill or combat ability, and a maximum of 5 in each civil ability. Each character in our party maxed out at least one of these categories well before the end of the game. In addition, the highest tier of skills in the game become available at level 16, also well before the endgame. Though perhaps others are drawn primarily for the story, this severely hampered my enjoyment of the game. After learning all skills I was interested in, maxing my summoning and my persuasion, I just didn't have as much to look forward to.  I enjoyed most of my time with Divinity: Original Sin 2. The argument could be made that this type of game just isn't for me, but I enjoyed the combat so much that is was worth some of the other irritations."

hornhollow,650,1,0,"October 1, 2017",Recommended,83.7,"I just finished my first playthrough last night. Let's get this out of the way: this game is something special. It improves on almost every gripe I had with the original (mainly just story and pacing) and just knocks it out of the park. This is a new gold standard for what a modern RPG should be.    What's Good The companions are memorable, well-written, and have realistic motivations that make negotiating their place in your party really engaging as you strive for the end-goal of the game. (I mean, it makes sense, you can play them as the main character if you wish!)  Combat rewards creativity, exploration, and experimentation without ever feeling like it's unfair towards the player--some fights are tough as nails, but they're just puzzles that you've been given an entire toolbox to solve. It's incredible just how many viable strategies you can employ to build a party and the myriad tactical decisions you can make in combat with those interactions.  Some of the quests and puzzles are pretty inspired--I'm a DM for tabletop group and I can appreciate how hard it is to make a puzzle that's challenging and feels organic to its context while delivering on fun. So hard to do, and 90% of the quests and puzzles in D:OS2 deliver. The quests often have multiple paths to resolution, which can be incredibly satisfying.    (Minor) Gripes I only encountered a few bugs over the course of my game and none of them were show-stopping. (A few dialogue options that didn't make sense because of my choices; quicksave reload breaking a script in combat and requiring rollback; a few quests not updating / reflecting change after I made major progress in them.) The lion's share of these happened in the last two major areas of the game--which I totally understand given the sheer scope of the game.   Long story short: there hasn't been an RPG this rich in a long time. It's worth every penny of the price tag."

Nothing has to be done in a certain why, at a certain time, its your story and you do it your way 3.

When other games such as Shadow of war are at 80 hours Max( and cost 15$ higher ) , what more could you be asking from a gaming company?  In summary: iF you enjoyed the witcher series as much as i did and , you love rpg games with items, puzzles, explorations, and dialogue--->or and you are a DND fan ,this game ... is a BUY IT!!

That being said, I've probably played through this game like 6 times so far and not only is it still so fun, I'm pretty certain there are still things I have yet to see! The game is amazing as is, but the mods really let you take it to the next level.  Already, there are mods for crafting, combat balancing, new spells/items, and a host of other really cool/enriching elements that can be added.  I love to browse the workshop to see how I can spice up my next play through.  I'm more of a single-player person and so I haven't tried playing this game online, but I imagine if you enjoyed multiplayer then there will be 100s of more hours of quality gaming to be found with D:OS 2.

yvesp,67,1,0,"December 26, 2017",Recommended,375.6,"Larian turned gold to lead, but this game is probably worth it, provided that you know what you do.  First off, choose wisely your play level. I chose tactician as a veteran of RPG. I was well served. Indeed, tactician it is! But it doesn't say that you should also scratch every single little advantage that you can (steal as much as possible, stack on potions etc.) in order to be well prepared for the last fight. It also doesn't say that you shouldn't expect your characters to be heroic! Indeed, in many situations at that level you will have to resort to cheesy tactics such as some characters fleeing the combat to recover skill timers, heal, then come back while the combat has been frozen because you left one character or invocation hold it... Or by reloading consistently because you were not prepared for a nasty surprise in a combat and had nothing left to deal with it; so you reload, come back with smart prepositionning and the combat will go smoothly. I remember a fight against some outrageous horror -helped by numerous cronies, all of them more powerful than my characters despite being one level above-, which I easily lost head to head, then won after reloading, placing my characters far enough, engaging with invocations and keeping my characters far enough -actually out of combat- that I could always cast a new invocation when one died. I finally won that fight without a scratch. Smart ? sure. Pleasurable ? Hardly.  So unless you like going very slowly, always moving like there is a fight at the next step (or reloading often), managing inventories to be sure each character has the absolute best equipment, has the necessary consumables,  and so on (i.e. total micromanagement), skip the tactician level. At normal level, the game is going to be challenging enough for most players. Especially the last combat, which I never finished -I have done quite well in the first part, but am hopelessly outnumbered in the second part. I probably know what is wrong, but I won't be going back batching the potions that I am missing, respecing my characters to more useful stats, traits and spells, changing runes for more useful ones etc. you get the picture for tactician level.- So, I won't know the end of the story line I chose, and I won't change my storyline just so the last combat is easier. That's a bit sad.  And NO: YOU CANNO'T CHANGE THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL DOWN! That's a real shame!  Also, there is no excuse for larian in turning an excellent character development/combat system into the mediocre thing that it has become. In that respect, Original Sin 1 was way better. The current system has clearly been designed in order to foil the player and outrageously favor the opponents. You cannot inflict secondary effects (blinding, stunned etc.) as long as the target has magical or physical armor (a new protection that comes above your hit points.) This means that the first rounds of combat are always going to be damage dealing: you won't have any crowd control coming until you've done some attrition first. Worse: the system favors teams which choose a damage type and stick to it. I made the mistake of wanting a balanced party: the result is that I am too weak for the last fight. Actually in some fights, I had characters standing aside, watching the combat go because they did not deal the right kind of damage...  After all this has been said, I still recommend this game because the story looks good, the world is well developped and generally speakig as RPG go, it stands on the top if you don't fall into the trap where I fell.  EDIT: I finally found the courage to do what I said I wouldn't do, and of course finish the game. As expected, I had to respec my characters, and decided to go for lone wolf. The advantage in lone wolf lies not in the power of the characters (they indeed are stronger, but you have overall less firepower), but in the fact that you don't have to bother about the survival or such and such character, as well as reducing the drain on your consumables (you use two instead of four for a similar effect.) The fight was easy [SPOILERS (light) AHEAD] mostly for use of the special tea sold by Mrs Kremm, combined with at least +50% full elemental protection potions and five star dinner -i.e. all elemental damage did heal me, which both let me remove most healing spells as well as use my own offensive spells for healing-, the pawn and duck duck goose (for good movement, not mentioning spells.) Other talents which I thought would help did not (guerilla) [END SPOILERS] ; I changed my main character from pure mage to hybrid melee (fighter) / mage, helped by an archer/assassin ; as explained above, this was a choice to favor physical damage over magical damage, choice made necessary by the difficulty of that fight. I of course had to spend considerable time to prepare the characters and the consumables, buy or craft the required potions and books as well as redistribute equipment. The trouble is that in that fight I did not recognize the character(s) I played consistently from the beginning (no respec before the end), which is annying (to say the least) for a RPG! The other trouble is of course that I could not have to feeling that the hero was well above the other contenders to deserve my victory. Indeed, the stats of all other human opponents were consistently above those of the hero. Understand who can!"

However, a colleague told me about Original Sin and I've purchased D:OS EE and had a blast with it. Unfortunately, I arrived late to the party and didn't get a chance to help Larian with their kickstarter for D:OS2, but I did pre-order it (which I almost never do). And I'm glad I did.  The goodThere are some good changes to the first game: - you can choose your companion's class when you recruit them - you can respec your character and your companions at almost any time! - if you respec, you don't lose your learned spells/skills - you now have a skill bar with many slots at the bottom of the screen - summoning, hands-down one of the best class in the game; summons can really turn the tides of battles, especially since they can be infused with different elements - full voice acting (I know EE also has that, but the original D:OS didn't)  The so-soThere are also some changes, let's call them neutral; some I've learned to like, while others not so much: - physical and magic armor: you first have to tear through your opponent's armor before you can apply any CC to them; this bothered me a lot at first, when I didn't have the means to get rid of their armors easily, but, as you gain more skills and spells, it becomes less of a problem; there are still some weird things about this system, like you fight an attack dog and it has physical armor for no reason (I mean, I understand when a human enemy has physical armor because he has a breastplate, but a naked dog?) - you have to spend skill points on Memory, which increases your skill slots; I didn't like this at first, because I'd want to spend my points on other attributes; however, it isn't as bad, as you receive free Memory slots when leveling up at certain levels - Source Points; I still don't like this mechanic as some of the best abilities are now locked behind the need of source; these good abilities already had the disadvantage of using more than 1 Memory Slot, but you also need Source to cast them; of course, you can steal source from enemies or corpses, but enemies can also steal you source - a bit of spoiler ahead: the companions that are not in your party at the end of the first area will die, so you cannot see their storyline for the remainder of that playthrough; in my opinion, this is horrible game design, but I guess it helps with replayability - your party members can leave you permanently late in the game, depending on dialog choices, even though you had a good relationship with them (high attitude) until then; I was shocked when this happened, because I don't understand what the point of companion attitude is - new game modes: PvP and Game Master; I haven't tried these yet, so I don't know if they're good, but they're there - it also comes with a free Map Editor  The badThe game also has some bad parts, of course: - I didn't play it when it launched because I was sure there were going to be bugs. I've waited for a week or two and a few patches and played it without major technical issues (though I did have a 100% crash in an area that had a lot of lava around, but lowering the graphical settings resolved that). - on the gameplay side, as many have pointed out, the last part (Arx) isn't as good as the rest of the game, but it's not really that bad. There are some weird fights with respawning enemies in a certain embassy, but those can be avoided by sneaking. P.S.: When writing this review, I'm just before the last fight, so I'm not sure what that's like.  The uglyRed Prince and the lizard kin. They're ugly AF.

I typically find top down cRPGs rather boring but this is definitely one of the top 10 games I have ever played. Time will tell where it lands but it is incredibly good.  There are plenty of full reviews out there so read those if you want a general review. Here is what I specifically like about it: Larian loves its players and it shows.  They really do. In DOS2, you can customize this game to make it the game you want to play. For example, I am not a hardcore CRPG guy. I like a more casual experience and I also want to play this with my partner, preferably without having to cash out for a second copy. While that might be difficult for most games in the genre, DOS2 lets us set the difficult to Explorer (which feels perfectly balanced for us) and play coop in split screen. It also allowed us to redo our builds after the first act so that any mistakes made could be adjusted without having to start over again. It also autosaves plenty, so we could easily recover from any mistake.  I could easily see how I could play DOS2 by myself and love that too. Or to play it with 3 friends who really love hardcore games. In fact, this is the closest any videogame has ever come to being a tabletop pen and paper roleplaying game IMHO.  Can't wait for DOS3."

It is because of this reason why it took me so long to buy the first Divinity: Original Sin. However, the combat in this game is fantastic. Unlike most turn based games where you continue select your strongest attack over and over again, the combat in this game is very strategic. Most encounters are completely unique and you must learn what works against your current enemies and how to use your environment to your advantage. If you're on the fence about this game because you're someone like me, who normally stays away from turn based games, just get it! Even if it's not on sale, it's worth every penny.

Gwynbleidd,86,1,0,January 19,Recommended,109.1,"What a brilliant game.  I am not a great fan of turn-based RPGs (or at least wasn't till now) but D:OS2 really changed that. The combat system is simply epic, both in terms of visuals and dynamics. It is so much fun to fight with strategies and due to the well-balanced difficulties, most of the fights are very exciting.  Exploring is also incredibly fun. The game has maps of decent sizes but more importantly, each act is generously full of well-scripted contents. You never know what you will find but you always know you will find something that makes your exploration valuable!  The story is quite compelling. Side stories, however, are often even more compelling. Additionally, all characters you meet have a personality that speaks to you on a human level. The attention to details for creating such a lively world should really be appreciated. Even animals have individually established personalities that make meeting them much more fun. Similarly, the dialogues are of the same quality. Very good voice acting and very well written lines.  The open-world aspect is, again, very good. The number of options you have through the gameplay is vast and unlike most other open-world games, your choices actually matter. Abundance of options applies not only to your choices of progressing through the storyline but to each part of the game. Almost everything expects some decision from you.    Graphics are very stylish and they look really good. Just by looking at the screenshots you can tell that this is a game with a fantastic world that will immerse you 100%.   The price is completely worth is without a doubt. You can easily expect 100-110 hours of gameplay from D:OS2.  In my opinion, if you like the genre of RPG at all, don't even hesitate to buy this game. This is a RPG masterpiece. "

This is the caliber of gaming you (EA devs) should truly attempt to employ!!!! It's an absolute masterpiece of Early Access gaming. A true game of D&D mixed with chess.......Larian said they posted this game on steam with a laugh, and I know why!! Ok I'll stop with the hype and explain.   (Graphics, optimization, controls, gameplay, sound.)   Graphics/Animations: 10/10  Right from the jump you notice how polished the world and characters look. From beautiful landscapes to fluid animations, I love it!!!! Nothing left to say here! Excellent job!   Optimization: 10/10  No loading screens.. LIKE EVER during your gaming experience! Excellent work!   Controls: 9/10  No complaints other than the restriction of your camera angles. Part of the experience is viewing a gorgeous and artistic world... You can never look at the sky....and view your character from better angles.. sad. Although, you can rebind your keys, you can rotate and zoom in - You feel like you're in control. Great job!   Gameplay: 9.5/10  This is where the bulk of the game lies. From story to combat - the immersion starts with the world appearance and story narrative, then ends with a blast with its' combat delivery. The combat is spaced out making you feel like you're not always in a chat box, and you'll be satisfied in casting, buffing or even simple melee attacks.  You can be whatever you want to be. Unless you want to be an orc...you can't be an orc - BUT what you can do from what they have to offer makes you feel like you're totally in control of your character's person.   Yes, customization is quite limited. I like my rpgs to let me customize my character to the ""T"" ... and this does limit you in that aspect to a certain extent...better than most games but coming from MMOs you may be disappointed. Given a more customizable character and maybe even adding a few other races .. you'll never play the same character again. Character creation is key in this type of genre - still ...

xace,56,1,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,65.8,"One of the best games I have ever played.  Several bugs and lack of features make it fall just short of that #1 however.  My main concerns are in multiplayer. You have to play as the hosts party characters and not your own. That means playing an archer with a level 2 bow, all stats in wits and other useless talents. There is also an endless amount of bugs with multiplayer. For example, if I am host and start a multiplayer and someone joins me as say The Red Prince and I save, restart whatever, that character then becomes bugged. Instead of reverting back to The Red Prince after that player leaves, he bears that persons name and is unable to be reset, or even dismissed. You normally can talk to npc's in your party and say you want to go your seperate ways and recruit another party member, nope. bugged.  Another example is I use one of my npc's for dialect options since they have persuasion stats and my main is undead. Someone joined the game and took control of MY character and when I leveled up he butchered his stats and skills and those remained on my character after I kicked him and / or restarted the game.  These things make multiplayer extremely frustrating and have forced me to start brand new games probably about 6 times now. I haven't even been able to get through act 1. I am very wary to play in multiplayer due to all these reasons and despite preferring multiplayer in it's theory am forced to play single player to avoid game breaking bugs like those i mentioned. I wish I could provide some feedback or get some kind of bug fix on this bug I don't see an option for that. Thankfully the developer is very involved in the game and will probably fix this at some point. I am now hoping that a user created mod will fix many of these issues in the future (thank god this game has mods)  Despite all my frustrations this game is absolutely incredible in every other aspect. Everything is voiced, every npc which is amazing. Graphics are good (not great) especially for this type of game. Quests are actually fun and not all fetch they actually have lore. There is an absolute freedom: you can kill every npc and still proceed with the game. The gameplay is some of the best ever. This genre has been ruined in the past decade with games like the Final Fantasy series dropping the traditional turn-based combat for an active combat. Yeah, thats nice in some circumstances but it is extremely boring hacking and slashing repetitively just like every other game. The combat in D:OS2 is calculated, and detailed. Everything is listed and heavily focused on strategy and statuses. The game encourages using environments such as high ground and environmentals like barrels and puddles in order to gain favor in battle.   The best part of the game is the fact it's challenging. The default difficulty will probably be too hard for average gamers and those not familiar with the genre or the first game. There are two higher difficulties on top of that which are extremely challenging (I normally play on the highest difficulty in every other game) The next best thing would be that the developers aren't EA, Ubisoft, Activision, etc and force paywalls on an incomplete game and don't support the game after launch. This dev actually cares and I have personally downloaded atleast one patch per day and they have already stated that they are going to implement being able to use your own character in multiplayer which is something I look forward to. Can't wait to see what's next for this game."

Gilmez,113,1,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,217.3,"THE STORY: This is by far the most densely rich lore I‚Äôve played through from any game I‚Äôve played, where almost everyone and everything is connected in one way or another. Creating a living and breathing world, where one‚Äôs actions and decisions will affect their adventures through Rivellon. The part where this game shines the most, is how it gives the player choices on how they want to advance the story in any way the player chooses to play. Choose to be good, evil, just or whatever mood you choose, this game adapts to it and guides you to the end that your choices led to. While I‚Äôve only completed Fane‚Äôs Story (in the moment of writing this), the endings it gives you will satisfy however you played. While you can choose how your adventure ends, the game lets you know how those actions will affect Rivellon in the future. The reason why I love this story is how grim and real this story plays out, no one is truly good or evil, it‚Äôs all a grey area, but it‚Äôs your choice on how you want to navigate in it.  THE COMBAT: There was never a dull moment every time I went into battle, or stumble on to one. While combat is turn-based, pre-battle is when things become interesting. Some approaches I found to be more fun is laying out traps and pre-emptive attacks on unknowing enemies. I can go into combat with my enemies clinging on 5% health and wipe them out with one attack. This is true liberty that this game gives to players, it gives you the tools and it‚Äôs up to you on how to use them. And this is just combat, skills can give a creative twist to combat. You can chain attacks to deliver devastating blows to your enemies or toy around with them by unleashing various Statues Effects and skills that can either immobilize them or transform them into chickens. All this creates a simple yet complex toy box you can play with. Finding out what seems fun and effective will make you want to seek out the next battle and unleash your battle plan.  THE MUSIC: I do not, in any way, have any complaints or criticisms about the music. The only thing I can say is that it is Divine. The music makes Rivellon and in turn makes you believe that it is a real place and these characters who live in it are part of a giant play. The 4 instruments that you can pick (while you build your character) creates the mood in how you want to play and you can change it any time you want.  This is the best RPG for this generation. While there are quite a few bugs the developer needs to fix, this doesn‚Äôt affect how much I love this game. "

Octus,85,1,0,January 2,Recommended,68.4,"Alright, this game is possibly one of the best RPG's I have ever touched in my entire life, and that's saying a lot because I've played a ton of them. I've never done a long review for a game like this but I love this game so much that I want more people to buy it and support the developers so we can get a thrid one if possible. To start it off this game is full content and story. The story is good, the characters are good, even the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing environment is good. Scratch that, everything feels done amazingly! I've never felt so immersed in a game like this. There are times were im ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing energetic as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to know more about the story and progress through the game. I've never felt a feeling like that in a long time and it wakes me the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up like drinking a hot glass of coffee and a blow job at the same time. On the first 2 days, I had already 24 hours clocked into it, I was highly addicted and I still am.   There so much replayability, you can be the option of a sharpshooter Marksmen or a one-shot force of nature that can blow bosses back to the void and hell itself. Or, say ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it! And just change it whenever you want. The game allows you to be flexible and the flexibility feels great especially if your a person who loves testing and trying out different styles. The characters in this game feel alive and immersive, they actually put effort into the voice acting its ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing amazing, the story is wonderful im not gonna spoil it but you get really attached to people in the game. The gameplay is also fun if you've played xCOM this game is gonna be highly recognizable and incredibly addicting. And do you wanna hear the best part? There is 0 Grinding. That's right, not a single point in the game was I forced to grind off of enemies and it felt ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing amazing. Every battle has a purpose and every purpose has a reason, and I love it so much.   But there is no such thing as a perfect game. There are sometimes bugs and freezes but its probably my fault for playing too long and overheating my computer. There's also that occasional what the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and where do I go type of vibe rarely every once and a while but I think its good and bad thing because the game doesn't hold your hand but it also makes you somethings look up tutorials and walkthroughs on how to get things done if you're completly confused.  There are also those weird bugs but I don't expect any game to be bugless and as of right now the bugs are quite harmless and not game breaking luckily. Overall I give this game a solid  8/10.  Its fun, addicting, and you'll get hooked in the first couple hours of playing it. I recommend you buy it for the sake of supporting the wonderful devs and for you, the person reading this so you can play this yourself and enjoy it."

Shadow,157,1,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,11.6,"So my early impressions:  Pro's  Good Graphics Good Sound Amazing character creation (I recommend Origin Character)  Con's  ~The questing can be difficult as the game does not exactly tell you where to go or what to do. There are some quest markers on the map but not for all quests. Basically if you enjoy a ton of exploring this game is for you. Personally I like my quests to be more laid out, it's just a choice thing. ~I also find the game fights to be very challenging, but also overly reliant on the game wanting you to use elemental combos. Trying to beat down an oppenent that is not weak to a certain element or combo just will not work. But using rain then hail, or oil then fire, or rain then electric = easy fight.  If I rated this I would give it a 7/10. If the questing was a tad easier/laid out more clearly it would be a 10/10 for me. Again that is just a personal choice with RPG type games. For sure a buy.  **Edit** Need to patch a few bugs I have found. The main one being the quest journal not updating."

civb,279,1,0,February 23,Recommended,398.7,"A wonderful game with a great (if flawed) combat system, fun characters, an interesting world with deep lore and most importantly it has a full co-op story experience. You'll want to replay this game with new character ideas or to test your knowledge of the game in tactican or honour mode. But if I thought DOS1 was brilliant and needed changes, then I must admit I feel the same way about DOS2. My main issue being that the combat system filters you to certain ways of playing which DOS1 did too but DOS2 does in different ways. Party of 4? Stick to either physical or magical damage focus for all, as mixing stats makes both weak or one side essentially useless (but doable on explorer mode). Party of 1 or 2? Hit that Lone Wolf talent on character creation and you'll have the most fun the game can give. To an extent you can mix damage skills quite well and not have a bad character.   With that said, you'll have many hours of fun making characters that work and even those that don't (which you can thankfully fix after act 1)."

Nightsrow,68,1,0,February 6,Recommended,165.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 reawakened sensations I haven't felt in many years. This is definetly one of the better games I have played in a long time. If I am being fairly honest, I did find the combinations of genres a tad bit peculiar, I do however enjoy the core genres a lot seperatly (RPG, Turn-Based Strategy, Story Rich, Character Customization), so I decided to give it a shot anyways. I was a bit reluctant to pay +45$ for it, but holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•am I glad I did. I do have a few Issues with the game, but they are heavily outweighed by the positive aspects (+ for positives, - for negatives).   + Fantastic setting  Now I have no prior experiences with the early/earlier title(s), but the game did a splendid job of introducing me to all the different kinds of political strife, discrimination predujice, as well as the fanatical religious zealots. I quickly became aware of the kind of world my character was living in, so I could more easily integrate the character I wanted to play.   + Beautiful landscapes  The maps are by no means short of details, with the next accessible area being even more astonishing than the first. I can't even fathom how many hours went into designing these places.   + Intriguing story	 I will make this one brief & completely spoiler free. The story is absoloutely captivating in almost every aspect.   + Loveable cast of characters  All of your potential followers (with the exception of Mercenaries), all have their own unique storylines, and backgrounds, with your game experience changing depending on who you choose to bring with you along for the ride. Personally I was especially intrigued by characters such as Lohse & Sebille, but should you decide to try out the game for yourself, you might yourself intrigued by other characters.   + Side activities, rewards & exploration   The game does a great job of keeping you busy, there is never a lack of stuff to do. Honestly 50% of the time you will probably have +10 unfinished quests in your journal. The game also does an even better job of making sure you are properly rewarded, and that also accounts for exploration. Matter or fact the game almost encourages you to explore & do side quests, because the game gets exceedingly hard if you don't make sure to gain a few levels.   + Regretting class choice? No problem homie.  Did you initially choose a stealthy assassin, but you'd actually rather play as a blazing pyromancer? Not a problem the game has got your back. After the 1st Act you are able to change reallocate your stat points, afterwards just get some new suitable equipment and you are good to go.  Now I could go on and on, about what I love about this game, but I also want to get into some of the few issues I have with the game.   - Normal difficulty is too hard at first (for newcommers).  Now I am by no means a hardcore gamer, like I previously was (I am more of a casual these days), but I personally found the earliest stages of the game too tedious to play through on the normal difficulty, and I ended up getting a bit stuck at one point, so I had to lower the difficulty until I could establish a solid foothold. However once I did get a foothold, I went back to the normal difficulty, to find it to be perfectly suitable, but an interresting challenge.   Tag values.  (For the unintiated ""tags"" are basically character descriptions. E.g. you choose wether your character was an established educated noble, or a battleready savage) Now no playthrough should ever be the same, which is why I can accept some missions only being accessible with certain followers. What I cannot accept is some character tags granting access to certain quests, while others are pretty useless apart from a few entertaining dialouges. For instance, during Act 2, you will be barred from certain quests if you don't have the scholar tag, whereas (from my own experience at least), the Barbarian tag only allows for some savage remarks. It does slightly ruin the RPG element of the game. And I honestly don't want to be forced to pick the scholar tag to get the most enjoyable experience with the game. I don't know about you, but I don't want my bearded-battlescarred-battleaxe wielding-viking warrior to be a bloody bookworm.   What to do next?   This is likely my biggest issue with the game.. I have 1 sentence to describe this in better words..  Thank ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• for online guides!..	 I would really be at a terrible loss without them. The game does a mediocre (at best) job of telling you where to go next. For instance I often found myself struggling to get through opponents 2 levels higher than me (mostly in act 2), because the game did not inform me of the best area to go to in order to level up. I initially did learn to save often so if I found myself in an unwinable battle I could always retreat, explore elsewhere (hopefully the right places), get some levels and return later. Although it was very frustrating at first. Another point I want to make is that the player journal feels incredibly clumsy to look at, so I did often find myself unsure of the next approach to take on certain quests in order to proceed, so I had to look up guides so I could figure out what to do, (the game can feel like a bit of a puzzle once in a while).   = Multiplayer experience	 Can't really comment since none of my homies, play this game (And I have no real interrest in playing it with strangers), but I have only heard great things about it.   Rating	 Despite the issues I have with the game, none of them are actually gamebreaking, and are pretty much easily fixable, and their are - as I said earlier - heavily outweighed by the positive aspects of the game. All in all it is definetly worth your hard-earned money. I will rate this game a staggering = 9/10  (Also I do apoligise for any grammatical errors)."
ifm2181,18,1,0,February 6,Recommended,83.1,"With so many ways to play and succeed, DOS2 rekindles that old feeling of D&D the way many have wanted for a long time. If you're used to a game that holds your hand, you might find yourself confused or lost, as there's minimal help in the game. But if you want adventure, strategy and tactical gameplay, you may have found your time-killer. Well worth the money.  THE GOOD - The story is well-fleshed out and full of characters you'll see (or not see, if they die) again at some point. - Combat is tactical, complex, and sometimes downright difficult, even on the easiest setting. Sometimes it felt like sitting at a table of miniatures and contemplating the next move like a game of chess.  The AI is quite good, and the enemy may stay just out of range and teleport your characters into lava. - Characters are almost completely customizable at a certain point, so if you don't like something, feel free to swap it out when you want. - Audio is rather engaging. - The game easily remembers things you've done and never turns out the same way twice. - Carry weight feels limitless, so you won't have to worry about over-encumbrance bothering your honest gameplay. - Vendors have good gear almost all the time, refreshing frequently, though almost anyone can be traded with.  THE BAD - Inability to go back to previous zones for exploration or completion of side quests with no relation to the main story. This can lead to forgetting a map you just got used to, and having to learn a whole new one. - For some players, explorer mode may in fact be too difficult at some points, and you may feel boxed in, unable to explore or retreat. - Occasionally, controls regarding moving characters or unchaining them momentarily feels hamfisted. Taking extra steps to just make one character go somewhere is awkward. - There's almost never a time when you're not standing on a corrupt surface in combat, which requires extra effort to clean, extra effort you likely can't put in on time to change it. This means a large portion of your combat time will be spent dealing with endless DOTs and also an inability to heal your characters. - Pet Pal is an almost essential talent to have for one character, wasting some more valuable talent space for the ability to talk to rats.  THE UGLY - Crafting feels like an incomplete feature. Recipes are learned via experimentation or finding it in a book somewhere, but there are many times when you simply would have no clue how to craft things, and don't need to because vendors have what you need. Would you have thought you could make lockpicks by combining a hammer and nails? Never did discover how to make trap disarming kits.  SUMMARY Definitely a great game. Buy it and enjoy it, over and over again."

I have started and restarted this game countless times already to play through it with many different friends and I still haven't gotten tired of it.

Pros: ++ Incredible cooperative experience + Highly replayable (from nature of the game, GM mode, and mod support) + Interesting story + Cool ""origin"" characters + Fun tactical turn-based combat + Pretty good soundtrack + High-quality narration  Cons: - Could use some quality of life changes (items auto-adding to hotbars is annoying, having a designated barterer/looter because of the way skills work hurts the gameplay soewhat, etc. Just nit-picky stuff though)  Overall, this game far exceeded the expectatins I had when I purchased it.

I've nominated this game for the ""Mom's Spaghetti"" Steam Award 2017.  9.5/10"

Truly an amazing and in depth game.

Overall I highly recommend DOS2, and would encourage anyone to try it out!"
Astroflap,78,1,0,August 31,Recommended,125.9,"TL;DR Buy this game! Best RPG game I've ever played and in my top 3 games of all time without a doubt. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay here. The gameplay is quality unlike games like Skyrim which pretty much relies on mods to be fun for extended play sessions, which this game also offers. Dialog and story is also some of the best you'll find in recent games with  every piece of dialog being voiced which is just a great thing for an Indie game to do.  Seriously 9.9/10 game.  This is honestly the best RPG I have ever played and one of the best games I've played in general. This is one of the few single-player games that I just can't stop playing.   Before I played this game me and my friends played a lot of D&D, but we couldn't find enough time to play as much as we'd like since we were in our final year of school. So for ages I looked for a game that could emulate that same expirence. Being able to do what I want, having funny moments as well as epic. When one of my friends showed me this I was hooked.   The mechanics are almost the exact same as old school table top games, so iif you're into that turn based combat you'll love this, but even someone like me that normally hates those kind of combat mechanics in games I just loved these just because of how polished they were. The combat suprisingly has a lot of depth to it. There's so many different spells and equipment and many of them interact with eachother in their own ways.  The story and dialog is also one of the best I've ever seen in a game. Most of the dialog has so much character and is of such high quality, only of the voices feel as they were acted poorly, but 10000x better than you'll see in any Bethesda game. The fact that all of the dialog in the game is voice acted is also just an amaznig thing. It makes it feel as you're living in a real world and it also helps with the consistancy where some lines would be voiced and some wouldn't. This wouldn't mean anything iff the story wasn't good, which thankfully it isn't. The story is so good. It pulls you emotionally in so many different directions and you have to make so many decisions that make or break relationships and have an effect on what happens for the rest of the game.  Character creation is also pretty good, different races and classes having different traits and abilities as per usual. This part is the only part that I find to be pretty hard on new characters since some races and classes are harder to play than others, which can make it difficult and punishing. This can become a non-issue early in the game since you have the choice to pretty much change everything about you if you're not happy about it.  The one thing that I wish could be different about the game is its modding cababilities. Sadly as of now there aren't any mods anywhere near as big as mods that you find in Bethesda games, but thankfully this isn't a Bethesda game so you don't need mods to make it interesting lmao. This game does have the ability to act as your own Dungeon Master and make a whole game for you, your friends and your fellow steam gamers. and you also have the ability to download other peoples campains which just extends the hundreds of hours in the base game.  This game is almost a perfect example of what a game should be. For the gamer by not constantly trying to ram microtransactions down every hole in your body, have hundreds of high quality content from launch. Constant interaction with the community, THESE GUYS MAKE VLOGS MAN!!! and last but not least they don't do what every triple-a developer is doing now and making all their content and just releasing it as expansions. These guys are just about to release a FREE expansion that adds hundreds of more hours of gameplay which I would be more than happy to pay for since it is actually worth it and it's made to add value to the game instead of be a stupid cash grab.     SO IN SUMMARY. Buy this game, its amazing how an indie studio made on of the best games of recent times from a kickstarter with a reasonably small studio compared to multi-billion dollar companies that make subpar games at best. These people really care about what they create and it shows in their final product. I recommend this game to everyone and I feel like a better person everytime I do so."

Nxmzy,180,1,1,September 15,Recommended,72.6,"AHHHHHHHHH where to start. You are thrust into a world of magic without knowing what to do, but you use something called the HUMAN BRAIN to explore and inspect the world around you talking to every detailed and voice acted character, listening to the smooth Chocolaty voice of the narrator. This is your world, this is your land to trade and kill on or that's what I would say if it was an MMO but THIS GAME GOOOD is what I'm trying to hint at.  The Gist - You start out as a prisoner the lowest of the low (kinda, Prisoner might not be the best word for this) and are shipped off to an island for reasons you need to find out by playing the game. You try to escape and meet whatever your goal is. One thing to note is this game does not hold your hand you have to find out what you want to do or what you want to be.  Combat - The game consists of a turned based D&D styled combat where you have your move and initiative whoever has the highest initiative goes first lowest last etc... There are Spells scrolls abilities and more you can also just attack (melee) It can be very action packed at times where you're at your last heath and the enemy misses giving you one last chance ONLY TO MISS AS WELL there are also huge monsters that can kill you almost instantly in not prepared. [combat 9/10] There are just times when it doesn't work as well though  AI - Brain dead at times but it works, and can also be funny. [ AI 7/10 ]  Story - The story is kinda Celica BUT it works how everything molds together and even better for each main quest there are usually about 10 different ways you can do it or you could just skip it all together (this might only be for the first section the skipping part IDK that yet)  Map(s) - There's about 4 of them and they are each with there own story and problems you can choose to fix or simply just kill them all the people (BTW I tested this and yes you can kill every one IKR AMAZING I LOVE KILLING!!!!!) no people no problem. Every map is diverse and different from the last with different looks and settings which only helps the game to feel EVEN MORE ALIVE. (Maps 10/10) They are all ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING fantastic love em.  Quest system and shizz - For you to start a quest you must speak to someone who has one right? YAH YEET pick up a sword BOOM you just started a quest pick up a phoenix egg BOOOM you just started.... well I guess ended a quest but hey that's for you to find out. The quest system is pretty regular compared to most quest systems BUT GUESS WHAT there is no back and forth quest EX: Hey you send this letter to queen stupid face so she can send me back and equally useless letter so I can send her back another and another etc... This game Has NON of the thankfully also you can get a quest from animals these Devs were on like weed or something when making this game because some of the quests are AMAZING there was one where I had to kill a chicken. [Quest System and shizz 10/10] amazing overall.  Conclusion - This game is a must buy for D&D players strategy players and also starters it is well optimized and loading is like zipping fast but in some areas, they do throw a lot at you so be wary of that, and if the game is on sale it's even MORE worth it. So it's a Buy. [This Game is a 9/10 With a Badass seal of approval]  Quick shizz:  Cons - Kinda repetitive at times/story can lead you astray in the last part /  Pros - Good combat / Replayable / Great sound design / Awesome music / Good effects or graphics / Gorry / Charm / Fun even if you don't have friends :D (like me ;-; )."
Ragefighter,278,1,1,August 18,Recommended,437.1,"I accidently murdered at least half of the people in Fort Joy And I dropped a ""Painting of Alexander"" on one of my ""off-duty"" characters by mistake... I am off to a great start!  I really wish I could revive that party member :'( I think I got a little greedy when I decided to muel up one of my guys with all the valubles from the interior of the fort then used quick travel and some telekinesis to get stuff over to the blacksmith.  Poor blacksmith decided to start walking as I moved a chest closer in and instantly died :(  So I loaded up here belongings into said chest and headed to the Kitchen and this time VERY carefully moved it close enough to sell everything not needed to those NPC's.    All in all, I made quite a *killing* over in that zone.  But at what cost?!   I also learned that dropping stuff on people kills them... I believe it only works with very heavey stuff like a chest full of junk or those HUGE paintings.  And I honestly did not want to kill all those people via Wizard of Oz style house falling on them.

Zero Summ,684,1,0,"November 6, 2017",Recommended,140.6,"Pros:One of the best co-op experiences I've ever played. Assuming you're playing with a patient, like-minded group. Amazing story. Well crafted characters. Decisions feel like they actually have weight. The story and characters have just the right amount of silly. It is both serious and fun at the same time. Revamped combat. I love the new physical/magic armor system. Status effects aren't as overpowered as they were in the first game (They're still insanely good.) AI. It's brutally efficient. Most of the time. Beautiful graphics engine, with all the expected graphical options. I believe all the dialog has a voice over, and the acting is excellent. The animals with human voices are especially hilarious. (Using the Pet Pal talent.) Reasonably priced at $45. No Loot Boxes/Season Passes/Micro-Transactions. If they put out and old-school style expansion pack I'd buy it in a heartbeat. Origin characters are a great addition over the first game. It adds a ton of replayability. GM Mode is amazing. You could run a full D&D campaign over the internet with your friends using this tool. Dev team is still very active in fixing bugs. An instant classic, right up there with Baldur's Gate. Steam Workshop supports adds a ton of content to the game. Neutral:Running the game two player with the Lone Wolf talent is super unbalanced. I'm kind of enjoying it though. Above level 5 or 6 Lone Wolf makes tactician mode feel like normal mode. That being said the very beginning of the game on tactician is really rough with only two people. The game is still kind of linear, but nowhere near as bad as the first game. Cons:If you're playing this game as a four person group, progressing through the storyline can sometimes feel like herding cats. Scholar tag seems overly important. Make sure you have at least one character in your party with it. There are several quests that require you to have it in order to finish. Armor scaling gets out of hand past the early teen levels. Picked up items being automatically added to your hotbars. Polymorph skills that add additional skills automatically added to hotbars. Can't fix this without using a mod, and I don't want to disable my achievements.

Original Sin's writing was well-executed, but the game felt like a slapstick cartoon far too often for my tastes. A comedy game that I didn't find that funny wasn't what I was really looking for, and so I wound up losing interest in the first.  But this. Ye gods, this. Much improved.  Sure, talking to animals is still funny, but the game spends a hell of a lot less time laughing at people, and a lot more time being compelling. I'm invested in these characters, this world. I actually care what happens in Rivellon. The pregen/companion characters are lovely, the dialog keyword system is a blast, the (surprise) voice acting is *really good*, and the combat and gameplay seems to have evolved in some interesting ways.   I'll update this if relevant as I continue to play, but as of now? I'm estatic with this game.  Planning to try some co-op; I'll let you know how that goes if I do."

I can't write one of those hyper-detailed ""very useful"" reviews, but:  1) the entire game is hand crafted with great detail and care. Everything has had a great deal of thoughtful effort put into it.  2) there is a LOT of it. This a long and content-filled game. You can rush through it much faster if you want, or spend time to see it all.  3) graphics are great, actually beautiful, detailed and rich  4) voice acting is top quality, and the game is fully voiced  5) the environment is very open-ended. You can pick up virtually everything. Furniture, barrels full of oil, I'm currently taking a variety of paintings off the walls because I expect some kind of player stronghold later on.

Ziles,210,1,0,"December 13, 2017",Recommended,68.3,"Never played the first, but I've been loving everything about this so far. I've always enjoyed the style of game that feels pseudo pen-and-paper D&D (Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, etc.). But with those, and even D&D itself, I have a similar gripe with special moves and spells, which tend to work on a very limited, ""x uses per day"" system. Divinity 2 has a similar feel to those kinds of games, but most abilities and spells have a turn cooldown.  Also, where the default in those other games mentioned was real-time with options to pause on triggers, or to manually pause and unpause, combat in this is solely turn-based. Battles tend to feel a lot more strategic as a result. Also a bit chaotic, as elemental effects get thrown across the field all the time. The important thing to note is that all of your characters are likely to get set on fire or be poisoned in most battles. It's inevitable.  I haven't played multiplayer, but it's been great playing single player because of the character stories. A full party of 4, and I'm really wanting to know more about all the pre-made characters. While you can make a fully custom character, I recommend playing the first time with one of the characters that has a backstory. It's really adding to the lore to have a character with a much more fleshed out backstory than I'm used to seeing in these kinds of games, and it's been adding another layer of fun to not just roleplay, but try to roleplay my character (in dialog, you'll get prompts for why a certain option is choosable, and you'll sometimes have your character's name next to an option to show it's choosable because of their backstory, which I don't think you'd get if you made a fully custom character).  If you've enjoyed other cRPGs then all I can say is two thumbs up -- would recommend."

HadesWTF,99,1,0,"December 22, 2017",Recommended,111.0,"It's a long game, but a good game. II just finished my first playthrough at 110 hours. I didn't complete EVERY quest but I did come to some sort of resolution for most of them. Divinity Original Sin 2 is a rich and beautiful world to explore with an explosive and exciting turn based combat system. The game has a very intersting story that is 99% voiced which goes a long way in immersing you into this world. I never knew that I needed games like this to be voiced and to have a narrator. Take note Pillars of Eternity 2. It gives you this sense of going on a real Dungeons and Dragons style adventure. It conjures up feelings of Baulder's Gate 2 while being very modern and engaging. This is the divinitive CRPG experience in gaming today. I firmly believe it will be a classic like the CRPGs of old.   The game isn't without it's flaws though. Firstly the last two acts slog a bit. There are still tons of interesting things that happen and a few jaw-dropping moments, but some parts I struggled to boot my PC up and play the game. This comes right into the second flaw, the game is a little too long. You definitely get your money's worth. This game would give you good value per dollar even if it cost $100, and it only cost $45 US. It's a freaking steal. However, when it takes 100+ hours to beat a game while seeing most of it's content sometimes you just burn out a bit. Finally there are some flaws with the actual gameplay a few times. Some of the puzzles are unecessarily difficult, sometimes it feels like the enemy gets 10 turns for every 1 turn you get, and it has performance issues in a few spots.   However, overall this game is the best game of 2017. It's an absolute steal at $45 and the game tells you a story you won't soon forget. Easy reccomendation to anyone even slightly interested in CRPGs."

You can get totally stuck trying to beat a battle scenario, but then with one ah-ha moment it becomes clear and rewarding. Oh so rewarding!

Kodlaken,178,1,0,"October 14, 2017",Recommended,36.3,"First I want to talk about the character creation, I found it a bit annoying to navigate and felt it would have been much better if everything was on one screen instead of multiple screens, Fallout 2 did this well, you can increase your main attributes and pick and choose skills/traits, all on one screen. The creation itself is pretty standard, pick your preset ""class"" although you can choose which abilities you want to start with, your preset will determine the pool of abilities you get, if you choose a rogue you get rogue abilities, if you choose a summoner, you get summoner abilities. The talents in this game are absolutely terrible, there are 1-2 amazing ones, 3-4 decent ones and the rest are pretty crappy and not worth picking up. Stuff like hothead, which gives you 10% accuracy and 10% critical chance, this is pretty insignificant but you know whatever its decent I guess but oh wait it is only at full health, and if you don't know, this game's combat is pretty much all about having poison and fire and all kinds of stuff happening on the battlefield, your characters will almost definitely be on fire or poisoned, it is pretty much impossible to avoid it from happening, and while your healer(s) will probably be able to keep you topped up, it just seems not worth the effort for such a small buff.  I now want to start talking about how fun the combat is, I started as a rogue and it was pretty boring to start with but as I progressed and my party progressed I was able to cast tons of different abilities and spells to change the battlefield to something that is advantageous to me. For example, I started as an undead, and being a rogue I just blinked on-top of the enemy and dropped poison at my feet, this allowed me to gain a small amount of healing and also damage the enemy, but that is just a very small advantage. You can mix elements to totally screw with your enemies, you can drop some rain down (this makes them wet) and then just use an aoe chill spell and this will freeze everybody and they will be helpless for a turn, allowing you to bash their heads in. And later on you gain the ability to change these elements even more, but that is somewhat spoilerific so I will refrain from going into details on that. Not only is it really fun strategizing how you are going to fight in battles, but every spell looks amazing and the game in general looks spectacular.  The quests in this game are excellent, there are no generic ""kill 20 goblins and bring me their toenails"" quests which makes you look forward to the next quest you will run into, everything is voiced, which you wouldn't really expect from a game that has so many different outcomes in dialogue in and out of quests. The voice acting is very good I would say, besides the NPC dialogue you will regularly hear the narrator talk, and he has a very good voice, they did a good job of making you feel like you were in the moment experiencing everything, the great descriptive writing allows you to close your eyes and picture whatever the narrator is talking about. Something I quite like is how your character creation changes NPC dialgoue, most NPC's will reward you in some way for simply being their race, some characters are seemingly racist and despise elves or dwarves (these characters are usually not involved in quests so you don't miss out on anything). There are also some NPC's that reward you in some way for having certain Character Tags, a soldier will relate to another soldier which increases relation with them, this gives a discount when trading with them which helps a bit. The game really feels as though you would have had a completely different outcome in a quest for simply having changed 1 or 2 things in character creation. It makes you eager to finish the game and restart as a totally different character and hear all of the dialogue you totally missed the first time around.  That mostly concludes my thoughts on the game, just gonna put some arbitrary numbers here.  -Gameplay 4/5 The combat is extremely fun and challenging too albeit a tad annoying when you take on too many enemies and wonder why you are incapable of winning.  -Story/Quests 4/5 All of the quests I have done I enjoyed and I look forward to seeing how the story of my character progresses once I leave the Island.  -Graphics 4/5 Not absolutely mindblowing but definitely looks good.  Overall I would say the game is very good, one of the best RPG's I have played in my life and I haven't even beaten it yet. I look forward to the rest of the game, I put 30 hours into just the first zone of the game, so I hope the rest of the game has the same amount of content and I will easily see 200 hours worth of content in this game depending on how thoroughly you play through each quest and explore everything."
Dru,96,1,0,"December 15, 2017",Recommended,154.9,"Amazing and very promising game. As it prequel, Divinity Original Sin 1, it is an awesome, interesting and funny game.   I really liked that they had different options for player who prefers the story over the combat or vice versa. I personally prefer the rol part over the combat, so this was a welcomed surprise for me. The combat system, turn based, is in my opinion a smart choice they made. A refreshing touch after all the more 'action' based RPGS, like Skyrim. You can really plan a strategy and take your time to give orders to your characters. Or you can ignore combat and focus on the story. I loved the graphics the locations are beautiful, and I really enjoyed that they were not the typical ‚ÄòEuropean medieval forest‚Äô type but rather deserts or tropical islands. I loved that this time we were able to play as different species (I played as the Red Prince) and specially that you could chose a premade character or a new one (with any option for species/sex/race etc). I really liked that the ‚Äònon chosen characters‚Äô end up being your companions. It is something that I always wanted from the first Dragon Age. Every character had a very specific personality and very interesting backstories, the same as a very funny banter.  I would only complain about the lack of lore connecting this game with the others in the Divinity Series. I found it a little bit confusing, specially regarding the first Divine divinity. I would only complain about many parts of the game still being bug (like many quests and some characters like Fane). This was disappointing but I hope that will improve with further patches.  In my opinion it is one of the most addictive and fun games that I played lately."
Pat Real,97,1,0,February 25,Recommended,255.0,"Everything that made the first game amazing, with the fat cut and a ton of new stuff. I loved the story, the detailed graphics, the wonderful voice acting, the music that has only improved from the incredible soudtracks of the other Divinity games, the new gameplay mechanics and skills, and just about everything. The annoying ""skill tier"" system of the last game has been greatly downplayed by the memory stat, meaning the only limit to what skills you can use are slots to equip them in. The combat has been improved by enemies who teleport themselves and you, inflict status effects, and generally act a lot smarter than the last game. I found the tactic of ""start a big fire and teleport anyone who tries to escape back into the fire"" that made short work of most enemies in the last game uneffective here, and that made combat more dynamic. Everyone now has physical and magical defense which guard against not only health loss but status effects, so it may become necessary to recover someones magic armor if you know the enemy might charm you. There are dozen of examples like this. There are plenty of standard skills like fire, warrior, necromancy etc but the one that really stood out to me was polymorph. Spread wings and fly around the battlefield or turn enemies into helpless chickens or grow bull horns and charge enemies from great distance. There are so many great skill combos and plenty of tricky enemies to use them on. I honestly believe this game will go down as one of the greatest RPGs of all time along greats like Deus Ex and Baldur's Gate. It offers the same level of freedom in quest design, combat, and story that all the greats do. I have heard a lot of games like Mario Kart referred to as ""friendship ruiners"" and this game is the exact opposite. Its fun solo sure but if you have a nerdy friend or spouse or whoever, this game will be a great bonding excercise. It supports controllers in a smooth satisfying way for such a complex game. I look forward to another chapter of this fantastic series and an eventual console port so I can buy and enjoy this masterpiece all over again"
Really Tight Ear Muffs,63,1,0,"December 15, 2017",Recommended,177.5,"I highly recommend this game! I have almost 100 hours into this game and they've been a GOOD 100 hours. The most surprising part of this game is that the story is good. You have to make serious decisions that can have lasting ramifications on the game. The story is great, but the game play is also great. Mind you, it's pretty hard. Just when you feel like you're doing really well, the enemies ramp up and get harder. So this is a pretty challenging game, but it's also very satisfying.  I really enjoy the different builds and the ability to reset your character. That means that if you get bored with a play style or run into a really difficult section, you can respec. As soon as I beat it, I will likely play through it again as a lone wolf.   There were a few bugs that I ran into, but reloading and doing something else first would fix it. For example, if interacting with a certain object causes the game to crash, travel to another area, do some trading, then come back. Or use a different character.   I have only two major complaints. The first is inventory management. Moving things around is tedious. I like having the Wares system, which is where you can move an item into this category called ""Wares"", then sell all your wares at once to a vendor. Saves time with the vendor, but not placing them into wares. I also had my strength hero be the pack mule. So I'd have to move the item to the Red Prince, then right click and move to wares. Tedious, but manageable.   The second complaint is the persuasion system. It seemed like I failed literally every persuasion attempt for the first half of the game. I gave up on making it work. See, I would see an Intelligence-based persuasion attempt and would say, ""Ok, I'll use my dude who has maxed intelligence."" FAIL. What the heck?! Turns out that not only do you need high intelligence, you need high persuasion, which is a stat you can level up. Later, when I had more points to spare, I maxed out persuasion on two characters, one finesse based, one int based. That way, I always have someone who can win that persuasion. It was minor and I was able to live with failing literally every persuasion attempt.   Anyway, I give this game a 9/10. The only reason I don't give it a 10/10 is because my summoner can't have more than one summon out at a time! I want to summon my spirit wolf, summon my incarnate, and summon a bone widow from my summoner main! But alas, you can only have one summon out at a time.   BUY THIS GAME"

The combat is exceptional, it lets you approach a combat situation from multiple angles, environmental interaction is wide and vary, and percise usage of skills is critical to controlling the battlefield. The story is entertaining, and every side mission you happend upon is either hilarious or contributes to the lore of the world  with great voice acting for every major/minor NPC (even the animals are voiced and some will even give you questlines). Finally the environment of the game itself is gorgeous, ad the amount of detail that the developers have put into this game only gives it a more immersive feel as you explore the game.

WinterScout,194,1,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,683.4,"Divinity Original Sin 2 was the first game of the Divine games that I had tried / pickup and really enjoyed myself when getting through the game and making progress with my original party. From my personal experience, DOS 2 offers unique ways to solve different quests while also being punishing if you screw it up and not letting you get a retry button (unless you reload a save). From the character selection to the origin characters, divinity has a very vast variety of options to choose for your characters skills, do you want to be a tanky mage? or how about being an rogue who can polymorph enemies into chickens. When you get into the game after making a custom character or choosing one of the six origin characters, you are able to pick up to three other origin characters to recruit into your party and journey along together till you reach your end goal. What sets this game differently from an RPG like skyrim or fallout is that you actually get to do side quest for your companions and are able to learn more about him or her through dialog, not having bland reused dialog changing with the envoirment and how they see you as an ally or an enemy depending on if you're being rude to them. On top of all of that another part that I enjoy is that all most all dialog (except some that have been added recently to put players in the right direction and some that are just bugged) are 100% voice acted, from the Red Prince to a dog in Fort Joy each entity has its own character and appeal to them. One thing that makes divinity shine from most RPGs is that you can physically kill any NPC you want, from entire towns to some of Fort Joys residence (But killing origin characters will cause problems with the main story line so avoid doing so) allowing you to kill a trading that you might have a grudge over if you want some of their loot from their store. Finally the loot system is extravagant allowing you to have different loot while looting dungeons in different play throughs based on Lucky Charm and loot tables that were generated in the game, while also not completely dropping the NPC's inventory if killed making it more useful to pickpocket them for their better wears before killing. Overall I love DOS 2 as a game, it personally has to be one of my favorite games released this year, should you pay $45? Yes this game is worth every cent the COOP is amazing and the story and side quest will have your save be longer than 40 hours or more depending on if you go into the nitty gritty."
FunkyBuddha,167,1,0,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,63.7,"The game starts a little rough/boring when you're on the ship (I did not like it at all), but after that short area the game slowly opens up and before you know it you have been absorbed into it. The attention to detail (all animals are voiced but you only talk to them if you spend a point on the required ability), the flexibility that your abilities come with opens up many options for battles and exploration that is mostly limited by your imagination, and the little hand holding when it comes to exploration (you must talk and explore around instead of waiting for ! marks and waypoints) allows for a greater immersion. I got this game not expecting much outside of a regular RPG, but what I got was an old school DnD-esque game with a lot of depth and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me if that's not something that we haven't seen in ages. If you liked games like Baldurs Gate and the more recent Pillars of Eternity then this game will grab a hold of you and never let you go."

Larian Studios is amazing, the Classic game was enthralling and I cannot wait to play the game all over again with the Definitive upgrade. If anything, I'm upset that they denied me the chance to throw more money at them by being so awesome. Definitely a developer worth supporting, and the game is an easy 5/5."

Im not going to give you pro's and con's as I am yet to find anything bad to say about this game.  Graphic: Fantastic Gameplay: Deep & Rich Replayability: Excessive! Story: Enjoyable/Entertaining Game Stability: Not a single bug/crash to date Audio: Beyond words (littereally) Customisation: Whatever the hell you feel like! Play Styles: Depends on your mood at the time.  A fully voiced game with a amazing musical soundtrack.  Rich and detailed lore brings the world to life.  A huge amount of skills and items to customise your party... or your lone wolf character (who needs a party right?).  You dont need to have played Divinity: Original Sin to enjoy this game as it is set hundreds of years later, but youll get a little extra lore out of it if you have.  As I said, I cant recommend this game enough.  So far this ones my GOTY 2017.  9.8/10  (Because nothing in life is a perfect 10)"
alex_jbright,265,1,0,October 22,Recommended,137.6,"In a league of it's own. Played through in single player and co-op, both are very enjoyable. A very unique pool of spells and abilities to choose from as well as the ability to re-spec and tweak at will when I mess up one of my characters.  Good story progression throughout the acts, hard sometimes to recall characters and plot points from previous acts but the journal is very in depth and makes up for this."

If you enjoy sandbox-style freedom in an RPG (like in Skyrim), you will enjoy this game too.  If you enjoy intricate games that have countless possibilities, like a Dungeons and Dragons game, you will love this game.  Honestly, the only gripe I've experienced/heard people have with the game is the difficulty (which can be remedied by deflating one's ego and simply lowering the difficulty)  This game is a true masterpiece."

This game took the apple that God told Adam and Eve not to eat, and ate it whole, then returned to the tree cut it down and made a apple tree pie of Godlyness. Otherwords, this game broke the mold of how a game should be made. If 1/10th of game developers would take note of this masterpiece games might start improving. This game is the equivalint of busting 5 nuts at the same time, while eating your favorite food, sitting on the most comfortable chair ever made. Thee amount of little details put into this game show that finally ... FINALLY a company put the time, blood, sweat and tears into thier product and produced gold. They go above and beyond what a games standard should be. I honestly would like to meet every person who contributed to making this game, shake their hand and bow down at their feet.

johnny.killstring,513,1,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,112.7,"Kickstarter backer, played about an hour or three of early access.  A couple hours into this game and I findi it to be an improvement in pretty much every regard. Most specifically, in the writing and the tone. Original Sin's writing was well-executed, but the game felt like a slapstick cartoon far too often for my tastes. A comedy game that I didn't find that funny wasn't what I was really looking for, and so I wound up losing interest in the first.  But this. Ye gods, this. Much improved.  Sure, talking to animals is still funny, but the game spends a hell of a lot less time laughing at people, and a lot more time being compelling. I'm invested in these characters, this world. I actually care what happens in Rivellon. The pregen/companion characters are lovely, the dialog keyword system is a blast, the (surprise) voice acting is *really good*, and the combat and gameplay seems to have evolved in some interesting ways.   I'll update this if relevant as I continue to play, but as of now? I'm estatic with this game.  Planning to try some co-op; I'll let you know how that goes if I do."

Gubby,36,1,0,"October 23, 2017",Recommended,88.1,"Dude. Seriously. This game is worth every penny.  Do you like DnD, Pathfinder, or any type of table top game and wish you could just play it as a video game? Well this one is the closest and best option you're going to find. This game is so good and your intelligence is actually important for once in a video game. This game makes you think and genuinely has a difficulty setting that challenges the player. Too many games nowadays make their games for casuals, which don't this game still has an option for, but the combat feels so good especially when you're playing on tactician and actually have to think.  The visuals are amazing in this game, the combat is so in depth. The mechanics and animations are very fluid and make you able to become much more immersed in the game.  I love exploring every corner of the map and finding the smallest and most interesting. Easily the best game of the year, and I genuinely mean that. Even if you're not into turn based games, this game is worth your time. The face that every character is voice acted, and every box you open is there for a reason, it makes you feel like the developers actually put effort into their game and cared about creating a real and genuine game for you to play.   You MUST have this in your steam library if you claim to be a gamer. This is going to change the way developers make games forever. This will be a staple. This is Divinity Original Sin 2, best game of 2017."

Tritotamar,79,1,0,April 18,Recommended,93.8,"I'm just going to copy-paste my review of 1 here and amend the parts that have changed, overall this is basically the exact same game as the first with a different story.    This game varies wildly between really great and confusingly terrible.  Good:  -The combat is amazing and the ways you interact with the world are interesting and sometimes novel. -There are some pretty fun / interesting / unique puzzles. -The voice acting is pretty good. (except anything involving goblins, they obnoxiously hiss all their s's) There are few enough of them now that it isn't a problem.  Bad  -Inventory management is a nightmare. I'm pretty sure it was made to be as obtuse as possible, which is a problem when you're contantly getting buried under garbage you need to sift through. This has been improved, but it's still tedious.  -The puzzles that aren't good (most of them) are really awful. They are either ridiculously tedious or obtuse, or both. The devs apparently thought that searching rooms pixel by pixel to find tiny camouflaged buttons is fun gameplay. It is not fun gameplay. It happens all the goddamn time.  This is absolutely still the case, some of the puzzles are goddamn idiotic and will absolutely destroy your immersion and enjoyment. Pixel hunts are much less common at least.   -The difficulty curve is strange.  The first main zone (levels 3 through ~9) is far harder than the rest of the game, and is capped off by a boss that is frankly complete ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t.   Difficulty curve is still real frontloaded, but the bigger problem is accidentally wandering into encounters that are 2 to 3 levels higher than the one you're supposed to go to because they were closer, and the game wasn't clear about the order you're expected to do things in.   - Every once in a while the game will just instantly kill you in a way you couldn't reasonably have expected. This isn't a huge problem since quicksaves are fast and easy but it's still frustrating.   This doesn't happen anymore as far as I can tell.   -So much running. So much of your time in this game will just be spent running through places you've already been.    The game has great combat but everything that isn't the combat tends to be tedious garbage or trying to figure out what the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• the game wants you to do because it never bothered to tell you.  Pretty mediocre on average but it does enough different and there are enough fun and unique moments that it's worth trying out. (It's long as hell though so set aside some time. One playthrough took me 55 hours.)"

ventzz,24,1,0,June 13,Recommended,126.8,"Absolutely fantastic. An immersive experience, filled with different possibilities, choices and paths, it's amazing how many ways there are so you can achieve a particular goal. At first glance, I expected something Diablo-like, but what I got was even better. You can play the lone wolf, sure, but if you do opt for a party, the characters are not to disappoint you in any aspect, as their backstories and goals are most captivating and make you actually care for what happens with them. Combine that with the great effort put into the voice acting(the accents make it even better) and interacting with other characters becomes a joy. The soundtrack itself is also surprisingly good and when Impish Pocket Realm(or Quirky Bones) first played, I fell in love. tl;dr; This game came out as a HUGE surprise to me, for I discovered it by accident and wasn't expecting it to be nearly as entertaining. If you do like RPGs, do yourself a favour and be sure to check this one out, it's absolutely worth it."

Storyline is complex and multi dimensional. Battle is difficult but, due to the turn based format, tactical choices matter. You can get totally stuck trying to beat a battle scenario, but then with one ah-ha moment it becomes clear and rewarding. Oh so rewarding!

Moustachio'ED,40,1,0,February 25,Recommended,52.1,"The game itself is great and a true continuation and development of all that was loved and praised about the first Original Sin; however, and it's a big however, the engine is buggy as hell.  There's an odd core usage issue which means that multi core cpus are not utilized and the game dumps everything onto a single core - notice the strange frame skip stutter when panning?  That's a core usage issue and nothing else.  It seems the devs either don't care to fix the issue or can't fix the issue, which means one has to set the processor affinity to a single core and then back to all cores in task manager every single time one plays the game.  Not cool.  So if they sort that out, it's a highly recommended game; if not, it's still recommended but be prepared to tune your system every playthrough.  Oh yes, also there are issues with overclocked CPUs and GPUs.  Come on Larian, get your technical issues as sorted out as you've gotten the combat in this game."

‚ùÄ Nes ‚ùÄ,142,1,0,August 25,Recommended,155.4,"Let me start off by saying that I don't normally write reviews for games unless they are exceptional. This game lies in one of the few exceptions where I have to.  I bought this game when it first released but I didn't have a good computer to actually fully enjoy it. Fast forward to recently when I did buy one and I fully spent the time to play this game. At first, it seemed difficult for me as I never played the first Divinity and tried to learn my way around the game. Not that long after, I got familiar with the story and the lore. From someone who doesn't enjoy care about the plot of most RPG's or MMORPG's, this game somehow brought the story forward for me to be interested in. I personally built an attatchment to my character and my companions as we continued on this adventure through Divinity. It was an amazing experience and that was when I knew what a gem this game was.  Some of the elements that I found compelling about this game was:   The voice acting - The many actors who portrayed the characters in this game did not disappoint. At times, I was just shocked at the amount of emotion and passion placed into each line of dialogue. My personal favorite was the voice actor for Lohse, whom I felt went above and beyond what some would just skim past. Also a big round of applause to those actors who put themselves out there to voice each animal or dungeon rat that was available throughout the game.   The combat - The understanding of many tactical aspects of each combat situation made it harrowing for me, in a fun sort of way. It was fun to experiment different strategies to clear a particular room of enemies or be faced with decisions that could affect whether or not my party makes it out of combat alive. The high-ground/low-ground system made it particularly mindful to pay attention to your surroundings while the natural elemental occurences (such as oil, poison, fire, etc,) keep you on your toes.   The storytelling - As stated in the above paragraph, the story is phenomenal. I found myself always wondering what would happen next and how my actions would affect the world down the line. It was truly one of the times where I found myself relating to my character, as if I were them rather than me controlling them. I truly loved the way the world was set up and how mostly everything had some role to play either in the narrative of the story or just to contribute to the feel of the world.   The world - Speaking of the feel of the world, everything was how it should be to establish a world that felt dynamic and alive. NPC's truly made their experiences feel real with some having problems that seemed normal and how they were portrayed. I sometimes imagined the theoretical lives of these NPC's and treated them as if they were real people with their own past experiences. When a game can make you engrossed into their world, you know it is good.   Music - The music was excellent at many areas and shifts according to the environment that you were placed in. Dungeons or naturally spooky areas had a feeling of dread but the suspensful and harrowing music helped contribute to the feel of this.  The music that played during the ending fight actually had me tearing up as even though it was something that I heard so many times, knowing that this was final area made it truly special and evoked a lot of memories and emotions of the overall adventure   Overall, I had just finished my first campaign and am planning on finishing more as to learn more about the companions that I did not choose at first and to see all the possible routes that I can go through before I eventually clear up the game. The game's amazing and a big thanks for Larian Studios for putting out such a masterpiece. I can't wait for the Definitive Edition to come out but until then, there are many mods and more to keep you continuously entertained. 10/10"

angryhamster,17,1,0,August 27,Recommended,138.9,"I don't ever do reviews normally because I always think, why the heck would anyone be interested in what you've got to say?! lol! But this is how strongly I feel about this game!   A bit about me ('cos hey this is what you came to read right?! Nah, I just thought if you're like me you might enjoy this game too) I'm a 37 yr old female gamer and I love games ranging from GTA:V, Mass Effect, Battlefield, CoD, The Elder Scrolls Online, Skyrim, Dishonoured, God of War, The Witcher 3, Final Fantasy to Stardew Valley, Command and Conquer, Tropico etc, as well as all the retro Nintendo classics on NES, SNES, N64 and Gamecube etc.  So I've got a pretty eclectic mix of games I like, and I'm definitely not a gaming pro, more a casual gamer who just happens to get absolutely addicted to great games!  I stumbled on this one day browsing my queue and I'm beyond happy I did.  I actually think the storyline's ten times better than Skyrim (and boy do I loooooove Skyrim!).  The graphics are stunning and the music is so on point it's unreal. I've sank over 130 hrs into DOS:2 and if I didn't work full-time for a living I'd have probably sank in triple that amount, this is how engaging I've found it so far!   From having played games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights back in the day, DOS:2 immediately caught my eye as I fancied a nostalgia trip.... but damn it was SO much more than that! The narration is brilliantly engaging, witty and fantastically acted, and the love that Larian have put into building their characters backstories is blindingly obvious and unparalleled.  There's so much depth in there and it's so well padded out that I honestly can't fault it in the slightest.  Larian just became one of my favourite studios and I wish I'd known about DOS:2 when they were securing funding over on Kickstarter, because hell yeah I would have backed them!  The only thing I struggled with to begin with was the difficulty, in that modern games tend to spoon feed us tidbits and tips on what we should be doing in a game, they're full of map-markers and quest highlights on the map etc. specifically guiding us to the people and places we need to see, the tasks we need to do.  DOS:2 on the other hand demands that you think on your feet and outside the box! Sure it has a journal function with your quests loosely written in (actually in a journal format though), but it's absolutely down to you to work out how to accomplish that quest and there's zero hand holding.  But to be honest with you, it's actually something I've come to love about this game, for once it's a game that actually really requires to start using your brain, otherwise you're going to miss key elements of a fantastic story.  Enough waffling from me, just do yourself a favour and if you love RPGs of any kind, buy this! - I'm over 130 hrs in and I'm on Act 4 already looking forward to my next play through!"

I've been on the fence about buying this game for a while, I finally picked up this game on sale and I'm so far 17 hours into playing this game. All I can say is this may be the greatest RPG I have ever played. Does it have the greatest graphics? No. It is mouse click controls as opposed to WASD. This game more than makes up for all of that with the richness of it's story and lore. In additition the character customization as well as the sheer amount of decisions you can make to complete a quest are vast and astounding. For a game that is not that graphics intense it is still 26 GB and you can see where all that memory goes. You can talk to every single NPC and animal (if you have that skill) in this world and they all have a voice you can actually listen to. You can kill any NPC you want but keep in mind that everything has a consequence in this game. Combat is interesting and again, depending on what skills you have, can be approached in multiple ways depending on the challenge. You can be a ranger with wings, fly up to the high ground and have a tactical advantage. Have a battlemage, shock the most powerful foe, stun lock him while the rest of your party kills all the others. Be a rogue and give every enemy the suprise buttsecks.... everything is a possibility in this game. If you have looked at the game description and been intrigued but maybe not convinced to buy this game, don't even think about it just buy it. You will get your money's worth. This is a game I see myself replaying multiple times in the future."

I recently tried playing Warhammer II and it was so sluggish - i know it's apples and oranges, but i didn't want to spend $2k upgrading my machine.

Gulthor,136,1,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,208.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is an isometric computer RPG in the tradition of old-school pen & paper RPGs (such as Dungeons & Dragons) brought to the digital age.  In DOS2, you'll take on the role of one of six characters (or create one of your own) to explore, interact with friends and foes through interesting dialogue options, and engage in tactical turn-based combat encounters.  Whether you build your own character or play through the story of one of the six Origin characters, you'll be able to fully customize your character by choosing skills, assigning attributes, and picking talents that all synergize to make interesting and unique builds that change your options for interacting with the environment, with NPCs, and in combat.  As you play, you'll recruit the aid of up to three other characters (chosen either from the remaining available Origin characters or hired from a mercenary captain), but be warned; while choosing to travel with fellow Origin characters will open up new and interesting storylines to explore, your goals will sometimes be at odds. Like your main character, you'll also be able to customize your companions, creating a party that can stand up to the challenges that await you.   Alternatively, play with up to three additional players, and explore Rivellon together in jolly cooperation.  Although DOS2 is not procedurally-generated, and encounters are placed and not random, the choices you make and actions you take have long-term consequences that can dramatically alter your play experience, but in a way that feels surprisingly natural - even intended!  DOS2 is complex, and what seems intimidating to start quickly becomes a deep and engaging experience that both challenges you mechanically and drives you on to experience more and more of the story it has to offer."

Katz,193,1,0,"December 13, 2017",Recommended,179.1,"One of the best RPGs I have ever played, Divinity: Original Sin 2 truly is a work of art. From character creation to waking up in the prologue, the player will experience a familiar and welcoming feeling similar to creating a character for a tabletop RPG. This is pen-and-paper put into video game form in the truest sense.   Character creation is simple, and handled rather well. Though there is a slight lack in customization where one must choose face x through y and skin color x through y. Although the amount of races to choose is actually impressive. Alternatively, rather than playing a custom character, the player can experience the story from the perspective of one of the six, well-written, story characters. The races are vast and different in their own right with Human, Lizard, Dwarf, Elf, and Undead to choose from. They each face their own difficulties but all have unique boons or bonuses. Each class is just a combination of skills, a preset of gear and skills to start the player off with as customization and 'build-your-own' is heavily emphasized soon after the prologue. The player even has a choice to select a pseudo-background for their customized character of anything between a noble, mystic or barbarian with plenty more to be earned through the Roleplay elements.  Combat is very in-depth and ties in well with character customization. Skill trees and the skills, themselves, interract with the world differently in, sometimes, unexpected ways. The way combat feels is amazing, satisfying as it is turn-based combat done well. Abilities and spells, positioning, and the wide range of items make it one of the best features in this game, though one that is difficult to master. Spells can set the ground ablaze, clouds of poison can be created, and a combination of thing A and thing B can create explosions, electrified hallways, and giant spiders made of bone. Feedback, something important for combat, feels good. Powerful spells feel powerful and two-handed weapons feel weighty and hit hard. An overall enjoyable experience.  For those less combat-savvy, there is always the option to talk yourself out of a situation. The Rp elements are some of the finest done that I have seen in recent years. Skyrim has nothing on this. Each conversation and attempt at persuasion can change the experience of playing through the game. Accidentally anger a skeleton? Talk her to death- Yes, that was a thing that happened. Got caught stealing? Convince them otherwise! Need help solving a theft? Talk to a rat! The conversations and interractions with NPCs around the world are some of the best I've ever seen. From sad tales of a family lost to the hilarity of a cow attempting to tell your future. Or, simply murder them all if you can. There is freedom here that is just waiting to be explored.  On top of all of this, however, is the fact that this game has a co-operative feature of up to four players. Each player can choose to create a customized character or take the role of one of the story characters. While it is set up for an enjoyable single-player game, the ability to enjoy the full game with friends or family is also very welcome. The party is able to split up completely and roam the world if desired. There are also ways to troll your friends by Dying poison red, and giving it to them as a gift. Or, of course, you can all become Heroes.  The storytelling in this game is deep and rich as is player choice and freedom. The combat system is well thought out and satisfying. Even the character creation, simple as it is, gives the player more freedom than in most games to change almost everything stat-wise. It is easy to see that this game is made with love, and the developers have shown it clearly enough through this game that I regret not being able to support it on kickstarter. I cannot recommend this game enough. It is a gem and a must-have, even if you are not a fan of turn-based strategy games. This is, first and foremost, an RPG. If you have ever played D&D, Pathfinder, or any other table-top game then Divinity: Original Sin 2 is for you."

noot,610,1,1,"December 29, 2017",Recommended,95.0,"tl;dr:  Divinity OS2 is one of the best RPG's and one of the best Co-Op games out right now, and quite possibly the best game I have played in years.  A friend of mine got me this game as a Christmas gift, and I have not been able to put it down since. I enjoyed Divinity OS1 before, but this game manages to outdo it in most aspects still.   The story is amazing. It truly makes you feel like every small decision you make matters, and changes both the course of the game, the way your characters personality forms and how they interact with party members and the world in general(and obviously how they react to you as well).   Most if not all dialogue is fully voiced by great voice actors(including the narrator), the sound track is atmospheric and immerses you straight into the fantasy world, and the graphics and world design are gorgeous.   When I played the OS1 for the first time the slow-paced combat kind of turned me off at first (I thought it was quite hard to survive, and kind of confusing), but once I got more into it I grew to like it, and with Divinity OS2 all my doubts about the turn based combat have vanished. It is a lot of fun to plan out your next moves with your friend. The game wants you to be creative and tactical in combat, so you better not try to run head first into every fight, or else you will probably end up dying many times.Rather you will often use the environment to your advantage( which reacts to pretty much anything you do ) applying status effects, luring enemies away to overwhelm them in numbers and combining elements with your party members to cause havoc.   The companions have rich stories, are fully voiced and quite interesting (I had a hard time picking a follower because they're all quite cool).   That's pretty much all there is to say: if you like (Old-School) RPG's and don't mind the slower paced more tactical combat system, this is probably the best game out there right now."

And like many RPGs, this game is very supportive of mods, which is something i would definitely recommend looking at if you wish to spice up the game [Note: Be aware that this will disable achievements]. The modding community is one of the best modding communities out there, opening up opportunities for new, crazy classes to choose from, increased enemy difficulty, more customisation options, different buffs and de-buffs for you, your allies and your enemies and so much more. what's more, every character has a voice, even your custom character! no more suffering from silent protangonist syndrome, your character all the freedom in the world to speak their opinions.   10/10 would recommend to anyone who like RPGs and is invested in a good story.

Hotshot,99,1,0,June 29,Recommended,177.3,"Narrative: DOS 2 has a true fantasy story. It is one steeped in mystery and pushes the boundaries of creativity.  Each character has a unique subplot completely entangled with the main story. The side quests tie in with the games central themes and main narrative very well. Accordingly, they dont seem out of place or tacked on but are very believeable in the world crafted by larian studios. Music: The music works. It sets the tone quite nicely for the various parts of the world. It goes from epic to playful to somber to tragic in parallel with the envirement or scenario. Gameplay: The gameplay is very strategic with nuanced application. You must defeat intelligent and powerful Antagonists. Your set of abilities can be used envirementaly and you must keep your wits about you for the entirety of the game for both battle and exploration.  Characters: the ensemble cast of main characters each have their own ambitions, dreams, and philosophy. They are not just along for the ride. If you dont want to play as one of them you can create a character whose complexity and depth extends as far as yourself. Most if not all of the NPCs have believable ambitions and reasons for either deterring you or assisting you. there are many factions of npcs and 2/3 of them will seek your destruction depending on your choice so replayability is permitted. I have finished this game once and this is a reflection of that experience.  Since this is truly a great game, I wish everyone to play through and experience its wonders, for that is why I recommend the exploration mode for anyone that is turned off by the difficulty, so they can focus on exploration. I say that because the world and its characters are a spectacle to behold. This is the purest Role Playing Game i have played and I look forward to the future of its developer, Larian Studios."

The high point for me is the combat with plenty of spells, many possible strategies, new aditions, and overall great action. There really aren't many flaws overall other than some rare crashes and the inventory menu that still is a little messy (right click doesn't always work as it should), but nothing game/immersion breaking.  Overall, an excellent game, you cannot miss the chance to enjoy it!"

Thalriel,160,1,0,"November 25, 2017",Recommended,493.8,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is beautiful, turn based rpg game which so delicately crafted it's not like anything I have ever played before. Character voices and narrator is so immersive you will care about and/or at least have feelings for each character you meet. You can create your own character or choose to play characters with origin story, you can customize them, well, with enough details. Characters with origin stories, however, have more questing content. Each zone is different from one another, has outstanding main and side storylines. I recommend you to complete the game with doing most of the quests and not just main story. In terms of combat, D:OS2 offers many ability schools with wide array of spells to choose from (and you can mix some spells!). Dangerous and helpful surfaces, buffs and status effects have so much effect on combat that you will need to plan your every turn with care. Also it's not the easiest game so prepare for a challenge if you choose Tactician Mode, To conclude, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the best games that came out this year and deserves your attention. Singleplayer or Multiplayer(more fun with the friends of course!), I guarantee that you will have fun."

As other people have said, it definately seems a little gold starved at lower levels, and some of the older tricks available in D:OS such as stealing paintings and the like from houses doesn't seem to be a option.  You also need to pay attention to what's going on, as with the original there is almost no hand holding in classic mode. I my case this lead to me falling back into old habbits and killing everyone that looked at me funny. Due to what appears to be an increased aggro range this has lead to most of the camp now being used to grit the path when it gets icey (i'm guessing this will come back to bite me, but it's fun anyways).

Maridian,67,1,0,October 20,Recommended,77.9,"Highly Recommended 5/5  Myself as a fan of D&D, coming from games like Baldur's Gate I & II: Shadows of Amn, Throne of Bhaal and Enhanced Edtion, IsewindDale, Pillars of Eternity, Neverwinter and many other titles this game was exceptionally good and a breath of fresh air, it is both Dynamic and Immersive, the story is deep, thrilling and intriguing, the characters are full of life and awe, even the side quests are interesting, funny, scary and powerful, the artwork and graphics are beautiful, the music is immersive, dramatic and very appropriate. The game also has a powerful way of making you think and leaves you baffled with the simplest of tasks sometimes and it's amazing how well it works as a whole.  The combat & environments are amazing and take the best of all my past D&D experiences to new levels and excels in ways other games fall short, having the ability to try any skill tree, wear any armour, use any weapon and off hand is amazing and other games i suppose just do not see the power of the possibilities it all offers, giving players the option to be and play exactly how they want to, also giving groups far more  utility and a much better role-play experience. The combat and AI combinations are amazing and synergize so well it can lead to very intense immersive battles that require good communication and well planned tactical combinations between groups to succeed.  To make things better they have incorporated the D&D experience through Game Master Mode allowing players to create their own story and encounters and battles with their own take on the D&D game similar to Tabletop Simulator but of course with a much better gameplay experience, taking things further a full workshop allowing the community to develop their own content including classes, weapons, spells, maps and much more, anything they want to create, they can.  All that together makes this game, in my opinion, the best D&D Coop/Multiplayer style Fantasy RPG of the past 10 years, I cannot find a single fault for this game I have enjoyed it immensely and its only gotten better since playing with groups and developing content for it.  BUY IT! TODAY!!"
Passionate,284,1,0,"November 3, 2016",Recommended,27.6,"Absolutely staggering amounts of customization. Beautiful graphics. Staggering amount of dialogue text. If you love D&D and classic, unforgiving RPG gameplay this game is for you. If you're more casual and want to simply experience a game where you can make limitless decisions without the frustration of punishing combat, there is an easier difficulty level (a feature this game's predecessor sorely lacked). All in all this is a fantastic game."
vestul,357,1,0,"December 23, 2016",Recommended,233.7,"Post-Release Review (Updated):  A great sequel to the first. Tactician mode seems quite a bit easier than the original, but there are enough new updates and  additions from the original to make it unique, but still feel just as smooth.  As with the first, the camera is fairly close, and it would be nice to zoom out further but it is what it is. This is pretty much the only criticism I can make. It won't hold your hand; in fact, it does the opposite. You have near-complete freedom to progress as you want and complete tons of side quests, or none at all. Tons of choice and variations in skills/classes/approaches to each situation. Make your own adventure. But buy the game.  10/10 - Game of the Year"
jimelsner,67,1,0,"February 15, 2017",Recommended,180.8,"I liked the early release a lot and have made it most of the way through the first Act in the ""easier"" explorer mode. There is one thing. Even though I have leveled up to 5, along the way, some battles are over the top...unfair. The enemies go first and frequently kill most of your team before you can even start. A good example is the one with the witch Radeka...she has many acolites that retore her and are above you and after 5 tries of no luck, I have given up on the game for now. Maybe the developers will modify these kinds of things. It is no fun to not be able to move along on a game and I have been doing this for 20 years."

Combat system is complex & fun as first D: OS game and even more tactical with new elements such as high grounds. The story & wirting is much much better, pre-made characters & companions are no longer filler dummies but REAL living characters who player will remember. Exploration is vast & full of rich contents & very enjoyable, area design is also much better than the first game which have some serious unblancing issues contentwise(huge 1st act but gets smaller & smaller). D: OS 2 really reminds me much of the old Baldur's Gate series and Dragon Age Origins. Who said that CRPG is a dead genre?  Lastly Larian should really consider making a Chinese Localization. So many Chinese players aren't that good at reading English is yarning for this game."

Rendo,75,1,0,"November 12, 2017",Recommended,289.5,"This review is somewhat limited as I have yet to fully complete the story, nor tried the dnd mode, yet I have a good idea of everything the game has to offer.   I think Larian have done a fantastic job in creating a grounded, well-rounded, and enthralling RPG. The narrative is imagnitive and captivating. Characters and npcs are unique and interesting, with good voice acting they really feel like individuals who each have their own personalilty, some could respond well to charm, others might threaten to kill you. Combat is challenging, fluid, and forces you to stay alert, using your head to figure out the best action to take. The visuals are gorgeous for the type of game it is and help to preserve the verisimiltude of the world.   One thing I would note is that the game is designed to be challenging by nature and is sometimes very slow and frustating, so if you lack patience and prefer only action, it might not be the game for you. For those of us who grew up playing Final Fantasy or other turn-based games, it is a very refreshing reminder of how fun these games can be if done right, especially with the unique twists this title adds. I would fully recommend the game, to the stage I am even using it for a college project where my task is to create an informative video, similar to ones seen by Mark Brown."
Frankie the Frog,133,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,122.6,"This game is easily better than the first. The graphics are impeccable and the voice acting and story continue to amaze me.

Hands down one of the best games out there. Very good and in depth story. Excellent voice acting and narration. Combat feels fair, and very satisfying. VERY good value for money, this game is very long , so long that I'm still no where near completing it. Dungeon Master mode adds pretty much infinite replayability, though I will say even the regular campaign will do that. Beautiful graphics and amazing soundtrack. Game runs very well, absolutely no performance issues.   Overall, if you like turn based RPG's, or even just RPG's in general, you need to play this. Trust me.  Just be warned that many hours of your life will be absorbed by it.  Score: 9.5/10"

After winning, I'm emotionally exhausted - over the last few weeks and 100 hours playtime, I have developed an unhealthy emotional attachment to my companions.  I dreaded this day; the day I beat the game and would not see my companions again.  Au revoir to the arrogant but stalwart Red Prince, inquisitive Fane, and oh-so fragile Lohse.  In spite of the game's immense replayability thanks to the super catchy character customization and combat options, I will not be loading this up again because I just don't want to go through this emotional roller coaster again.  10/10 would recommend."
Sam,372,1,0,"December 5, 2017",Recommended,71.3,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is by far the best RPG game that I've played this year.  The story is fantastic and changes based on the choices you make, the combat is interesting, and the game is fairly challenging. While in character creation, you are prompted to pick a pre-made origin character or to create your own. I highly recommend using an origin character as all of their dialog is voiced and they have their own unique twist to the overall story. As for the combat, there are almost always ways to interact with your surroundings during a fight whether it be terrain to climb, barrels of oil to burn, or even puddles of water that can be frozen. The combat also gets much harder as you increase the difficulty and really forces you to use your surroundings to your advantage. The only downside to this is that if you're running a cheesy build ranger and rogue each with the lone wolf trait, you can make quick work of almost any enemy from the early-mid-game and on. My biggest gripe about Divinity Original Sin 2 is that things are added automatically to your hot bar as you pick them up or learn a skill. I personally spent 71 hours on my first play through and did quite a few of the side-quests. If you actually read the items that you pick up and do more of the side quests, you could easily get 100+ hours out of one play through. I highly recommend this game to anyone who's into RPG games, especially those with turn-based combat."

Gotrek,137,1,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,169.0,"At the cusp of completion.   I think this game has some major drawbacks. One being the difficulty spikes. I am referring always to classic mode for I have not tried any higher. You are doing well, almost a little too easy but nothing rediculous, and then BAM. You are fighting a group that kicks your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•so hard your teeth hurt. You reload and adapt and thats fun. But sometimes there is a fight that is just plain unfair.(Not much of a spoiler) There is a boss called Eternal Aetera. This is without a doubt the most rediculously hardest fight in the game so far and I bet the harder than the final. She basicly swamps your team by suprise with a sudden group of phantom wolves. She starts the fight and summons 2 more right on top of you and they attack first. In two or three hits they kill someone or leave them critical. Then she will do several attacks in one turn one of them being a group killer: Hail strike. She has a huge amount of armor and magic armor, and she can keep summoning wolves once killed. I have tried every damn strategy there is. I tried rushing, kiting, charming, status effects. I even tried breaking the dialogue to cheese behind the fight with the pyramids. I must be missing something. I had to lower the difficulty just to beat her. A few fights are this way so I think thats a draw back. I love difficulty and challange but unfairness I cant handle.  Another draw back is the source points. I dont think the magic spells should use up these source points. I think the source skills should because regaining your source is kind of rare. You spend a lot of cash getting these awesome spells you level  and put points in for but you need the damn source to use it.   Another thing I dont like is the limited of AP points. It just feels like it limits the strategy and you do the same battle over and over. Turn 1 you teleport or travel to them. Turn 2 you use your strongest attacks. But with that said it still is very very good and fun. You still get a good dose of strategy too.  One thing I really hate about this game is the cryptic quests. Nothing holds your hand and thats a good thing. But the problem isnt doing the quest, its the completion. The problem I am finding is that so many quests seem to intermingle with eachother that actually turning them in is a god damn mystery. First playthrough on the first chapter: I have done about all the quests I could, but, I didnt know how the hell to turn them in so they left me unrewarded when completing the chapter. I dont know maybe I was just too impatient or not reading carefully. But there are so many cryptic steps to these quests that its overwhelming and annoying.  It's too precise, you must kind of be linear, but there are many ways to go about it. Thats the fun part. But trying to actually turn them in and deciphering which quest is actually what for each pertaining method is a huge pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•  Oh and there's bugs (current state)  I love the game and highly recomend it. I dont think it's better than the first one. Theres a ton of dialogue with a good portion of it worthless. It's pretty slow. But the game is very long and it's got good graphics, good music, good story, good level up system and good combat system. UI could be better. Cluttery inventory is unavoidable in this game.  If you like the first game you will like this one. The modding community looks really good. But I think the first game is better. Well worth the price."

The battle system relies less on chance (which I like). There are more ""back-stories"" that influence the playing style and story (I think this is much more replayable than the first game. Ocasionally for some side quest is not clear how/if they can progress and they are still not closed.

„Åµ„Çè„Åµ„Çè„ÅÆÊ≠ª,90,1,0,"October 9, 2016",Recommended,431.5,"This game has filled the void in my body that great games like Geneforge have left in their wake. What makes this game so good? (+ is a Positive, - is a Negative)  +The combat is fun.  +The animations are fluid and easy on the eyes. +I can stab my allies and friends and nobody cares. +I can kill my allies and friends and nobody cares. +I can pillage the corpses of my allies and friends and NOBODY CARES. Except my friends. If you didn't want to die, you should have given me the ring! IT GAVE 2 WIT POINTS! YOU DIDN'T NEED IT! +You can customize your character to a decent degree for an alpha that only sports around 30% of the game's content. +You can turn your tank into the game's scariest kamikaze by lining up oil barrels, wearing a cursed ring and soul shackling yourself to the boss for some hilarious burst damage that leaves crippled enemies floundering around in necrofire. -There isn't enough game to keep me satisfied yet. It has about 2-3 hours of content on Explorer. Ignore this mode ENTIRELY. It makes the game too easy and you end up oneshotting most units. Classic is the right difficulty for beginners in my humble opinion. Even with a party of just 2-3 characters, Classic is entirely doable.  (Advice)  Quickly stat Thievery and aquire Cloak and Dagger for your Thief/Assassin. A good thief can steal tomes from vendors that would otherwise cost over 250 gold for free. Cloak and Dagger is simply the most game-changing move Thieves/Assassins can get. This move is beyond invaluable for a mere 1 AP cost. Self Teleport on a short cooldown that clears away nearby ground effects on use, potentially saving allies nearby you when you teleport away, AND allows you to get to unreachable areas, teleport to those pesky backliners and quickly put you in the position to stun and wreak havoc on the enemy backline. Combined with Teleportation, this gives your Thief/Assassin a crazy amount of control over the battlefield.  Mages should aquire Fossil Strike and some form of AoE fire spell as soon as they can. Having a built in oil barrel makes blocking areas off and burning difficult enemies down quickly so much easier. It also gives you an immense amount of control over the battlefiel with a targetable slow field.  First Aid. This cannot be stressed enough how amazing this Huntsman heal is. It removes every debuff in the game but Cursed and Frozen AND heals a set 30% of hp, making it scale without any of your stat points being tosssed into water magic. It also applies rested.  Necromancers. You want one. Especially if they choose Geomancy as a secondary magical build. The amount of debuffs, self healing and battlefield control they bring is crazy. Blood Rain into Contamination makes the entire battlefield into a poison bog. Add some fire and watch the NPCs panic. Pick Zombie and you will be insanely hard to kill outside of a burst.  (Feedback) I would love to be able to change the instruments in-game AND for each member of the party AND enemies. Being able to do this would be awesome. Enemies could be a more somber or erratic instrument, while my controlled characters would be more vibrant to let me know when it was my turn more clearly. Just a thought~"

Newberg,257,1,0,"October 25, 2017",Recommended,162.1,"Fantastic strategy RPG that doubles as a platform for online D&D.  Pros: -80 to 100 hour campaign -Massive replay value -Fun and creative turn-based strategy combat -Completely free-form leveling system -After the beginning area you can respec all your characters for free forever -Every line of dialogue is voice-acted, complete with an amazing narrator -Comes bundled with a complete creation kit you can use to make mods, maps, and campaigns -Easy to use co-op, plus a GM mode. -You can kill anyone you want. -No forced morality system. -Quests are very creative and usually have different and interesting outcomes.  Cons: -Tactician mode (hard difficulty) requires you to cheese most fights -Usable items you pick up will automatically be placed on your hotbar, cluttering it unless you manually disable that option -Some quests can be bugged if you accidentally do things before the game expected you to. It's never game breaking, but it can be annoying having unfinished quests cluttering your log. -Ambient voice acting gets very annoying, especially if you are at a vendor sorting out your items to sell and you have to hear the same line from nearby NPC's over and over. -Sometimes it's hard to select specific targets if there's a lot of things near eachother, and the slightest movement of your mouse can accidently change your target just as you cast your ability.   All in all, one of the best RPG's to come out in a long time and I highly recommend it."

B√ºrgermeister,140,1,0,"October 11, 2017",Recommended,129.1,"At first I was hesitant at getting this. It looks great, and like a lot of fun, but maybe not worth the price. I thought maybe I'd pick up the game on a sale or something.  But I'm very glad I got it.  The story is very rich and there's so many ways to play. I'm excited for my second and third play throughs.   You can steal from anybody, kill anyone, befriend NPCs, talk to your followers if you choose to have them, and each story is different from character creation. Each race is treated differently, you have different dialogue options if you're an Outlaw, or Scholar, or even if you play a smart Wizard, you can persuade people with your smarts, or intimidate people with your strength.   The combat is very fun, and comboing spells and attacks is awesome.  Classes aren't really set in stone either. If you're a Fighter but decide you want to shock people, or grow some wings, you can very much do so.   And the GM mode is amazing.   As a Game Master for D&D games, I've always wanted a game to play it in, to immerse the players, and let them explore with out having to explain every small detail. And this game does it very well. You can create custom items, NPCs (even down to what hat they wear), allies, and customize the pre set maps the game gives you. I would honestly buy a DLC that includes more maps. But there are plently right now, I'm just afraid that through multiple play throughs we'll all think ""Oh, this map again.""  This game is a masterpiece, but it's not perfect.  The combat is very hard, even on the easiest difficulty it sometimes feels like I need to kill a couple NPCs who don't deserve it so I can level up and continue the story. And sometimes this makes the game feel linear. I don't know if I'm missing something, or I chose bad classes for my party, but either way that's a big down side for me.  That being said, at the time of posting this review I'm 71 hours in, and I havent even completed my first play through, which is a good thing. I'm taking my time, exploring the world, talking to every NPC and living the world.  UPDATE (very minor spoilers):  I finished the game, and I have to say while the ending was good, it was very buggy. I was unable to use res scrolls, enemies would teleport everywhere, and some other minor things.  Arx also felt very bland for what it could have been. Driftwood and all of Reaper's Coast felt huge, and there was so much story there, but Arx... You were there for one thing, and that was to beat the game. I tried to find more to do there, I tried to find side quests, just anything, but there was nothing. Maybe I missed stuff, maybe I didn't. Either way I feel the game no longer deserves my original score of 8.5/10.  8/10"

Gamrage,86,1,0,May 8,Recommended,384.2,"I'm surprised that I haven't written a review of this game since I first started playing it. This game from my own perspective offers quite a bit.   Story: Every single quest has multiple ways of being approached and there is no system of good or evil. You could be doing good thing for terrible people or bad things for noble causes. You could just be pure evil for the sake of being a jerk, and you could make every kindhearted decision out there. There is no wrong choice and anytime you block a certain path due to a choice you made, there is always another option to be explored.  For the amount of choices that this game gives you in terms of social and story progression, it's worth a full price buy in that alone.  Gameplay: Honestly, there is no such thing as a game without bugs. For all the bugs that this game has, it has a devoted team of developers to constantly patch and repair whatever the community reports to them. For every feature the community asks of the devs, they take everything into careful consideration. The combat mechanics are simple and complex at the same time. Every attack has it's own property, physical or magic. Physical damage has no sub categories while magic damage splits into, fire, water, earth, poison and wind. What makes the magical damage so complex is how the elements interact with each other and the environment to make the gameplay more immersive.   Unfortunately, if you want to play the game for pure optimization and not immersion, most people go into pure physical damage builds to ignore the majority of elemental immunities that certain enemies might have in the game.  To sum it up, the game is great and worth more than it sells for."

Leveling up is so satisfying, it's never been so much fun as in this game. I love the turn based aspect of it, lots of depth to it, the combat is all great, magic, ranged, melee, everything is unique and so much fun to watch. I've put some time into this game, and just writing this makes me want to do a 4th playthrough. Buy this game."

If you don't enjoy playing indepth hardcore rpgs without a lot of cutscences but instead a lot more gameplay and and fun challenges and puzzles. It has very beautful moments and the details are really awesome. I plan to play more and with friends so that is amazing that you can do that and have fun with out needing DLC, But if there is a DLC i will get it because this game is worth supporting. This kind of game is what gamers deserve and really earns its high praise. This is the oppsite Destiny 2."

It took me a while to get into the game, and the pacing regarding levelling is a little off at times (if you wander into an area where an enemy is one level higher than you it can be ridiculously tough) but after battling with it for a while it got its teeth into me. 100% Recommend buying this, its one of those games you look at the clock and wonder how 6 hours have passed."

Oh well..... it lets you do that, I cannot wait to do all the stuff I messed up and use classes and skills and find out back stories of characters I couldn't use the first time.  The last game was great, but they removed the ability to destroy the game easily and made it much more difficult, especially in the beginning, and it requires character specialization.

Brave the world in any way you want, be it killing everyone and everything you see moving, sneaking and pickpocketing around or tricking NPCS with your persuasion skills. Combat is very dynamic, with a single spell able to completely transform the battlefield. For example, if I use Rain and then cast a fireball on a water puddle between my party and my enemies, the steam cloud will obscure their vision, forcing hand-to-hand combat. The story is well developed and Origin characters integrate seamlessly with the world and its characters. D:OS2 has my Seal of Approval!"

So I keep playing without refund.  It's when I get to the first map 'Fort Joy' that I start to understand why this game so highly praised.  1. 99% Npc in this game is not useless, it not just stand there repreat the same boring dialogue. There is so many event/secret that can happen by talking to them.  2. 'Every Npc have voice acting!' even those damn rats! This is crazy.  3. Story is not linear. So many way to play this game.  4. Graphics is amazing for old computer. I was worry that my old computer wouldn't able to run graphics as beautiful as they show in screenshot, but my game look like their screenshot with Medium setting.    AMD HD Radeon 6770 AMD Phenom II X4 970 8 GB  5. You don't have to worry about other Hero's level that didn't join your party, because eveyone will always have the same level. This is a really good system, it give you a freedom to choose any Heroes you want to join party without have to worry that their level will get too low and you have to stuck with this companions that you get bored of them.  6. After finished Chapter.1 you'll able to 'Modify your Hero's Status' This is really good, because we'll always ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ed up our character because we're still new to this game.

FireFox Bancroft,360,1,0,January 24,Recommended,15.8,"This game does not hold your hand. Remiscent of older AD&D CRPG's. You control a small 4-player party Baldur's Gate-style around a big world map. Each character in your party has unique skills and abilities. Learn them, train them, master them. You can only have four (4) characters in your party so choose wisely.  Expect brutally and sometimes unfair dice-roll turn-based combat. As for questing, again, don't expect any hand-holding, you either figure things out on your own or you look up a walkthrough. Your quest journal is light on hints as well. They DO give hints but they only give you a nudge in the right direction. NPC conversations contain more detailed hints so you have to really pay attention to what they're saying. Oh and important NPC's CAN die and mess up your progress and you will either have to find another way to complete a quest or reload a previous save. Or just live with the death of that NPC and move on. And speaking of saving, this is a game where you either save-scum or you live with the consequences of your choices.  I can recommend this to hardcore CRPG players who are looking for fun and a challenge. I can't recommend it for RPG-lite players who are used to thinbgs like Oblivion or Skyrim.  My overall assesment of this game is: ""Brutally challenging and interesting without being difficult for difficluty's sake like Dark Souls"""

If you're not incredibly impatient and like turn based RPGS, this is a must buy. If you like DND this is a incredibly huge must buy. The game's normal mode is a bit difficult though, so if you are new to turn based RPGS start on the easy ""explorer"" mode, and if you are experienced with Turn based games start on the ""normal"" mode. You will defintely be challenged in normal mode."
SeanTheSugoi,173,1,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,105.7,Probably the most fun I've had in a game in a very long time. Combat is indeed deep and sometimes you'll end up doing more damage to your team than your enemy would.

I started playing on tactician, and yeah, some fights really suck but it makes it all the better when you win them and get sick‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•loot. The armor system is interesting. It took some getting used to but it's a pretty decent system when you think about it. The combat is phenomenal and has only improved since DOS1. Origin characters have great story behind them and everybody has their own motives and goals. Whether you work together or not is decided by how you play. All in all, This game is badass and I'm only 1/4 of the way through. I have noticed bugs here and there but I haven't experienced anything game breaking. When these are patched this game is an easy 11/10.  TL;DR: This game is a gem of an RPG. It doesn't hold your hand and that's one of the main reasons it's damn good.

hornhollow,650,1,0,"October 1, 2017",Recommended,83.7,"I just finished my first playthrough last night. Let's get this out of the way: this game is something special. It improves on almost every gripe I had with the original (mainly just story and pacing) and just knocks it out of the park. This is a new gold standard for what a modern RPG should be.    What's Good The companions are memorable, well-written, and have realistic motivations that make negotiating their place in your party really engaging as you strive for the end-goal of the game. (I mean, it makes sense, you can play them as the main character if you wish!)  Combat rewards creativity, exploration, and experimentation without ever feeling like it's unfair towards the player--some fights are tough as nails, but they're just puzzles that you've been given an entire toolbox to solve. It's incredible just how many viable strategies you can employ to build a party and the myriad tactical decisions you can make in combat with those interactions.  Some of the quests and puzzles are pretty inspired--I'm a DM for tabletop group and I can appreciate how hard it is to make a puzzle that's challenging and feels organic to its context while delivering on fun. So hard to do, and 90% of the quests and puzzles in D:OS2 deliver. The quests often have multiple paths to resolution, which can be incredibly satisfying.    (Minor) Gripes I only encountered a few bugs over the course of my game and none of them were show-stopping. (A few dialogue options that didn't make sense because of my choices; quicksave reload breaking a script in combat and requiring rollback; a few quests not updating / reflecting change after I made major progress in them.) The lion's share of these happened in the last two major areas of the game--which I totally understand given the sheer scope of the game.   Long story short: there hasn't been an RPG this rich in a long time. It's worth every penny of the price tag."
Jio,19,1,0,"October 22, 2017",Recommended,85.0,"My Lord , what a game.... i have to admit i was cautious when i bought it, i wasnt entirely sure i would be pleased. Oh boy, the game is 1. Endless, an aspect that we have forgotten in rpg games aside from witcher series~ 2. Non repetitive , full of flavor . Nothing has to be done in a certain why, at a certain time, its your story and you do it your way 3. Demanding, even in the easiest mode , the game requires effort, which i personally love , i grew tired of games that are too easy ! 4. Re-playable, now i have almost 40 hours by the time i do this review, iam currently at 15% completion, and i already know i will replay the game when iam done with it because there are so many things that i missed when i started ( which is normal for such a huge game) , now that means that the game offers 150++ hours of entartainment!!!! When other games such as Shadow of war are at 80 hours Max( and cost 15$ higher ) , what more could you be asking from a gaming company?  In summary: iF you enjoyed the witcher series as much as i did and , you love rpg games with items, puzzles, explorations, and dialogue--->or and you are a DND fan ,this game ... is a BUY IT!! The only type of group that i wouldnt suggest this , are for people that do not enjoy a slow heart warming building expierience, the ones that prefer a 60 hour come in come out kind of game."

‚ùÄ Nes ‚ùÄ,142,1,0,August 25,Recommended,155.4,"Let me start off by saying that I don't normally write reviews for games unless they are exceptional. This game lies in one of the few exceptions where I have to.  I bought this game when it first released but I didn't have a good computer to actually fully enjoy it. Fast forward to recently when I did buy one and I fully spent the time to play this game. At first, it seemed difficult for me as I never played the first Divinity and tried to learn my way around the game. Not that long after, I got familiar with the story and the lore. From someone who doesn't enjoy care about the plot of most RPG's or MMORPG's, this game somehow brought the story forward for me to be interested in. I personally built an attatchment to my character and my companions as we continued on this adventure through Divinity. It was an amazing experience and that was when I knew what a gem this game was.  Some of the elements that I found compelling about this game was:   The voice acting - The many actors who portrayed the characters in this game did not disappoint. At times, I was just shocked at the amount of emotion and passion placed into each line of dialogue. My personal favorite was the voice actor for Lohse, whom I felt went above and beyond what some would just skim past. Also a big round of applause to those actors who put themselves out there to voice each animal or dungeon rat that was available throughout the game.   The combat - The understanding of many tactical aspects of each combat situation made it harrowing for me, in a fun sort of way. It was fun to experiment different strategies to clear a particular room of enemies or be faced with decisions that could affect whether or not my party makes it out of combat alive. The high-ground/low-ground system made it particularly mindful to pay attention to your surroundings while the natural elemental occurences (such as oil, poison, fire, etc,) keep you on your toes.   The storytelling - As stated in the above paragraph, the story is phenomenal. I found myself always wondering what would happen next and how my actions would affect the world down the line. It was truly one of the times where I found myself relating to my character, as if I were them rather than me controlling them. I truly loved the way the world was set up and how mostly everything had some role to play either in the narrative of the story or just to contribute to the feel of the world.   The world - Speaking of the feel of the world, everything was how it should be to establish a world that felt dynamic and alive. NPC's truly made their experiences feel real with some having problems that seemed normal and how they were portrayed. I sometimes imagined the theoretical lives of these NPC's and treated them as if they were real people with their own past experiences. When a game can make you engrossed into their world, you know it is good.   Music - The music was excellent at many areas and shifts according to the environment that you were placed in. Dungeons or naturally spooky areas had a feeling of dread but the suspensful and harrowing music helped contribute to the feel of this.  The music that played during the ending fight actually had me tearing up as even though it was something that I heard so many times, knowing that this was final area made it truly special and evoked a lot of memories and emotions of the overall adventure   Overall, I had just finished my first campaign and am planning on finishing more as to learn more about the companions that I did not choose at first and to see all the possible routes that I can go through before I eventually clear up the game. The game's amazing and a big thanks for Larian Studios for putting out such a masterpiece. I can't wait for the Definitive Edition to come out but until then, there are many mods and more to keep you continuously entertained. 10/10"

Storyline is top-notch, OST is absolutely exhilirating, voice acting is professional quality... Gameplay & combat will speak for itself in no time after you sink a few hours into it.  I can't really find much negatives; other than a few buggy quest entries & achievements still hanging around. The game never once crashed on me, and that's saying a lot given how much time I had it running. The whole thing is a gigantic success; which I suspect owes this highly to the good community input during the early access.  If you are the type to save/load a lot (hmmm pickpockets...), I'd highly recommend running this on SSD to avoid longer wait times.

The soundtrack is enchanting.  The overall mechanics of the game are seamless.  I would recommend this game to all lovers of the fantasy genre and to those who enjoy turn-based combat games.

MrStealYourMemes69,150,1,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,71.5,"A vast improvement compared to the first (DOS:EE) installment of the modern series.  Pros: - In-depth turn based combat system - Beautiful visuals, both in and out of combat - Deep lore in relation to the world that you explore and the characters that inhabit it - Multiple ways to go about accomplishing a central objective - Origin characters with a rich backstory exist along custom player-made characters - Replayability is present for 2 or 3 playthroughs in total as long as you don't get bored of the main story - Infinite respeccing options allowing you to completely change each of your characters on the fly with no penalty     whatsoever - Magnificent soundtrack and audio work  Cons: - Although an improvement compared to DOS:EE, the game at times is still fairly unintuitive (looking at you, Arx) - Some minor bugs pose an equally minor annoyance (some characters keep infinitely looping dialogue, audio bugs) - Very lackluster ending - Unable to go back to previous areas after having moved on to the next act / area - Unable to free roam and tie off any loose ends after completeing the game    Conclusion:DOS:2 is a very fun game that I find was worth the money that I've invested into it. I bought it the moment it came out of early access and have sunk a total of 64 hours into it. You can definitely sink more time into this (around 75 or 80 hours total maybe) if you go around and finish every side quest and origin character questline. As I've already mentioned it's a shame that we can't go back and freeroam all of the areas once we finish the game. This was an issue in DOS:EE as well and it's sad to see that the same problem persists here. Either way I must give credit to Larian for a near flawless second installment. If you're on the fence about buying this game I would advise you to wait for the winter sale and see if it drops in price, and if it doesn't, then buy it anyway. The price will not change from $45."

PROS:  - Excellent artwork - Amazing soundtrack and voice acting - Lots of details - Well written dialogues - Companions are useful and interesting  CONS:  - Last act looks a bit too rushed - Minor bugs, probably fixed by now - Crafting feels unfinished in some recipes but it is pretty extense  FULL REVIEW:  It has amazing artwork and an outstanding amount of details that you just can't overlook.   The dialogue is another thing that is really well written, it contains easter eggs, fun jokes and serious or sensitive  lines that will hit you, that goes hand in hand with the voice acting and sound track.  The story stays consistent and it is well made, no matter your choices you won't see a decrease in quality  (I had several saves).  As a bad point I can say the last act looks and feels a bit rushed. Also I have encountered several tiny bugs, but they didn't really trouble me while playing.  The crafting part to me looks lacking, I had several things that couldn't find on any wiki, reddit or similar how to use them or they were kind of useless.  I was not really fond of the armor design (some looked too huge, or they had outstanding stats and looked like plain clothes), or the fact that you have dyes but cannot change the armour color in any way, but maybe that's planned (?).   So my final review is really positive over all of the cons I found, I think It's still worth playing 100%. "

The crossbows use a different mechanic to the 1st game. Now they are identical to bows and have no differences. In the 1st game they were stronger but used more AP, why'd they make them the same as bows? Some things in-game are quite immersion breaking.

waXmahcraX,307,1,0,"December 11, 2017",Recommended,73.9,The first game in many years that I am glad I got at full price. If you like Tabletop RPGs or RPG games in general do not pass this one up. So many different ways to do things. There is so much content here it's crazy I am about 60+ hours on my first (of many) plays and I'm not close to being done yet. Also I met a cow that was cheering on the destruction of a human village and walked in on a Cat and Dog fighting over who the master loves more. Good times. RPG of the year in my books.

Centrifikal,10,1,0,March 14,Recommended,46.7,For the sheer amount of content that this game has it is worth buying.  If you are on the fence about turn based rpgs then this game is the one that will make you change your mind.   Pros:  Looks good.  Plays well.   Many hours of content.  Many skills come with classes.  You can make any build you choose.  Rich Story.  Worth the money compared to other games by far. Cons:   The start is very slow and can be hard on the higher difficulties untill you get geared.  Limitied camera options. Felt like it could zoom out further at times.  I give Divinity Original Sin 2 a 9 out of 10.

Shyrahja,146,1,0,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,95.2,"I am unsure where to begin with Divinity 2 at this point. This game has been and still is an amazing journey you can take on alone or with your friends.  I am hardly convinced with most of the games I play but Divinity has me on a collar. I cannot look away or stop playing it. I already am at 50H and haven't even experienced the whole singleplayer campaign.   The fact that you can talk with every single NPC, including animals (if you got the ""Pet Pal"" Talent early on), that you can explore every corner, find new clues and ways to secret caves or find treasure chests. All those aspects are a big yes for me to recommend Divinity2.   But was that all? Hell no. I haven't even covered 20 percent of what this game is capable of yet! I really enjoy freedom. I want to choose what to do, how to do it and, that should I take the wrong path in a conversation, have to deal with the backfire. Each race reacts differently towards NPC's (as do they. A lot of racism going on in this game) while adding more tags to your character such as ""Barbarian""""Scholar""""Outlaw""""Mystic""""Soldier""""Jester"" and ""Noble"" gives you the options to get more information out of them or successfully persuing them after they saw you stealing. (I have to add this since it caused me great pain. Do NOT click on a trader while they are walking by. I accidentally stole a bottle of wine instead of talking to the trader and hell on earth broke out. Never steal wine guys. NEVER.)   Each races armor looks different depending on what armor you give them. The same helmet looks differently for each race which means just getting out all the armor sets probably took ages and I am glad they put so much detail and work in this game. You can see the development teams heart in it. A great game that is meant to be so much more.  It is sometimes hard to keep the playerbase or even raise those numbers shouldn't there be options to replay the game after ""finishing"". Divinity did everything right. I am putting the word ""finish"" like this simply because of the fact that you will be having a hard time completing this game 100% if not impossible. So many options depending on what you chose while creating your character, while talking, whom you talk too and how. So many options to go, so much to explore, so many ways you can complete a single quest will make it hard for you to not get lost in this wonderful world <3  And I haven't even started to talk about the Game Master aspect. So far I have't been able to look at them simply because of the fact that the moment I have freetime I play the campaign.... I might be addicted at this point.  The option to create your own campaign, invite your friends or upload your work on Divnity's Steam Workshop will give you a never ending adventure.  My friendgroup started to use Divinity as DnD platform. Our GM creates the world and through Divinity you don't need to only imagine it, you can actually see and play your personal adventure.  Since the game is turn based you have everything a little RP heart needs to be happy.   In short: If you enjoy exploring, a never ending adventure and have a great time with your friends while playing Divnity's campaign, a downloaded one from the workshop or your own this is the game for you to play.  A long awaited tripple A game that has been worth all the wait. Hands up for an amazing adventure I will be enjoying for a long time!"

The combat is difficult even on normal, but that's the point; the game asks you to prepare for each fight and use everything to your advantage - including the creation and management of a synergistic 4 person party. I've only played for about 16 hours so far and already I can see how vast the game is, how my choices have affected me thus far, and how I even wish I could start over knowing what I know now. I'd say that level of replayability is a huge part of the fun though. I'm having a blast."

Iron Patriot gc,159,1,0,March 31,Recommended,77.3,"I've played a good number of hours of Divinity 2 and while I love it, the game seems to have lost something from the first. New additions are the choice of making your own character or choosing a pre-set one with variations on back story. There are significantly more spells and skills than before and you also have physical and magical armour. Being able to gain an advantage on the battlefield using height is a welcome addition. However, where I feel it is inferior to the first is the humour, there seems less in the sequel and I didn't care much for the playable characters. Despite this minor flaw I absolutely love the game and would recommend it to fans and newcomers alike."

Gotrek,137,1,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,169.0,"At the cusp of completion.   I think this game has some major drawbacks. One being the difficulty spikes. I am referring always to classic mode for I have not tried any higher. You are doing well, almost a little too easy but nothing rediculous, and then BAM. You are fighting a group that kicks your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•so hard your teeth hurt. You reload and adapt and thats fun. But sometimes there is a fight that is just plain unfair.(Not much of a spoiler) There is a boss called Eternal Aetera. This is without a doubt the most rediculously hardest fight in the game so far and I bet the harder than the final. She basicly swamps your team by suprise with a sudden group of phantom wolves. She starts the fight and summons 2 more right on top of you and they attack first. In two or three hits they kill someone or leave them critical. Then she will do several attacks in one turn one of them being a group killer: Hail strike. She has a huge amount of armor and magic armor, and she can keep summoning wolves once killed. I have tried every damn strategy there is. I tried rushing, kiting, charming, status effects. I even tried breaking the dialogue to cheese behind the fight with the pyramids. I must be missing something. I had to lower the difficulty just to beat her. A few fights are this way so I think thats a draw back. I love difficulty and challange but unfairness I cant handle.  Another draw back is the source points. I dont think the magic spells should use up these source points. I think the source skills should because regaining your source is kind of rare. You spend a lot of cash getting these awesome spells you level  and put points in for but you need the damn source to use it.   Another thing I dont like is the limited of AP points. It just feels like it limits the strategy and you do the same battle over and over. Turn 1 you teleport or travel to them. Turn 2 you use your strongest attacks. But with that said it still is very very good and fun. You still get a good dose of strategy too.  One thing I really hate about this game is the cryptic quests. Nothing holds your hand and thats a good thing. But the problem isnt doing the quest, its the completion. The problem I am finding is that so many quests seem to intermingle with eachother that actually turning them in is a god damn mystery. First playthrough on the first chapter: I have done about all the quests I could, but, I didnt know how the hell to turn them in so they left me unrewarded when completing the chapter. I dont know maybe I was just too impatient or not reading carefully. But there are so many cryptic steps to these quests that its overwhelming and annoying.  It's too precise, you must kind of be linear, but there are many ways to go about it. Thats the fun part. But trying to actually turn them in and deciphering which quest is actually what for each pertaining method is a huge pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•  Oh and there's bugs (current state)  I love the game and highly recomend it. I dont think it's better than the first one. Theres a ton of dialogue with a good portion of it worthless. It's pretty slow. But the game is very long and it's got good graphics, good music, good story, good level up system and good combat system. UI could be better. Cluttery inventory is unavoidable in this game.  If you like the first game you will like this one. The modding community looks really good. But I think the first game is better. Well worth the price."

If you want to destroy the whole town you're in, you can.  If you want to teleport past an entire area you can.  Oh you feel like you're cheating the game by being where you are?  Jokes on you, Larian thought of this and put loot over here for you, or an entire fight or quest line.  The concept of ""play the game how you want"" is so strong here it's almost overwhelming.  On top of that, the quality of the game is amazing as well.  Every line is voice acted, the writing is great, puzzles are well thought out, combat is satisfying, abilties are rewarding.

Though far from game-breaking, it does well to bother. But such a great triple A game for the current price? GET IT.

The attention to detail (all animals are voiced but you only talk to them if you spend a point on the required ability), the flexibility that your abilities come with opens up many options for battles and exploration that is mostly limited by your imagination, and the little hand holding when it comes to exploration (you must talk and explore around instead of waiting for ! marks and waypoints) allows for a greater immersion. I got this game not expecting much outside of a regular RPG, but what I got was an old school DnD-esque game with a lot of depth and ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• me if that's not something that we haven't seen in ages.

I have been constantly failing persuasion attempts and killing important NPC's that lock down important side quests.  Oh well..... it lets you do that, I cannot wait to do all the stuff I messed up and use classes and skills and find out back stories of characters I couldn't use the first time.  The last game was great, but they removed the ability to destroy the game easily and made it much more difficult, especially in the beginning, and it requires character specialization.

JOHN BUTTMADDEN,261,1,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,201.0,"Do you like strategic roleplaying games like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Arcanum, Fallout 1 & 2, Dragon Age (the first one), or XCOM 2?  Well, you're going to love this.  This game combines the roleplaying depth of Dungeons & Dragons with a strategic feeling similar to XCom 2. Practically speaking, what this means is that outside of combat, you can do damn well near anything you can think of. In combat, you can do the same. If you want to break into that house, kill that lady, steal that gold, and escape into the night, you can. If you want to be the daring hero, and save shackled stowaways on a sinking ship, you can. This game gives you the freedom to truly explore the ""RP"" factor of Roleplaying games. Very few games these days can hold a candle to the amount of roleplaying this game encourages.   I think a number of groups of Dungeons and Dragons players will likely abandon tradtional and even virtual play, and just move their games over to Divinity: Original Sin 2. It's easy to learn, hard to master - not unlike D&D - and it's also aesthetically gorgeous in both music and graphics. Can't recommend this game enough. Buy it."

Ahriman,237,1,0,July 28,Recommended,57.9,"I found the story as well as the voice acting in certain parts cheesy. I didn't play any previous games, so I might not be fit to judge the story but that's the impression I got. It didn't really bother me though, maybe they were going for the old school clich√© RPG story.   The funnest part of the game is the countless ways you can tackle quests or objectives. I'm not a big fan of turn-based combat but the one in DOS2 really did it for me. It's challenging and the way you and enemies can interact with the environment (for example wet ground) is really awesome and leads to alot of funny moments co-op.   Every side quest felt unique and it didn't feel like I was doing anything pointless.   The RPG elements are implemented amazingly well. I was impressed by how much your civil abilities, attributes, race as well as the backgrounds you chose at the start (Scholar, Jester, Noble..) of the game affect your dialogue options and ways you can do quests. The game doesn't tie you down when it comes to character builds and there are lots of interesting skills you can combine and play around with. The one thing I didn't like so much was the lack of armor variation for races other than humans, they all look kind of the same to me.  I played through the whole game in co-op which made the experience much more enjoyable. If you can find a friend who's willing to play with you from beginning to end it's tons of fun. I also have a save where I started a playthrough with an NPC companion (Fane). I was pleasantly surprised by how much depth NPC companions have. They have their very own storyline that which you completely miss out on if you don't make them join your party.  I recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a decent RPG, even people who prefer action RPGs."

The Fleshining,114,1,0,July 3,Recommended,69.7,"Have you ever asked yourself what would happen if they could make D&D into an actual videogame? Well look no further! I've been on the fence about buying this game for a while, I finally picked up this game on sale and I'm so far 17 hours into playing this game. All I can say is this may be the greatest RPG I have ever played. Does it have the greatest graphics? No. It is mouse click controls as opposed to WASD. This game more than makes up for all of that with the richness of it's story and lore. In additition the character customization as well as the sheer amount of decisions you can make to complete a quest are vast and astounding. For a game that is not that graphics intense it is still 26 GB and you can see where all that memory goes. You can talk to every single NPC and animal (if you have that skill) in this world and they all have a voice you can actually listen to. You can kill any NPC you want but keep in mind that everything has a consequence in this game. Combat is interesting and again, depending on what skills you have, can be approached in multiple ways depending on the challenge. You can be a ranger with wings, fly up to the high ground and have a tactical advantage. Have a battlemage, shock the most powerful foe, stun lock him while the rest of your party kills all the others. Be a rogue and give every enemy the suprise buttsecks.... everything is a possibility in this game. If you have looked at the game description and been intrigued but maybe not convinced to buy this game, don't even think about it just buy it. You will get your money's worth. This is a game I see myself replaying multiple times in the future."
Delu,705,1,0,August 4,Recommended,70.1,"The game is simply amazing and that is pre upcoming Definitive Edition extensive Update.   One thing I would like to see changed/ revised is that often when you get into cinematic style close up conversations, the NPC you talk to is visually cut off in odd places, usually the head. So you happen to talk to a lot of headless NPC's and a large portion of the screen is filled with Text, so instead of listening and enjoying the view often there is an accidental forced focus on that text and only little visible parts of NPC's at odd angles. If it actually works right on the other hand you see the usually bland facial expression of NPC's but still a large portion of the screen is covered with text. It feels like this could be done better in both cases as it disctracts a lot.  Otherwise an amazing game I highly recommend playing."

[TT] Valentinus570,175,1,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,121.1,"It's a great game !  I got the feeling that I played a good old paper RPG like D&D: no proper ""classes"" (you mix your own), lots of characters, speeches, way to fight, ...  BUT it's definetly not for everyone. It's like you have a sadistic GM: it's tactical, it's hard, it's unforgiving. Prepare for looots of quicksaves, or you'll live with the consequence of your acts Wrong move ? Dead. Wrong answer to a pnj ? Dead. No characters with this ability ? Quest almost impossible to do  Exemple: (very very light spoiler ahead)  I could talk to a Scarecrow: i start the discussion, and then there was NO way, at least for my character as i build it, to avoid the fight with 10 scarecrow 2 level above of me -> F8 to last quicksave	  For those who know/liked the 1st opus: run for it ! Same base, but everything is enhanced, with a lot of quality of live changes, etc ...  I highly recommend for anyone who like hardcore tactical RPG. Btw, the 1st opus is absolutly not needed, for lore-lover, a quick wikipedia summary is enough.  -----------------------------------------  C'est un super jeu !  J'ai vraiment eu l'impression de jouer √† un RPG papier oldschool genre D&D: pas r√©ellement de classes (on construit celle qu'on veut), beaucoup de personnages, de dialogues, d'actions possibles ...  MAIS, c'est pas un jeu accessible/plaisant pour tous. Comme dit plus haut, c'est comme avoir un MJ sadique: c'est tr√®s strat√©gique, tr√®s dur et impardonnable. Pr√©parez-vous √† souvent faire des quicksaves, ou alors vous vivrez avec les cons√©quences irr√©m√©diables de vos actes. Faux mouvement ? Mort. Mauvais r√©ponse ? Mort. Aucun personnage avec telles comp√©tences ? Qu√®te quasi-impossible.  Exemple: (tr√®s tr√®s l√©ger spoiler)  Je pouvais parler avec un √©pouvantail, je lance donc le dialogue, √† partir de l√†, il n'y avait AUCUN moyen, pour mon personnage tel que je l'avais construit, d'√©viter le combat avec 10 √©pouvantails 2 niveaux au dessus de moi -> F8 vers la derni√®re sauvegarde rapide	  Pour ceux qui connaissent/ont aim√© le 1er opus: prenez sans h√©siter ! C'est la m√™me base, mais tout est am√©lior√©, avec beaucoup de modification ""quality of live"" , etc ...  Je recommande vraiment pour tous les fans de RPG ou tactical game un peu hardcore.

Willvasco,183,1,0,July 9,Recommended,74.1,"I am not someone who enjoys isometric RPGs. I love the likes of the later Fallouts, Elder Scrolls, and other first-person action RPGs, but never things like Pillars of Eternity or older isometrics. I am also not a fan of turn based combat, I find it slow and often boring and difficult to pull off well, the only game where this is not the case for me is XCOM. So when my friends kept telling me I needed to play Divinity: Original Sin 2, that it is everything I've ever wanted, I found it hard to believe. It seemed to be the antithesis of what I enjoyed, and on top of that it was more expensive than any game I've purchased in the past three years and I didn't want to take a gamble on it.  That lasted for a couple of months until the summer sale where the game was on sale for $35 and I was looking to spend money so I said what the hell. If I didn't like it, I could always refund it within two hours of game time.  Don't get this game on sale. Get it at the most expensive possible price to give the developers as much money as you can because god damn do they deserve it.  The combat system that I thought I would hate is exactly what I expected, but is nearly perfect along the lines of how XCOM's systems are near perfect. The creativity allowed for in planning encounters around environmental hazards and playing the terrain and elements to you benefit is infinitely entertaining and allows for some truly memorable moments to arrise from seemingly meaningless fights. The isometric view and movement took some getting used to and still is annoying from time to time when it comes to interior environments, but after a couple hours it becomes second nature like any other game.   The absolute, main golden goose of this game is its storytelling. There has not been a game with better storytelling since the Witcher 3 and Divinity even knocks that out of the water. Not in its main overarching story, mind. That in and of itself is wonderous and expansive beyond imagining, nor in its world building that somehow manages to make tolkein-esque fantasy feel fresh and unique without feeling gimicky. But where Divinity really shines is in its moment-to-moment encounters. Almost every single character in the world is given a name and backstory, and all of them are suprisingly deep. Even the animals are given names, stories, personalities and quests, some of which are hilarious and some of which are absolutely heartbreaking, all locked behind one trait you might not even pick.   This is the great beauty of DOS2, the absolutely stunning density of its storytelling and the unbelievable nature of its originality. With something like this it is very easy for quests and stories to become repetitive and boring, but somehow DOS2 manages to keep them all fresh and inventive with characters that you truly, achingly care for even though you've only just met them.   You will get sucked into the world of DOS2, and you'll stay there until you finish it even while you aren't playing. I thought I wouldn't like this game, and even though I am barely halfway done with it it is already one of my favorite games of all time. If you're on the fence, get off that fence and play it. If you aren't interested, rethink your priorities. This game is a modern masterpiece and it will be remembered for years to come."

Zaareish,94,1,0,"December 27, 2017",Recommended,147.1,"A delightfully fresh game (Fresh meat's back on the menu boys!)  This game is one of the best CRPGs you'll ever play, however there are some design issues that are objectively awful.  Random loot, sure it sounds like a stock-standard idea. Randomized loot. but it gets irritating swapping out old stuff with the new every level on all four characters. Trying to remember who needs a new piece of equipment and checking every time is a whole lot of 'belgh.'  Instead of having so much focus on the differnce that levels and equipment makes, why not put it on making unique armors and weapons? There are already exsisting unique items, but they're useless because you're always getting something better. A focus on tactical gameplay rather than numbers, because it's only ever tactical when the enemy is a level above you or there's a load of them kicking thy butt.   That's my biggest gripe.   Spells are fun and the interactivity is novel and satisfying at first, but by act three the player should understand the rather simple mechanics.   Combat, now I liked the combat at first. Then the fights started getting longer, and watching characters cast the same spell and seeing same damn animation everytime really begins to grind on one's nerves. Why not speed up the animations? Or have an option to do that? Why do I have to sit here and watch ten enemies stroll around and take five seconds (the approx time spent casting a single spell) to cast each of their spells.   Crafting blows harder than stormy daniels. I'm not going to carry all that stuff in any of my inventories. Organizing is a chore, so I just get rid of everything except my potions and lotions.   Quests are neat, and the devs know that players will, can, and may do whatever they want to win fights. Break the game. The game is self-aware. It parodies itself and the genre. Sneak mode (haha), and numerous other things I can't remember."

Vinny Vally,205,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,65.5,"Awesome!  So me and 3 of my mates are playing the campaign together - Each of us for the first time so it's all fresh and fun!  Last night we were attacking a group on a balcony which drew aggro from 3 below - There were 2 stairways up to us, one directly and one that went ALL the way around the balcony.  Within a turn or two, two of the guys at the bottom start running up to us. On the close stairway I cast rain and lightning it, stunning the two. After the lightning effect wears off, I oiled a portion of the area and slowed them down. During this time, we finish of most of the enemies up high. The third guy however walked in circles at the bottom seemingly ignoring us...  After a turn or two more, the 2 guys on the stairs reached myself so I teleported one of them back to the bottom to give us some extra time. When I did this, the third guy STILL at the bottom decided to ATTACK his own TEAMMATE to heal himself!! He was on full health!! He just attacked poor Timothy for no reason hahaha!!  Sooooo, a few turns later, the second guy had run back up the stairs and we'd dealt with him and all the others. Just the third guy remaining... He, who obviously wanted no part in this fight, had decided to, for whatever reason, to go up the other stairs and ALLLLLLLL the way around...  So, we decided to set a plan of ambush - Because at this point we were all laughing and just mocking this particular guy anyway - So we all gathered on the balcony that the path led to just around a corner, except for our support guy who stood right at the back of the path.. I set a layer of ice, and some oil, and then we just skipped turns for him to run to us.  Finally, one turn away, JUST around this corner we could see him. I froze the poor guy, and someone else warmed him up just to toy with him. We were all laughing given how long it took for him to get there... HIS TURN!! FINALLY!! We figured we'd let him hit just one of us just because.. But no!! What's this?? He's run past me... And my friend... And another... And then past 2 minions... Where's he going?!?! hahahaha. He ran directly at the support guy but ran out of AP and just stood next to him thinking for a while, then passed his go! Hahahaha!! He'd just about made it around the entire balcony when we finally killed him..  God damn that was funny!! Cannot wait till we're all online tonight :D    Basically the same game as the first but with improvements in skills, choices, graphics, etc. Highly recommended!"

xace,56,1,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,65.8,"One of the best games I have ever played.  Several bugs and lack of features make it fall just short of that #1 however.  My main concerns are in multiplayer. You have to play as the hosts party characters and not your own. That means playing an archer with a level 2 bow, all stats in wits and other useless talents. There is also an endless amount of bugs with multiplayer. For example, if I am host and start a multiplayer and someone joins me as say The Red Prince and I save, restart whatever, that character then becomes bugged. Instead of reverting back to The Red Prince after that player leaves, he bears that persons name and is unable to be reset, or even dismissed. You normally can talk to npc's in your party and say you want to go your seperate ways and recruit another party member, nope. bugged.  Another example is I use one of my npc's for dialect options since they have persuasion stats and my main is undead. Someone joined the game and took control of MY character and when I leveled up he butchered his stats and skills and those remained on my character after I kicked him and / or restarted the game.  These things make multiplayer extremely frustrating and have forced me to start brand new games probably about 6 times now. I haven't even been able to get through act 1. I am very wary to play in multiplayer due to all these reasons and despite preferring multiplayer in it's theory am forced to play single player to avoid game breaking bugs like those i mentioned. I wish I could provide some feedback or get some kind of bug fix on this bug I don't see an option for that. Thankfully the developer is very involved in the game and will probably fix this at some point. I am now hoping that a user created mod will fix many of these issues in the future (thank god this game has mods)  Despite all my frustrations this game is absolutely incredible in every other aspect. Everything is voiced, every npc which is amazing. Graphics are good (not great) especially for this type of game. Quests are actually fun and not all fetch they actually have lore. There is an absolute freedom: you can kill every npc and still proceed with the game. The gameplay is some of the best ever. This genre has been ruined in the past decade with games like the Final Fantasy series dropping the traditional turn-based combat for an active combat. Yeah, thats nice in some circumstances but it is extremely boring hacking and slashing repetitively just like every other game. The combat in D:OS2 is calculated, and detailed. Everything is listed and heavily focused on strategy and statuses. The game encourages using environments such as high ground and environmentals like barrels and puddles in order to gain favor in battle.   The best part of the game is the fact it's challenging. The default difficulty will probably be too hard for average gamers and those not familiar with the genre or the first game. There are two higher difficulties on top of that which are extremely challenging (I normally play on the highest difficulty in every other game) The next best thing would be that the developers aren't EA, Ubisoft, Activision, etc and force paywalls on an incomplete game and don't support the game after launch. This dev actually cares and I have personally downloaded atleast one patch per day and they have already stated that they are going to implement being able to use your own character in multiplayer which is something I look forward to.

UKLonar,209,1,0,"November 9, 2017",Recommended,83.5,"I'd absolutely recommend picking this game up. It's a masterpiece of the modern age, with a classic-styled twist.  Although difficult at times, you can usually figure out a method of beating fights. Despite what some people are saying, the game isn't too hard. There are so many builds/skills you can choose from and many many sidequests to get gear and level up; better preparing you for the difficult fights. You also don't need to go online and look for ""Cookie cutter"" builds. So don't let people put you off!  Although, get used to ""Savescumming"" whilst you learn encounters.  I'm not well versed with CRPG's so I was hesitant to pick this game up initially.  However, I'd now recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs.  I'll be running through my second-playthrough soon, as I know I've missed a fair bit!  Give it a chance, you won't regret it! "

Ray G. Quit,281,1,0,"November 11, 2017",Recommended,210.4,"Pretty good RPG with a classic feeling to it. A lot of content and a lot of replayability. The fact that you can play it with a friend and give him control over characters (4 party members, so we played 2:2) is just awesome and led to many laughs. I would recommend it and I'll just highlight 3 aspects of the game that were memorable about it in the good, the bad and the ugly (okay, the neutral).   The good: I hate any tactician turn-based game. Often they're overcomplicated. But this one? This one was ... definitely complex but somehow I came around to like it. Everything made sense and learning how things works by setting EVERYTHING ON FIRE was a fun experience. Gameplay is just fun, making a builds and testing them out was great, there's a lot of possibilities to go around. Lots of things to find, lots of ways to resolve an issue, lots of surprises. If gameplay is what you're after then you won't be disappointed.  The bad: BUGS. Oh my god the bugs. Not many - true, but one extended turns in a certain boss fight to make it last forever for enemy to finish his turn. Another one made me lose about 15 hours of progress, because I couldn't access ""home-base"" waypoint and had to load older save. And yet another - by a chance we found out a bug that can make you immortal duplicating an Idol that ressurects you for no cost at all so you could gear up your whole team with immortality idols and pass the game in easy mode. What the hell. Larian fix your game, bugs in key moments are not acceptable, especially after the game came out of early access.  The neutral: Story and lore. Honestly only story for your companions was any good and made you care. Overall the game is about ego trip to become divine and often we were in a pretty good spot to not care about anyone else than our own quest to power. Factions and key characters even when they started as good, sooner or later they ended up not so rightous to a point I didn't mind killing most of them. Never felt there was any greater incentive to be ""the good guy"" or choosing ""the lesser evil"" in this game. The whole world felt not worth fighting for. Maybe that is the point? It's not bad, it definitely had some depth to it, but still felt ""meh""."

Hierophant Druid,24,1,0,"December 6, 2017",Recommended,147.4,"Long have I been looking for a big RPG game in the trend of Baldur's Gate/Planescape Torment and to a lesser extend NWN and NWN2. That wait is over.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 gave me that same feeling I got when I first played Baldur's Gate 2 so long ago. It has a giant sprawling world with so many things to do and so many mechanics to make it even more fun, I spend so much time plotting on how to rob merchants off their goods/money. The turn-based combat is very addicting, I am normally not a fan of turn based combat, but D:OS2 does it incredibly well, very much like X-Com.   For those of you who loved Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 and are a bit turned off by the turn based combat, please give this game a chance because it's the closest thing we have gotten to BG.  The story of this game is alright, there are plenty of mysteries and questions unanswered at the start and middle of the game to keep you engaged. But the main focus in this game is its story and game mechanics. The way the quests and maps compliment each other makes it very addicting to completionists. You want to complete every single quest in each area. This combined with amazing visuals and great sound, it is definitely worth all the money.  I finished the game in about 140+ hours on my first playthrough, and every hour was worth it, I cannot recall a single game (next to BG/BG2) that gave me this many hours of fun in a single playthrough.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 gets a solid 9 from me."

Potatus Tomatus Greenbeanius IV,175,1,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,224.2,"A great game. But it seems they ran out of resources at some point mid-development.  Nice story, nice graphics, a lot of quests, none of the quests is repetitive, all the voice actings, and all that. The game itself is fantastic and exceedingly immersive as I've spent around 200 hours to finish just the first playthrough.  However, it is apparent that they rushed on finishing the game from somewhere like 2/3 of the way. The most noticeable evidence, which a lot of people on the discussion forum complain about, is that somewhat rather many quests will not properly be completed. For instance, even if you've done everything and the quest log also says so, the quest remains uncompleted and say something like you abandoned the quest, when you move to the next area. The next problem, from my experience, is that I've noticed some slopinesses here and there throughout the game. For example, some dialogue options are just null, which means the game (or npcs) doesn't recognise the dialogue options and just quit the conversation. For another example, there is a quest in an earlier chapter involving an npc which implies there is more to be found in later chapters about the npc, but nothing ever mentions anything about the npc as if she never even existed, even if the npc has been on the same boat (literally) to the very end of the game. They are not like game breaking bugs, but still, annoying and feel like that their care for polishing the game has been started decreasing at some point.  Overall, I'm not saying like the game is bad or anything like that, it's just that I've noticed these small things (maybe big?) throughout the game and they were annoying. Consider it as a small complain. But still, it's a great game and worth every penny, and that's why I'm giving it a yes to 'Do you recommend this game?'. It's been a great experience and well spent over-200 hours. I highly recommend the game. If they do some patch-works, I think it would be safe to call it a masterpiece. :D"

The characters are rich and it's neat to see all the various ways different party members interact with things differently.

It is dark, though - not a happy time for Rivellon - so if you're a person who actively dislikes blood, violent choices, dark thoughts, etc, and prefers more shiny Fantasy, then this isn't likely for you."

PLayed the D:OS EE when it came aout and found this already supererb but the 2nd part can even top this. The story is awesome, the level of detail and the love the developers packed in almost everything is just mind blowing. You can spent hours just listening to characters, speaking with NPCs and enjoy the environment. Not that you have to, but you can. where you have to follow dialogs for quests they are to the point but entertaining and really drag one into the game.  PLayed the storyline in Coop with a friend (2-2) and also the coop gameplay is double+. turn based combat along with the deep strategy and knowledge of your skills make fights extremly challengeing and rewarding at once. Sometimes a fight can take an hour - but you won't feel it.  BOTTOMLINE: fi you are into RPG, go get it - it is a 100% buy recommendation. and when out, buy the D:OS EE, too even at fullprice still the game is worth it.

Starting from Betrayal at Krondor, Baldur's gate, Neverwinternights, Icewind Dale, Dragon Age-this game trumps it all. I'm still just 90 hrs into the game and this game blows me away.

Cool Barry,149,1,0,August 9,Recommended,205.2,"My all time favourite RPG. Major plus is that it is getting a very large update (""Definitive Edition"") that's free for current owners, which adds graphical and interface updates and over 30 hours of content.  Pros: Up to 4-player fun Different ways to progress and clear encounters Different builds allow you to make unique characters Playable pre-made characters have interesting storylines Really makes you feel like Batman Interesting changes to how you approach the game depending on your chosen race The most Dungeons and Dragons like game I've seen so far Massive editor to make your own campaigns and have your friends play in it  Cons: The hardest difficulty mode is way too easy and I beat it without looking up guides online or preparing for it in some way. Can have framedrops in some areas if there is a lot of stuff on the ground (fire notably). Supposedly being improved in the definitive edition. You can have a hard time if you make mistakes while building your character, but you can fix this for free not too far into the game."

Silverborn,256,1,0,"December 2, 2017",Recommended,396.4,"This game has to be one of my all time favorites. Tactical freedom is close to rediculous. From the team you pick, the weapons you choose, the small moments the world interacts with you, or you realize that an entire area's storyline has changed (ever so slightly, but with some weight) because you chose to be a baddy for 3 minutes, the second time. This game is the perfect example of how games should be.  Divinity Original Sin 2 has depth, amazingly fun gameplay. Can be massively challenging and punishes those who run into danger without thinking. I'm currently on my honor run close to the ending of Act 2. This is the hardest difficulty with permadeath. Meaning... when your party dies, you lose your savegame. And no... this is not Xcom where you can Alt-F4 when‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•hits the fan. The second a character dies, the game saves for you. Good luck getting yourself out of that pickle. With good preperation comes great rewards. Fights can be easy at times, but if I think for one second that I'm overpowered..? The game punishes me hard.  And that is what I love. It's like advanced chess, but you don't play ""the same pieces"", your characters evolve, become stronger. No pure warrior, naaah... give him some heals and necromancy spells to leech the blood out of your enemies. Making him the most dangerous guy on the field at all times. Feel like your character isn't strong enough? Give your archer some support spells to boost each others moves. Now your dangerous guy has the potential to kill four characters in two turns. And who needs a shield when you have a healthpool of 3000 health, hit with 500 dmg per swing and heal 70% of the damage done? One good area attack and you are healthy as an ox. And I know that when my warrior gets nuked with stuns etc? My archer is there with the right support spells to get him out again. And at no time am I really overpowered. Two times I almost lost my savegame because I misjudged a few skills from enemies. The constant struggle to play with the best optimisation and adapt to the game's AI. It's simply amazing.   Don't expect too much from the main story. It has depth, interesting aspects but you buy this game 100% for the gameplay. Do know... you CAN kinda abuse the game at later levels. There are skills that can be abused so you absolutely trash everything with the proper respec. Keep in mind that figuring out how the game works, what spells do etcetera, THAT is where the most fun is.   Some other Pro tips: - Stealing is great fun, saves tons of money and keeps your party geared up (probably the best tip, do not-not steal).  - Undead are awesome, but start with a regular team, different mechanics can mess your party up if unprepared.  - Stick to either full physical damage OR full magical damage. Trust me on this one, you will thank me later.  - Summoners are overrated. They kinda make fights last 3x longer than needed. Only pick them if you absolutely love the mechanics.  - Figure out how to use stealth in combination with teleportation. You can ""cheat"" some fights that will otherwise trash your party.  - You can respec shortly after the end of Act 1, which is - on average - 10 hours of gameplay - Crafting... almost EVERYTHING can be crafted. You only get to see 10% of the recipes that actually excist. Just google a crafting wiki. Thank me later. Don't wait until you find the books. If you want to make something, you probably can.  - Make sure your characters can survive alone as well. If they are too dependent on each other you will have a hard time nearing the endgame.  - Last but not least... Aim to finish about 80% of all the (side)quests. You will need the experience until the middle of Act 2, after that the game becomes a little more flexible when it comes to XP.   Downsides of the game? It can be buggy, but rarely game breaking. AI can be brutal, feel unfair... but there is a pattern to exploit at all times. Quests can still be bugged out because you did something so complex that the game doesn't really know what you actually did."

ShimmerVoid,345,1,0,"October 18, 2017",Recommended,100.3,"DO2 is quite the masterpiece. There's just so much content and most of the choices you make have very real consequences, much like the Witcher series. Characters are interesting, lines are well written, gameplay is really good (comparable to good old Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and similar titles but instead of being semi real time it's actually turn based in DO2), character customization is out of this world (no strict classes restriction; anyone can pick up any skill as long as you have the prerequisite skill levels) and interesting races (undead in particular) make DO2 a memorable experience and easily one of the best games for 2017.  One minor gripe though, in my first playthrough I couldn't quite get the ending to trigger properly as it was bugged. I did make some very odd choices along the way and was playing just a 2 man party so maybe that might have broke a few things but still ... it really bummed me out.

Buckle up, because this has dominated my time for the past several weeks - I've left behind countless ""Big, AAA Games"" in favor of this unrequitted, resplendent experience.  It has been years since I've experienced such an engrossing game that has snagged my attention so tightly, that I'm already contemplating my next playthough before I've even finished (thinking 2-Hander, Death Knight style). That too: you can effectively combine the numerous capabilities possible in the game to create archetypical styles, or something completely unique! I don't care so much for the meta (given that it's and RPG), but that's there too - along with an equally engrossed community that is igniting to life with new mods and stuff coming out weekly (at time of writing this).  In conclusion...  If you LOVE... Stories, Stats, Strategy, Detailed Environments, Customization, Choice, Magic, and Adventure...  Buy this game now.  Otherwise, just don't."

Grim,242,1,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,70.0,Have been looking for a good RPG to scratch that itch. I've been looking for awhile and decided to pick this up and was automatically hooked. I spend 15 hours alone inside Fort joy (starting area) making sure i liked my character and the party following. This game is a must get for RPG lovers.
XPGLD,240,1,0,October 16,Recommended,125.6,"Larian yet again hits it out of the park. Another game with so much attention to detail it's almost criminal. Though Divinity is a fantastic game, it is not without its faults either. If you haven't play the original, which does not bar entry to enjoy Divinity 2, you may find the tutorial area lacking in, well tutorials. While some may find this to be a feature, I found that it made the first few hours of gameplay a slog of trial and error before I figured out how to be even slightly effective in combat.  All around however, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a fantastic game that you can enjoy solo, or with up to 3 friends. If turn based tactical combat is your cup of tea, there aren't many games out there that do it better than Divinity."
Sasuga,652,1,0,October 16,Recommended,32.9,"I love games like this, and this one is very well done. Best one I've seen. I love the way hiding works, the rules in general, the game runs cleanly and smoothly for me. Graphics and artwork are great. Haven't played with the GM-Mode yet, but fully intend."
Beardless Man,38,1,0,October 16,Recommended,373.2,"One of my most highly recommended RPG games to date. This game has really been a prime example of a true Roleplaying game ought to be. From gameplay, to storytelling, character customization, and character builds that is entirely up to you.  I'll break down the game by its Pros and Cons, and add some of my feedback or advise at the end to help change the game.   PRO'S: - Character Creation is very open and fluid, but not restrictive. Playing as Humans, Elves, Dwarves, or Lizards as well as undead counterparts;  These races all have their unique traits and uniquely recognized in the game. NPCs react differently on the race you play.  The customization options certainly could always use more; but you can always find a good look for you.  - Combat is all about problem solving. All dependant on the builds you create to help expertly pass speicifc fights. If you don't specialize in Persuasion to avoid some fights all together.  Whether your team is all ranged, melee, magic, or mixture of all three. Your job is to figure the best tactful moves to assure victory. Wether you have multiple healing aiblities spread across the team, or one dedicated healer.   - World environment is gorgeous. Even wtih a top-down view. You can always look through the area and see such attention to detail . Not a single place in this game feels like a drag-drop copy. And it all flows perfectly.   - Voice acting is top notch, whether you play an Origin Character or Custom Character. The Origin followers have brilliant commentary that give their personality great depths. NPCs all are uniquely voiced with very few reprisal roles that still achieve a personality.  Even better how all the NPCs have hundreds of dialog branches based on your race, gender, and background tags that you select or have as your origin character.  - The game rewards thinking out the box. Whether you skip a puzzle through mobility moves, or attack specific NPCs. IF you get a grasp of specific play, the game will recognize clever  behavior and will speak of it in later gameplay.  (**Minor Spoiler**: Dallis the Hammer, a primary antaognist can be attacked as soon as the beginning of the game. If you manage to defeat her, she escapes and leaves a very powerful hammer, and comment on it when you engage her once more.) ----------------------- Cons:   - Character Creation can be a bit limiting for specific races that lack additional features such as beards. If an update patch or DLC added more options. It would make the uniqueness of your character stand out.  - Some weapons like wands become weaker in the late game and could use a numerical change to come up to par. Often one will drop wands for a staff due to the lack of numerical value.  - Some design choices for mandatory abilities such as Bless require a memory slot despite the high volume of times in the game its required to be used. Some changes for it to always be memorized would be beneficial to match.   ----------------------- Advise / Feedback: I would change the ability: Bless to not require Source. The ability has great demand in the storyline; but mechanic wise; its primarily the weakest option only because Source Abilities are rarely used until middle/late game. Bless becomes increasingly worthless the further one progresses.   It also acts as one of the only few counters against the Cursed Status, which is a huge problem in the later game when one faces the Voidwoken.   The Pet Pal: Talent should be changed for those who have the Sir Lora DLC To whomever he follows; he should grant the Pet Pal talent to. If one lacks the talent; this little squirrel sadly becomes more of an annoyance than a fun little mobile dialog through the story.   More Origin choices for custom characters - Currently the only origin ability that custom character gets is a protective dome. If we should choose from a selection of Origin abilities, it would give us further importance on decisions. Though I could see why it'd encourage more people to play differently.   "
Teddy,78,1,0,October 17,Recommended,104.4,"fantastic game, one of the best in the genre."
HammerTime,86,1,0,October 17,Recommended,52.7,this game is absolutely incredible
Squidcake,449,1,0,"November 25, 2017",Recommended,83.0,"it's a great game, but near the end things start to fall apart abit. The last area(s) of the game are unnecessarily large (Arx) and just kill the game's performance. Combat also mostly becomes fairly tedious with enemies just spamming crowd control, sometimes resulting in watching your turns skip 5 times in a row, just to have the enemy repeat the process. Other battles involve finnicky mechanics like infinite respawn unless killed in a certain way, that don't behave the way they should.  Overal, still a great game, but I really wish the end of the game was planned out better."
Slimey,110,1,0,October 15,Recommended,198.7,"I'm going to keep this pretty much short and to the point. On the whole I really enjoyed this game, but there were a few niggles that stick out. Nothing show stopping, but there nonetheless. I liked the story and I loved the characterisation. I feel it developed well as the gaem went on, though I feel the 3rd act was a little off kilter from the rest and teh 4th was a little rushed as the end came near. I'd argue this could have held upa 5th act fairly easily and left the story pretty well rounded out. As per the orignal game the graphics are excellent and with the characterisation I actually felt this the better of the 2 games.  But a few things stood out as cons and depending on your game style/preference this may affect how you approach the game. - Some quests are difficult to work out. The fact some can pop into your journal with almost no exposition beforehand and/or they have obscure solutions that can be almost a fluke to complete breaks the story for me. It's mainly side quests, but when you are trying to max experience to level up your characters its annoying to chase half way across the map because you missed something. And the fact some characters can remain 'red flagged' even after completing a quest is plain annoying. - Necro fire is overdone. With all the possibilities of surface/cloud mechanics, this gets tired quickly. Especially in act 2. - It's not clear from some spell descriptions exactly what they do. It's pretty annoying to fire off a spell and find it didn't work because you missed a line of text or the like. (Along these lines, it also annoys me that after spending effort on writing up descriptions for things they are often unreadable because the descriptive box doesn't draw correctly) - Determining the correct responses/best persuassion chances is sometimes almost random, and the fact in some conversations your ratings almost do not matter. It would be more realistic to be able to explore a characters wants and needs and then come up wiht the right answer to a question, than to plain guess in many instances. This breaks the narrative for me and the fact the wrong conversation option in some places can all but break a quest is jarring. - Depending on how you levelled up, selected spells etc. the end can be almost an anticlimax. Wrong choice can get you wiped out in a couple fo rounds, 'right' choice can win it for you very quickly. Tactics are almost taken out of the last battle entirely.  But it still a great game. I still haven't completed PoE, let alone picked up the sequel. DOS2 at least has an easy to follow plot and characterisation to carry you along. If you can put up wiht its foibles, its one of the best in the genre."

[TINC] Lico,284,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,84.1,"Divinity 2 brings all the good elements of its predecessor, with incredibly smooth level/power scaling and low potential for exploits. Brave the world in any way you want, be it killing everyone and everything you see moving, sneaking and pickpocketing around or tricking NPCS with your persuasion skills. Combat is very dynamic, with a single spell able to completely transform the battlefield. For example, if I use Rain and then cast a fireball on a water puddle between my party and my enemies, the steam cloud will obscure their vision, forcing hand-to-hand combat. The story is well developed and Origin characters integrate seamlessly with the world and its characters. D:OS2 has my Seal of Approval!"

FireFox Bancroft,360,1,0,January 24,Recommended,15.8,"This game does not hold your hand. Remiscent of older AD&D CRPG's. You control a small 4-player party Baldur's Gate-style around a big world map. Each character in your party has unique skills and abilities. Learn them, train them, master them. You can only have four (4) characters in your party so choose wisely.  Expect brutally and sometimes unfair dice-roll turn-based combat. As for questing, again, don't expect any hand-holding, you either figure things out on your own or you look up a walkthrough. Your quest journal is light on hints as well. They DO give hints but they only give you a nudge in the right direction. NPC conversations contain more detailed hints so you have to really pay attention to what they're saying. Oh and important NPC's CAN die and mess up your progress and you will either have to find another way to complete a quest or reload a previous save. Or just live with the death of that NPC and move on. And speaking of saving, this is a game where you either save-scum or you live with the consequences of your choices.  I can recommend this to hardcore CRPG players who are looking for fun and a challenge. I can't recommend it for RPG-lite players who are used to thinbgs like Oblivion or Skyrim.  My overall assesment of this game is: ""Brutally challenging and interesting without being difficult for difficluty's sake like Dark Souls"""

LouskRad,"3,694",1,0,"November 24, 2017",Recommended,165.8,"Simply amazing.   In terms of strorytelling, this rpg provides an immersive experience with a story you won't guess from the first gameplay hour. It's epic and it's character dependent (to a point). The optional pre-made characters enrich this story, even if the player does not play one (they can also be rectuited as party members).  In terms of rpg gameplay dynamics, the potential this game offers for character skill variation can result in absurdly overpowering characters, yet the level progression system somehow compansates; resulting in a feeling of powermonger.  On top of these, all dialogues are voice acted, graphics are beautifully stylized (ne can especially find the richly colorful style goes quite interesting with story) and the game camera works wonders.  As a result, I was quite happy that I backed this game and it was honestly better than I expected."

The Fleshining,114,1,0,July 3,Recommended,69.7,"Have you ever asked yourself what would happen if they could make D&D into an actual videogame? Well look no further! I've been on the fence about buying this game for a while, I finally picked up this game on sale and I'm so far 17 hours into playing this game. All I can say is this may be the greatest RPG I have ever played. Does it have the greatest graphics? No. It is mouse click controls as opposed to WASD. This game more than makes up for all of that with the richness of it's story and lore. In additition the character customization as well as the sheer amount of decisions you can make to complete a quest are vast and astounding. For a game that is not that graphics intense it is still 26 GB and you can see where all that memory goes. You can talk to every single NPC and animal (if you have that skill) in this world and they all have a voice you can actually listen to. You can kill any NPC you want but keep in mind that everything has a consequence in this game. Combat is interesting and again, depending on what skills you have, can be approached in multiple ways depending on the challenge. You can be a ranger with wings, fly up to the high ground and have a tactical advantage. Have a battlemage, shock the most powerful foe, stun lock him while the rest of your party kills all the others. Be a rogue and give every enemy the suprise buttsecks.... everything is a possibility in this game. If you have looked at the game description and been intrigued but maybe not convinced to buy this game, don't even think about it just buy it. You will get your money's worth. This is a game I see myself replaying multiple times in the future."

Atak,28,1,0,September 9,Recommended,103.4,"For someone like me who got mesmerized by the first game, this game can only get better; not the other way around.  Combat mechanics are absolutely brilliant and it adds to your roleplaying too. Fantasizing about your wizard cast a rain spell and your ranger pulling out a electric arrow from his backpack and stunning the enemy is delightful. With definitive edition, online pvp matches got an overhaul and it definitely got better. Only problem is there is not much people playing online so when you search for matches you find 2 rooms which are both full for example.  Having the choice of playing with diffrent characters is a wonderful edition to the first game. Commanding your team and living the story through each  4 individuals perspective in one go might be a bad thing for some of us but the choice is yours. You can choose to go through 2 - 3 diffrent playthroughs and each one would be a bit diffrent than each other.  Or maybe you want to play co-op online,local or on LAN with your friends and go to your seperate ways in the same game! Larian did an amazing job by keeping the loading screens to minimum-none; meaning you can teleport around the map, find your friend in a faraway pub in a seemless transition which why this game doesn't let you go and captivates you.  My displeasure with this game is its art style for character models and portraits. Of course everybody have their own tastes but for a beautiful game like this, characters seem a bit off putting for me. Also the first part of the game can get repetetive after multiple playthroughs which can stop you from starting over again after a few times. Maybe diffrent beginnings for each character or a more sandboxy start would be better in my opinion.  Songs and voices are great. Humour is there for the ones looking for, so the game is not edgy or too dramatic. Larian really busts their asses to give you quality content and making the definitive edition free for the owners of the original game only deserves appreciation. Definitely worth playing. Best RPG on the market for now."

It get's *really really* more interesting in fun-wise, quest-wise, and lore-wise aspect the farther you are from the beginning and it doesn't seem to stop omghosh! Game offers zillions of approches with few standing out at the apparent ones. Game doesn't force you to attend to every choice or thing, you can really go your own build or be a jack-of-all trade. Ofc you can screw up hard, but than again, why you invested points willy-nilly in the first place? Good interface. Good outlook. Little to no glitches or bugs I found after 50 hours of real ingame (don't watch my 300 hours I sometimes forget the game in the background.)  Difficulty: ?/10 I play RPG my whole life. On hard settings I have really hard and frustrating combat sometimes. Paradoxically not with bosses but with semi-bosses and larger battles. Like reloading 5-6 times before I come to a solution, some battles just cannot be won by sheer force and positioning. But hey, they said it would be hard, right :D ? I believe on normal this is more normal, right? :D  Graphics: 8/10 As the isometric RPGs goe, this world and it's architecture is just wonderful. BUT there is one little bad thing that is big in impact though. Small items are often nigh impossible to see with your own eyes. Like keys, coins, gems, plants... :( it really forces you to hit alt to see all items in vincinity and spoiling the fun of being observant. The very first Divinity was impossibly great with it's keys hidden under the door mat, hidden switches behind barrels you had to move etc. Those were the days... but you could have seen those items, here, you really can't unless you have a 10x zoom in your cybernetic eyes, Larian, wtf, we are not all Krytons you know :(  Sound: 8/10 Everything is fine. Music is fine, sometimes even cool, though for me, there are no realy memorable songs or compositions. Voicing is really nice and suits the characters well on the other hand. Sound is good as sounds can go.   Fun:: 10/10 - Absolutely one in a million chance to play this as coop multiplayer. WTF MAN, shut up and take my money and my friend's credit card... - Teleportation spell. Oh my goodness. You'll know all the uses soon enough. - Healing undeads with poison? ok lol, wait it get's even stranger... - Chicken spell + Haste + Rupture tendons on enemies. HAHAHAHA - Hero remarks, having a Talk to animals skill makes you able to apprehend animals with their silly little quests, being often reminded of the points of morality more then from a fellow human :D, funny locations, easter eggs, Fane's view of the world, and his strange experiences being a lesser being :D.. - So much to explore, and being rewarded for being dilligent or observant of the lore and people's relations (but not much of the surrounding, as you now know). Or not, just go your own hacky-slashy way, you will have fun too. - Probably some replayability with the different characters, the game is huge as are the numbers of approaches you can take, but still, you might not want to play this beast after 200+ hours in it again."

That being said, I've probably played through this game like 6 times so far and not only is it still so fun, I'm pretty certain there are still things I have yet to see! The game is amazing as is, but the mods really let you take it to the next level.  Already, there are mods for crafting, combat balancing, new spells/items, and a host of other really cool/enriching elements that can be added.  I love to browse the workshop to see how I can spice up my next play through.  I'm more of a single-player person and so I haven't tried playing this game online, but I imagine if you enjoyed multiplayer then there will be 100s of more hours of quality gaming to be found with D:OS 2.  If you like turn-based tactical combat, insane puzzles, and the freedom to do and/or explore anything... orrr if you fancy yourself a cat.. stop reading reviews and throw money at your screen!  This is a game you don't want to miss!"
yvesp,67,1,0,"December 26, 2017",Recommended,375.6,"Larian turned gold to lead, but this game is probably worth it, provided that you know what you do.  First off, choose wisely your play level. I chose tactician as a veteran of RPG. I was well served. Indeed, tactician it is! But it doesn't say that you should also scratch every single little advantage that you can (steal as much as possible, stack on potions etc.) in order to be well prepared for the last fight. It also doesn't say that you shouldn't expect your characters to be heroic! Indeed, in many situations at that level you will have to resort to cheesy tactics such as some characters fleeing the combat to recover skill timers, heal, then come back while the combat has been frozen because you left one character or invocation hold it... Or by reloading consistently because you were not prepared for a nasty surprise in a combat and had nothing left to deal with it; so you reload, come back with smart prepositionning and the combat will go smoothly. I remember a fight against some outrageous horror -helped by numerous cronies, all of them more powerful than my characters despite being one level above-, which I easily lost head to head, then won after reloading, placing my characters far enough, engaging with invocations and keeping my characters far enough -actually out of combat- that I could always cast a new invocation when one died. I finally won that fight without a scratch. Smart ? sure. Pleasurable ? Hardly.  So unless you like going very slowly, always moving like there is a fight at the next step (or reloading often), managing inventories to be sure each character has the absolute best equipment, has the necessary consumables,  and so on (i.e. total micromanagement), skip the tactician level. At normal level, the game is going to be challenging enough for most players. Especially the last combat, which I never finished -I have done quite well in the first part, but am hopelessly outnumbered in the second part. I probably know what is wrong, but I won't be going back batching the potions that I am missing, respecing my characters to more useful stats, traits and spells, changing runes for more useful ones etc. you get the picture for tactician level.- So, I won't know the end of the story line I chose, and I won't change my storyline just so the last combat is easier. That's a bit sad.  And NO: YOU CANNO'T CHANGE THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL DOWN! That's a real shame!  Also, there is no excuse for larian in turning an excellent character development/combat system into the mediocre thing that it has become. In that respect, Original Sin 1 was way better. The current system has clearly been designed in order to foil the player and outrageously favor the opponents. You cannot inflict secondary effects (blinding, stunned etc.) as long as the target has magical or physical armor (a new protection that comes above your hit points.) This means that the first rounds of combat are always going to be damage dealing: you won't have any crowd control coming until you've done some attrition first. Worse: the system favors teams which choose a damage type and stick to it. I made the mistake of wanting a balanced party: the result is that I am too weak for the last fight. Actually in some fights, I had characters standing aside, watching the combat go because they did not deal the right kind of damage...  After all this has been said, I still recommend this game because the story looks good, the world is well developped and generally speakig as RPG go, it stands on the top if you don't fall into the trap where I fell.  EDIT: I finally found the courage to do what I said I wouldn't do, and of course finish the game. As expected, I had to respec my characters, and decided to go for lone wolf. The advantage in lone wolf lies not in the power of the characters (they indeed are stronger, but you have overall less firepower), but in the fact that you don't have to bother about the survival or such and such character, as well as reducing the drain on your consumables (you use two instead of four for a similar effect.) The fight was easy [SPOILERS (light) AHEAD] mostly for use of the special tea sold by Mrs Kremm, combined with at least +50% full elemental protection potions and five star dinner -i.e. all elemental damage did heal me, which both let me remove most healing spells as well as use my own offensive spells for healing-, the pawn and duck duck goose (for good movement, not mentioning spells.) Other talents which I thought would help did not (guerilla) [END SPOILERS] ; I changed my main character from pure mage to hybrid melee (fighter) / mage, helped by an archer/assassin ; as explained above, this was a choice to favor physical damage over magical damage, choice made necessary by the difficulty of that fight. I of course had to spend considerable time to prepare the characters and the consumables, buy or craft the required potions and books as well as redistribute equipment. The trouble is that in that fight I did not recognize the character(s) I played consistently from the beginning (no respec before the end), which is annying (to say the least) for a RPG! The other trouble is of course that I could not have to feeling that the hero was well above the other contenders to deserve my victory. Indeed, the stats of all other human opponents were consistently above those of the hero. Understand who can!"
Nekomatagirl,108,1,0,September 4,Recommended,117.0,"--No spoilers--  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a game that at first kind of looks meh. The graphics might not appeal to some and others might find the spells and other things clunky at first. But the game is rather quite the opposite of those problems. It's a great game but a game you need to get invested into. I enjoy the combat greatly because there is so much to do and so much to interact with. I also really enjoy sidequests and this game has a ton of them. There is a lot to explore and discover.  At the time of writing this I have about 116 hours and still haven't completed the game. Do not think that it tastes that long to finish a campaign, but merely there is a lot to look and do. One of the problems of the game isn't even the game's fault. It is the players. Some people drop games or get to busy to continue.  I've restarted the main campaign about a dozen times (sometimes my fault) before finding someone that would go all the way. But it really is a blast when you are with a friend or friends.  Though I must say the crafting system is kind of lackluster when it comes to anything but potion making. I barely use it unless it's to make potions. Some places are annoying to deal with and that one battle with oil slugs or whatever they were called didn't do my computer any good. Loading screens are longish but you barely have to do any load screens at all because the entire map is just available to you. The dialogue and narrator are also one of my favorite parts of the game.   Overall? I recommend it highly! It's absolutely worth it."

So far I prefer the Origin characters cause you're getting more story mode for yourself, instead of just your companions. Speaking of which, the characters have great build, personality and of course, story. Ingredients needed for one to be attatched to a character of your choosing, mine for example being The Red Prince.  Allow me to share a funny tale while I am here...  So I'm in a full party and we decide to pick pocket this guy, but our rogue needs us to distract the guards.

Huge ammount of character customization and reactivity to choices you make it the game with an ending that morphs to your actions.

I used approximately 100 hours on the starting zones alone, and could do it again for 300 more if I would want to.  The game is worth it at full price, even if you complete it once, and the multiplayer is so well implemented. The game feels like a living world with 4 players where you can choose your route or host role playing sessions like D&D in the stage creator.  The game has constant friendly fire, making joking pokes at your friends possible, or even backstabs. Only one can rise to Divinity, and if all of you want to become Divine, wel I can quarantee an adventure full of wonder and explosive action.

The two Divinity: Original Sin games take the concept of co-op rpg to a different level. It allows you to play the game exactly the way you want to. The build variety is incredible and nobody in the party is ever feeling like a deadweight. Sometimes the wizard has better gear or the assassin has found better spells. Some builds scale better into the end of the game then others, but none of that even really matters if you are playing this game, because at the end of the day, this game is just endless ammounts of fun and excitement. The feeling of making a clutch play in this game and thinking with portals in the middle of combat to use your spells in a way you never had before is a glorious feeling. And then there is also saving your co-op partner with a spell or two they haven't seen yet. There are just many good times to be had here. I love this game, and I hope you will as well."
Knightsundere,208,1,0,May 16,Recommended,42.8,"- Prenote - This is a review from the perspective of someone who does not usually enjoy this style of RPG; I usually play action-oriented RPG's that don't use a turn-based combat system (Dark Souls, Skyrim, Devil May Cry, God of War, Metal Gear Solid, etc.). So, this is not a review that should be read by anyone who is a larger fan of these older-style RPG games - waste of your time. If you are one of those people, buy the game, it's right up your alley.   As for those who are new to this genre but heard of this game through glowing reviews and maybe friends, here's what I have to say.   TLDR; The combat is, surprisingly, the most entertaining part, while the story's pacing and general creativity are top-notch for the genre, but comparatively predictable, cliche-ridden, and generic for those who care. Leveling and playstyle customization is awesome, but the world does a not-so-subtle job of locking you out of areas until you've hit the next level.    The Combat: 9/10  I'm a fan of action-packed games with tense, reactionary elements and high mechanical skillcaps, so moving over to Divinity 2's much more tactical and strategic system set itself up as an obstacle for my enjoyment of the game. Surprisingly, it turned out to be my favorite part of the game - combos, while sometimes stale depending on your party comp (running 3 out of your 4 with Battle Stomp gets a little dull against anything less than 3 enemies), prove to be an exciting and rewarding aspect that I had thought gimmicky at first. Mobility is, per the usual in almost all games, the best abilities to have off of cooldown, but nevertheless, almost all builds and classes are very viable in almost every situation (though I don't recommend taking 4 characters who all deal physical damage exclusively).   The Characters: 8/10   Characters and dialogue are all excellently written, though some stand out far more than others (The Red Prince is an absolute must-have, both for combat capabilities and sheer brilliance in writing). Voice acting is additionally top of the line, though, as is the case with most RPG's, you'll start to notice the same person raising the pitch of their voice to act as another character. The singular downfall is that aside from the suggested companion characters that are brought with the player at the beginning of the game, companion options are bleak, with other companions being generic mercenaries hired for coin. It felt odd to see the original, suggested companions popping up throughout the story, as though they could not be replaced with Act-unique new characters. I don't want Beast the Dwarf, I want someone new. But in all seriousness, take. The. Red. Prince.   The World: 7/10   I have little to praise, but little to shame either. The world is top-notch, but falls into an unfortunately generic fantasy RPG rut, with little thematic or aesthetic originality. To some degree, this can be excused as Larian was working off of their previous entry in the series - however, without a strong terrain/world thematic foundation, there wasn't much that surprised me. Without rules of theme set, there is little that doesn't seem out of place, and little that does seem like it belongs any more than the next setpiece.   The Story: 6/10   This suffered from the same issue as the World - though superb in it's own right, the story is unoriginal and fails to make any significant impact on the player besides helping to push them along an ascenion route that summarizes the player's ultimate goal as ""become stronger"". This is hard to avoid when the premise of an RPG of this style is to make the player an all-powerful wrecking machine, but it's also a destination that I wish RPG's in this genre would have the nads to diverge from. I know where the story wants to put me from the very beginning cutscene, and though I don't have any qualms with knowing the good guys win, I at least want it to be less obvious.   Overall, Divinity: Original Sin 2, in the perspective of a non-RPG player, is a strong first game to break into the genre, but worries me to whether I'll like others, seeing as how lauded this one is.   To someone who doesn't typically play these games, I say wait for a sale - you might not get past the slightly weak opening segment.   To someone who does typically play these games, you'll love this one. Gung ho.   "

Almost 50 hours, two playthroughs, one alone, one co-op, will be starting a 3rd one in a week.  it's everything from the first game and better, now you can play as different races, even 4 (6 when released) premade characters with their own origin stories  It's a competitive coop game, basically a mini MMORPG if you have 3 other friends to play with.  the combat has highly improved over the last game, now with bless/curse affecting the surfaces/clouds, the new crafting system and the two new talent trees.   if you want a proper review on this game, either watch all 40 update videos from larian.

The game consists of 4 Acts resulting in 5 Endings (I thought there are 3 endings in total, but no, it's 5, I know right?!)  They vary a lot in the sense of your character-companion relationship development and combat, especially if you play co-op (The co-op is lovely but it can ruin friendships, talking from experience here :D)  The modding community has done an outstanding job, so many custom skills, gameplay enhancement, I've even tried a totally new campaign recently, which bring me to my next point.  Most of my playing hour (2/3) would be the time I've spent on the GM mode, it's a nerdgasm, especially if you spend some time doodling around with the Divinity 2 Engine (around 100 hours in my case) you can make your own game, literally your own RPG adventure.  In conclusion, if you want to play a stand alone single player, D:OS2 will offer you a branching storyline, memorable companion and villians, silly moments when you talk to chicken and cow, and very dark moments as well, if you wanna have a fun experience with friends, again, D:OS2 is even better in co-op, and it's an RPG lover's wet dream in GM Mode.  I've seen some negative reviews about this game so this is regarding those people, do me a favor, if you're not a fan of RPGs and want to beat a game in 10 hours, just go and do that in silence, you're opinion doesn't mean jack after 4 hours of gameplay.  Otherwise, just buy it, you'll get your money's worth."

D:OS really surprised me. I fell in love with that game about forty-five minutes into it. Larian is a great dev. They know exactly what they are doing, and I'm guessing D:OS2 takes what the first did well and does it a lot better. . Wonderful to hear that the PC community is loving this game!  Combat is Amazing and fluent, no deadtime and you always have to plan out your moves in advance.Well thought elemental combat system and seeing how every element such as blood,water,oil,steam,smoke,poison or electricity all behave with one another.   Roleplaying is insane. The amount of way you can solve a quest or a simple situation is astounding and the customization of your build is great, however it lacks in physical customization.  Story is really good, engaging and the world reacts to things you do and feels like a living world. You do not need to have played the previous games to understand where it comes from nor where the story goes.

Grandpa_Wild,170,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,125.8,"9.5/10 so far... In summary this is a very difficult, detailed game with a high skill cieling, plenty of room for experimentation and variation, and lots of replayability value. One does not have to play the first game to enjoy this one; I have not, for the record.   Good: Never been as obsessed with a game since Witcher 3; however, it has much more replayability value due to the incredibily detailed battle system, the multitude of sidequests, the different companions, and practically infinite builds. This game somehow reminds me of Deus Ex and Fallout/Skyrim in that you can accomplish certain tasks in many different ways, which is most evident in the tags system in dialogue. However, in this game, the character you choose/make, the build you create, and the companions that follow you feed into the choices you will make, the way you will fight, and the way you play the game moreso than any game I've played before. This game really puts the ""role-playing"" in RPG. Also props for taking away my handholds, and, for the most part, getting rid of the giant arrow pointing me where to go and just teling me what to do through dialogue, exploration and experimentation.  Bad: Some of the UI and the save system annoy me: I have accidentally walked somewhere instead of reviving a teammate countless times, and one has to get used to quicksaving a lot. These are minor complaints at worst."

"""\(o.o)/""",46,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,167.4,"Honestly, probably the best game I've ever played. Here's why:  -The graphics and spell animations are amazing and hairrising!  -Epic storyline.  -The fights are satisfying as hell, and you play by your own rules, and your techniques. Whether that being to just stand face to face to the enemy, or hide behind walls and place traps to checkmate.   -You can fail quests in this game, but it won't make you lose or have to redo everything.  -You choose your style of playing, you can be the kindhearted hero who helps everyone and doesn't harm a fly. Or you could kill every single person you can find, you can still proceed in the story, although they may have different outcomes.  -There's a way around everything, stuck somewhere? For example [SPOILER ALERT]  If you kill Migo, his daughter won't give you any keys, but you could always steal the keys or kill her, and other than that, there are atleast 1 more way inside.  -The way the elements work is logical and epic, throw a water baloon at someone, then cast a cold spell, poof, they're ice (unless they have resistances)  -You don't need to know a single thing about the first game, in fact, I never even knew about divinity: original sin before this came out, nor have I cared to play it, and I'm totally fine.   -Doing kind acts that won't seem to give you anything in return (such as giving free gold to a random npc), are most likely to give you something in return in the long run. Such as discounts for what they're selling.  -Choosing your skills and talents can make your story go in a different direction. I mean, there's a talent for speaking to animals...who don't wanna talk to their pets??? And sometimes they also have important information  :)  -I could go on but I'm lazy and I wanna play now...so..ye...xD  (This is the first review I've ever done, and I've owned steam for MANY years, that should say something about the game)"

Jestertitan,37,1,0,May 11,Recommended,396.6,"I have been a Steam member for, oh I'd say 15+ years, and have never cared enough to write a review.  I am so passionate about this game that I felt inspired enough to write my thoughts.  You can get the highlights from other reviews, but I just want to share my feelings because I'm very meticulous when I buy a new game and I read all these reviews.  I have over 350 hours into this game so far, and I'm still on my FIRST PLAYTHROUGH!  Now, this is due to my playstyle.  If you wanted to blast through the game I'd imagine I could in 50 hours or so, but I like to get all I can out of a game, and boy does this game have a lot.  Between the music, phenomenal gameplay, graphics (mine are low though because my computer sucks), and mostly the story.  What a great story.  Up there and maybe even better than witcher 3.  I put 700+ hours into skyrim and I can see myself playing through this game another few times to top that, and I haven't even gotten into the multiplayer yet.  If you like RPGs and turn-based games, or story-rich games, then this is for you.  There are so many variations you can play through between all the different builds, skills, spells, potions, crafting, etc.  This game is right now my favorite of all time, or at the very least top 5 all time of any game type, and I consider myself a moderately hardcore gamer with decades of experience gaming.  You will not regret this purchase.  People say there are bugs but I personally have not experienced any.  Most of the time people complaining about bugs is them just missing something, be it a hidden door, or stat effect that they don't know changes something.  I haven't experienced a single bug, maybe because I bought the game late after fixes.  Either way, buy this.  You won't regret it."

yasen400,161,1,0,June 27,Recommended,33.8,"6/27/2018  Right, so thus far I've played for ~17 hours and I gotta say, this game is great.  So why is it great?  I started this game expecting my years of experience with rpgs to make this game a breeze. Oh boy was I wrong. This game punishes you for not equiping both you and your teammates. DON'T FORGET TO EQUIP YOUR TEAMMATES.  for the record I was playing it on classic difficulty(normal).  All I did in these 17 hours can be summed up in 2-3 sentances. Later on I found out that I could have done the progress I did in those 17 hours in less than 6 hours. So here's what happened to those interested:  I got on a prison island and met up with a few companions, I got equipment and got myself arrested hoping to get into the fort joy castle. I did and from there I escaped through the front gate. Then I met up with the resistance and got a superweapon to destroy the enemy superweapon in order to get a ship to get out of the island.  In any other game this would take place in the span of 1-2 hours and would have no player control. You would be doing a sort-of ""tutorial"" and by the end of it you would be set free (kind of like in every elder scrolls game). However in this one the tutorial is you playing. You are trying to get off the island, the game is not going to help you, giving you waypoints and saying ""HEY DUMBASS GO TO THE GUY I'VE MARKED ON YOUR MAP AND TALK TO HIM AND THEN COME BACK"". The game is going to tell you to do something and you have to figure out how/when/with what to do it. Like for instance 1 quest generally is listed as a jouranl. and as you gain more information about how you can complete the task/quest that journal fills up with info that you've learnt through exploring/conversing/fighting. It doesn't show you a magic waypoint to your next objective, nor does guide you as to what you should do(or what you will encounter). After escaping the fort I found 150000 different (WAYYY easier) ways of escaping the fort that could've saved me like 5-7 hours of playing. This is one of those games where there are so many ways you can do something you will probably never see all the things you could've done in each given scenario. It kind of reminds me of a more refined ""Hitman: Blood Money"" in that way.  I haven't touched the coop, nor Gamemaster, nor Arena modes, however that is what I'm going to be diving in once I complete my playthrough and master the mechanics.  GameMaster I'm really interested in, seeing as I love the idea of actually playing a DnD game with actual game mechanics and a GM."

Kear,86,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,27.5,"By modern standards this is a stellar RPG. Planescape Torment meets Diablo II.  The four man coop and a GM mode (4 players, 1 GM) is icing to an already luscious g√¢teau."

Undercover,84,1,0,April 3,Recommended,196.2,"Given how little I've played of this game in comparison to how long it is, I probably can't paint you a 100% accurate picture. However, from what I have played, holy cow this game good. I played the first Divinity, and it was astounding how good everything felt; from the co-op, mechanics, to the story, it had it all. This game is that and then everything else you can probably think of, especially with the utter and complete lack of new and good rpg's/co-op. If you're looking for an immersive environment, a great co-op game, or all around just a good time, this is a definitely worth a look."
SilverGhost,42,1,0,"October 18, 2017",Recommended,104.9,"I blinked, and 100+ hours later i'm playing my 2nd run through of the game as Lone Wolf. There's so much to discover, and redo that you can only do this game justice by playing it twice and that's not including the re-rolls when you first start.  There's not much to be said that hasn't been said already - I will say that this game plays smoothly and beautiful on my older gaming rig (7 years old), GTX 750 TI.   I recently tried playing Warhammer II and it was so sluggish - i know it's apples and oranges, but i didn't want to spend $2k upgrading my machine.  Point is, there are amazing games like DOS2 that are far more accessible, and far deeper than a lot of the fancy games out there."

Gulthor,136,1,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,208.2,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is an isometric computer RPG in the tradition of old-school pen & paper RPGs (such as Dungeons & Dragons) brought to the digital age.  In DOS2, you'll take on the role of one of six characters (or create one of your own) to explore, interact with friends and foes through interesting dialogue options, and engage in tactical turn-based combat encounters.  Whether you build your own character or play through the story of one of the six Origin characters, you'll be able to fully customize your character by choosing skills, assigning attributes, and picking talents that all synergize to make interesting and unique builds that change your options for interacting with the environment, with NPCs, and in combat.  As you play, you'll recruit the aid of up to three other characters (chosen either from the remaining available Origin characters or hired from a mercenary captain), but be warned; while choosing to travel with fellow Origin characters will open up new and interesting storylines to explore, your goals will sometimes be at odds. Like your main character, you'll also be able to customize your companions, creating a party that can stand up to the challenges that await you.   Alternatively, play with up to three additional players, and explore Rivellon together in jolly cooperation.  Although DOS2 is not procedurally-generated, and encounters are placed and not random, the choices you make and actions you take have long-term consequences that can dramatically alter your play experience, but in a way that feels surprisingly natural - even intended!  DOS2 is complex, and what seems intimidating to start quickly becomes a deep and engaging experience that both challenges you mechanically and drives you on to experience more and more of the story it has to offer."

Razor,235,1,0,"May 31, 2017",Recommended,594.3,"My words can not do this game justice, it's a masterpiece, and it's not even fully released yet!   Almost 50 hours, two playthroughs, one alone, one co-op, will be starting a 3rd one in a week.  it's everything from the first game and better, now you can play as different races, even 4 (6 when released) premade characters with their own origin stories  It's a competitive coop game, basically a mini MMORPG if you have 3 other friends to play with.  the combat has highly improved over the last game, now with bless/curse affecting the surfaces/clouds, the new crafting system and the two new talent trees.   if you want a proper review on this game, either watch all 40 update videos from larian.  Or you know, JUST BUY IT.  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -    Updating my review from the Early Access  After spending hours and hours of playing the campaign, I still stand by my review from the early access, I want to tell more about this game cause I simply adore Larian now.  The game consists of 4 Acts resulting in 5 Endings (I thought there are 3 endings in total, but no, it's 5, I know right?!)  They vary a lot in the sense of your character-companion relationship development and combat, especially if you play co-op (The co-op is lovely but it can ruin friendships, talking from experience here :D)  The modding community has done an outstanding job, so many custom skills, gameplay enhancement, I've even tried a totally new campaign recently, which bring me to my next point.  Most of my playing hour (2/3) would be the time I've spent on the GM mode, it's a nerdgasm, especially if you spend some time doodling around with the Divinity 2 Engine (around 100 hours in my case) you can make your own game, literally your own RPG adventure.  In conclusion, if you want to play a stand alone single player, D:OS2 will offer you a branching storyline, memorable companion and villians, silly moments when you talk to chicken and cow, and very dark moments as well, if you wanna have a fun experience with friends, again, D:OS2 is even better in co-op, and it's an RPG lover's wet dream in GM Mode.  I've seen some negative reviews about this game so this is regarding those people, do me a favor, if you're not a fan of RPGs and want to beat a game in 10 hours, just go and do that in silence, you're opinion doesn't mean jack after 4 hours of gameplay.  Otherwise, just buy it, you'll get your money's worth."

raycyden,28,1,0,"October 20, 2017",Recommended,722.5,"I played Divinity Orginal Sin first. I was shocked that there was not more buzz about that game and I was wondering what type of improvments could be made to make an already amazing game better. Well imo they did it. I suggest playing one of the orgin characters first. They each have their own back ground stories which just adds to the depth of the game.   If you like to custimize your characters (you can still custimize orgin characters class and appearance), if you like interactive worlds, if you like loot, if you like a rich story line, and if you like challenging game play this game is worth your time.   These are not 'fetch' quests, they do not feel repetitive, and there is not a marker to tell you where to go to next. So by exploring, speaking to npcs, reading your log book, and using logic quests are solved that way.  If I had a complaint it would be at times I felt like I couldn't 'help' an npc but there were many more times that I could.   11/10"
Dog Dreams,234,1,0,"October 20, 2017",Recommended,77.9,"This game is fantastic, let me get that out of the way first.  It has a gripping story and an extremely fun intro sequence that will keep you glued to your seat for hours. The story you start with is really just a set piece you have to follow, but there are tons of quests hidden within the world that you will find by accident most of the time. This game truly embodies what it is to be an RPG. It simply let's you do everything you want(within reason and without going to an A rating), you can be a hero or villain, coward or brave fool, sneaky assassin or loud barbarian, etc. etc. There really are too many scenarios to think of, but the game really makes you feel like you are in control of your future in the game.  There are some problems though, certain boss battles are kind of cheap since the bosses have to do certain things so they can one shot you or skip party members leaving you to watch your team die one by one. The second act is by far strongest, totally eclipsing the 3rd act and making you kind of have to drag yourself to the end. A few of the quest lines seem broken tbh, there were certain times a quest didn't end or just didn't proceed for no reason, even though these were small side quests I was still frustrated at not having been able to finish them. Also, there is no autosave feature, so sometimes you'll get into a fight you can't escape from and are too weak to win, so you'll die and reset to a save file from a half hour ago because you're not really used to saving, not gamebreaking, but extremely annoying, especially in a game like this. Other than that I don't really have any complaints.  I really recommend buying it, I guarantee you'll get your money's worth very easily and have a great time developing your Godwoken into true Gods!!!  Right now I'm eagerly waiting for whatever expansion is to come."

Mellow,334,1,0,June 1,Recommended,101.2,"What can I say about Divinity? It is a series I remember stumbling upon ages ago, but never really gave a fair chance. After playing D:OS2 I can safely say that was a shame. OS2 has easily become one of my favorite games. The gameplay mechanics are neat (even if RNG can be frustrating at times) and its visuals are spectacular. What really makes the game shine however is its story elements. OS2 has such a fleshed out story with options that branch out in so many ways that it really seems absurd at times. Rarely can I say that a game really made me question each interaction I had with the various characters strewn throughout. In my time playing there have been many moments where I participated in an event, met a NPC, or even stumbled upon a secret that made me think about what I wanted to do the next time around. What if I befriended so and so NPC next time? What happens if I don't help that one guy? What if steal the key and check that basement? Absolutely great game, I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes games with powerful storytelling."

Literal Potato,227,1,0,May 30,Recommended,87.1,"TL;DR: Extremely well designed RPG overall, Great visual/graphics, Engaging and well written story, deep, fun, and challenging gameplay, would totally recommend this game if you are a fan of the genre  Aesthetics (Graphics, Visuals, Music): Absolutely top notch- the amount of detail in this game is astounding on a visual level. From each character looking fantastic, to the detail in spells and animation, to the level of beauty in the environment, overall this game looks great. The only drawback to this is that it's more demanding, resource-wise, than similar games. The music is also phenomenal and really follows the mood of the story without being too intrusive.  Gameplay: the combat system in this game is pretty similar to other CRPGs, but goes above and beyond. My personal favorite touch is the amount with which the environment can contribute to combat scenarios. There is a small learning curve which basically makes it the Dark Souls of- just kidding. There is a weird issue with balance where being overleveled by just 1 or 2 levels makes some fights trivial while being underleveled by 1 or 2 levels makes some fights annoyingly difficult, but overall, the game seems to do a good job of leveling the playing field... unless you're like me and added a mod that doubles the amount of enemies. One thing that is really underappreciated is how civil abilities affect gameplay. Characters have to balance environment and gear interactions, stealth skills, luck, and persuasion/bartering all in one pool of points. This can lead to balanced jack of all trades (master of none) characters, or min-max characters. This game also allows a lot of freedom in how to play by deciding lone wolf or travelling with a full party and by allowing you to constantly respec yourself and your companions.  Story: Extremely deep and interesting. I have found myself underwelmed by  lot of RPG stories as of late, thut this game was definitely an exception. Each of the comanions/prebuilt characers have their own stories which are fairly interesting but the main story and most of the side quests are captivating. There seems to be just enough instruction that you have an idea what to do, but this game will definitely not hold your hand and tell you exatly where to go. You can get lost or have absolutely no idea where to go, but it doesn't take a lot to get you back on track. Decently replayable - story length can be 30-70 hours depending on how into the story and side quests you get.  Notes: I haven't tried the multiplayer or GM mode yet"
Imperius,72,1,0,May 30,Recommended,107.3,"Didnt know i could like a turn based game so much. Never played FF so this was a great first game to try in the genre. Basically a D&D campaign in video game form. My preference in games is that there is an rpg element and this one satisfied that need. Fun to play with friends albeit it very slow. Replay value is low if you play on the hardest difficulty first and some of the skills for solo make the game very easy. Still very fun, by on sale."
Autumn,113,1,0,May 30,Recommended,74.0,This is probably one of the greatest RPG ever made. Turn based combat with a huge variety of builds allows for very imaginative playthroughs combat-wise. And the infinite amount of decisions that you can make throughout the game adds for replayability only to see even more of the story. 10/10.

yasen400,161,1,0,June 27,Recommended,33.8,"6/27/2018  Right, so thus far I've played for ~17 hours and I gotta say, this game is great.  So why is it great?  I started this game expecting my years of experience with rpgs to make this game a breeze. Oh boy was I wrong. This game punishes you for not equiping both you and your teammates. DON'T FORGET TO EQUIP YOUR TEAMMATES.  for the record I was playing it on classic difficulty(normal).  All I did in these 17 hours can be summed up in 2-3 sentances. Later on I found out that I could have done the progress I did in those 17 hours in less than 6 hours. So here's what happened to those interested:  I got on a prison island and met up with a few companions, I got equipment and got myself arrested hoping to get into the fort joy castle. I did and from there I escaped through the front gate. Then I met up with the resistance and got a superweapon to destroy the enemy superweapon in order to get a ship to get out of the island.  In any other game this would take place in the span of 1-2 hours and would have no player control. You would be doing a sort-of ""tutorial"" and by the end of it you would be set free (kind of like in every elder scrolls game). However in this one the tutorial is you playing. You are trying to get off the island, the game is not going to help you, giving you waypoints and saying ""HEY DUMBASS GO TO THE GUY I'VE MARKED ON YOUR MAP AND TALK TO HIM AND THEN COME BACK"". The game is going to tell you to do something and you have to figure out how/when/with what to do it. Like for instance 1 quest generally is listed as a jouranl. and as you gain more information about how you can complete the task/quest that journal fills up with info that you've learnt through exploring/conversing/fighting. It doesn't show you a magic waypoint to your next objective, nor does guide you as to what you should do(or what you will encounter). After escaping the fort I found 150000 different (WAYYY easier) ways of escaping the fort that could've saved me like 5-7 hours of playing. This is one of those games where there are so many ways you can do something you will probably never see all the things you could've done in each given scenario. It kind of reminds me of a more refined ""Hitman: Blood Money"" in that way.  I haven't touched the coop, nor Gamemaster, nor Arena modes, however that is what I'm going to be diving in once I complete my playthrough and master the mechanics.  GameMaster I'm really interested in, seeing as I love the idea of actually playing a DnD game with actual game mechanics and a GM."

Though the ending was a bit of a let down (too easy / quick), overall we had a great time and I recommend this highly. The combat is great and the learning curve was satisying for us.  Plenty of gameplay value for the price!"
kokane,18,1,0,July 3,Recommended,62.4,"As with its predecessor from 2014, Divinity: Original Sin II's setting remains the D&D-infused fantasy land of Rivellon, but the clock has been moved forward centuries from the original game so you don't need any familiarity with the backstory to quickly get up to speed with what's going on. You take on the role of a Sourceror, a name referring to those that draw arcane power from a mystic material called Source. This substance is controversial in Rivellon, because using it seems to inadvertently summon interdimensional monsters known as Voidwoken. Deploy Source powers and these bizarre creatures show up to kill everyone in sight. Because of this, you're viewed as a danger to society by the Magisters, a governing body of inquisitors and warriors who claim to serve the Divine Order and protect society by rounding up and ""curing"" Sourcerors.  This epic saga is a big undertaking. Expect to use up the better part of 60-70 hours to complete the main quest line and a good portion of the many side quests. The story isn't just extensive, though; it's detailed and gripping, largely due to how it avoids good-versus-evil fantasy archetypes common to RPGs.   The Good     Spectacular scope and depth that could easily keep you playing for over 100 hours      Detailed plot set in a world that seems completely lived in and authentic      Expansive tactical combat with seemingly unlimited options based on spells, skills, gear, and ever-changing battlefield terrain      Deep character creation and customization options due to extensive ability and skill options      Beautiful visuals along with an evocative musical score and impressive voiced dialogue   The Bad     Confusing journal makes it hard to keep track of individual quests and the plot     "

Mystic Pizza,80,1,0,"June 28, 2017",Recommended,48.1,"Going to keep this one short and sweet.  If you are fan of tactical old skool CRPG's or RPG games with immense depth in lore, combat and building a character exactly the way you want it then DOS2 is an absolute must buy. This really is the benchmark of just how deep RPG's can be.  Larian are easily up there with the greats like CD Projekt Red as a dev who are truly passionate about making great games for the fans and listening to what the community wants.   This is not just the RPG of the year, this could very easily be GOTY 2017, hands down.  If you are new to the genre, the learning curve can be a little steep. DOS2 will not hold your hand, but the journey is well worth your time and to get the full experience of every aspect the game has to offer, you have literally 100's of hours of epic RPG goodness ahead of you.

CptRagebeard,104,1,0,April 20,Recommended,112.1,"This game is, by far, the best RPG game I have ever played in the history of all my 20 years of gaming. I cannot wait to put thousands of hours into it. The only issue I have with it, however, is how limited the character creation system is, but I guess no game can be absolutely perfect. That said, here's why I love this game and will enjoy playing it for likely years to come.  The story:  I've only ever gotten so far as ACT II, but even still, the story in that time is so rich it'd put the CEO of the Amazon corporation to shame. The openess of the story makes for excellent roleplay elements. It'll keep you hooked and wanting more and more the further you delve into it.  Gameplay:  The only class restrictions are literally how you choose to build your character because of where you choose to put your attribute and ability points. That sky's the limit, and any kind of character imaginable can be built and played in this game. I would even go so far as to say this game is the closest game to a D&D simulator there can be without actually being D&D.  Combat:  Generally, I'm not a fan of turn-based combat outside of games like CIV games, but the system for this game really takes the cake. While the combat is turned based, the way it's set up to function is absolutely marvelous. The great minds at Larian Studios definitely didn't go wrong with it--at all.  Customization:  This game is open to steam workshop elements and modding. It also has a Dungeon Master aspect that allows you to create and run custom campaigns for you and four of your friends. However, I recommend playing the game as the vanilla version before adding mods to it, as some of them can be quite game breaking. Trust me, though, you absolutely won't regret it.  All-in-all, this game is pretty much perfect minus my only aforementioned problem with character customization. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this game and have absolutely nothing but good things to say about it! I give this game a 9.9/10."

JOHN BUTTMADDEN,261,1,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,201.0,"Do you like strategic roleplaying games like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, Arcanum, Fallout 1 & 2, Dragon Age (the first one), or XCOM 2?  Well, you're going to love this.  This game combines the roleplaying depth of Dungeons & Dragons with a strategic feeling similar to XCom 2. Practically speaking, what this means is that outside of combat, you can do damn well near anything you can think of. In combat, you can do the same. If you want to break into that house, kill that lady, steal that gold, and escape into the night, you can. If you want to be the daring hero, and save shackled stowaways on a sinking ship, you can. This game gives you the freedom to truly explore the ""RP"" factor of Roleplaying games. Very few games these days can hold a candle to the amount of roleplaying this game encourages.   I think a number of groups of Dungeons and Dragons players will likely abandon tradtional and even virtual play, and just move their games over to Divinity: Original Sin 2. It's easy to learn, hard to master - not unlike D&D - and it's also aesthetically gorgeous in both music and graphics. Can't recommend this game enough. Buy it."

Pebble,64,1,1,"October 5, 2017",Recommended,174.9,"This game is an unchallenged masterpiece which single handedly has saved the rpg, dungeons-and-dragons-esque style that many people love and many games fail to pay homage to.  Story: When I decided to replay the game I expected to run into the same encounters and same experiences again so that I could make better choiced. However, that went‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•up when I made 1 or 2 tiny different choices and ended up getting completely new missions and encounters, it was as if I was playing an ENTIRELY new game!  Performance: I have just above the recommended hardware for this game and for the 100+ hours that I have played this game not once have I had to lower the graphics from the highest setting and I am always getting 60+ frames.  Controls: Although overwhelming at first, the controls become natural relatively quickly and can be utilised as you see fit, I have run into no inconveniences so far. However it did take a few hours to get used to having to use the middle mouse button so much! (middle mouse used to swivel camera)  Overall the game is near flawless and I don't see myself getting bored of it any time soon! :)"

angryhamster,17,1,0,August 27,Recommended,138.9,"I don't ever do reviews normally because I always think, why the heck would anyone be interested in what you've got to say?! lol! But this is how strongly I feel about this game!   A bit about me ('cos hey this is what you came to read right?! Nah, I just thought if you're like me you might enjoy this game too) I'm a 37 yr old female gamer and I love games ranging from GTA:V, Mass Effect, Battlefield, CoD, The Elder Scrolls Online, Skyrim, Dishonoured, God of War, The Witcher 3, Final Fantasy to Stardew Valley, Command and Conquer, Tropico etc, as well as all the retro Nintendo classics on NES, SNES, N64 and Gamecube etc.  So I've got a pretty eclectic mix of games I like, and I'm definitely not a gaming pro, more a casual gamer who just happens to get absolutely addicted to great games!  I stumbled on this one day browsing my queue and I'm beyond happy I did.  I actually think the storyline's ten times better than Skyrim (and boy do I loooooove Skyrim!).  The graphics are stunning and the music is so on point it's unreal. I've sank over 130 hrs into DOS:2 and if I didn't work full-time for a living I'd have probably sank in triple that amount, this is how engaging I've found it so far!   From having played games like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Neverwinter Nights back in the day, DOS:2 immediately caught my eye as I fancied a nostalgia trip.... but damn it was SO much more than that! The narration is brilliantly engaging, witty and fantastically acted, and the love that Larian have put into building their characters backstories is blindingly obvious and unparalleled.  There's so much depth in there and it's so well padded out that I honestly can't fault it in the slightest.  Larian just became one of my favourite studios and I wish I'd known about DOS:2 when they were securing funding over on Kickstarter, because hell yeah I would have backed them!  The only thing I struggled with to begin with was the difficulty, in that modern games tend to spoon feed us tidbits and tips on what we should be doing in a game, they're full of map-markers and quest highlights on the map etc. specifically guiding us to the people and places we need to see, the tasks we need to do.  DOS:2 on the other hand demands that you think on your feet and outside the box! Sure it has a journal function with your quests loosely written in (actually in a journal format though), but it's absolutely down to you to work out how to accomplish that quest and there's zero hand holding.  But to be honest with you, it's actually something I've come to love about this game, for once it's a game that actually really requires to start using your brain, otherwise you're going to miss key elements of a fantastic story.  Enough waffling from me, just do yourself a favour and if you love RPGs of any kind, buy this! - I'm over 130 hrs in and I'm on Act 4 already looking forward to my next play through!"

First few minutes in it I wasn't stoked - turn based gameplay didn't set right with what I'm used to, I wasn't familiar with the Divinity series, and some of the bits of lore seemed funny. I'm glad I got past those first reactions, as the game opened up into the largest, most mind-bogglingly adventure I've played, and all of the lore became less funny and more 'real' and important. I'd put this past Skyrim in how much I've enjoyed a game. Sunk 30+ hours in the first week. Great job Divinity team - I'm excited to finish this and play the sequel (*fingers-crossed*)."

If you are on the fence about turn based rpgs then this game is the one that will make you change your mind.   Pros:  Looks good.  Plays well.   Many hours of content.  Many skills come with classes.  You can make any build you choose.  Rich Story.  Worth the money compared to other games by far. Cons:   The start is very slow and can be hard on the higher difficulties untill you get geared.  Limitied camera options. Felt like it could zoom out further at times.  I give Divinity Original Sin 2 a 9 out of 10.

Tacocat,118,1,0,September 25,Recommended,55.7,"What a masterpiece. I definitely struggle from indecision and incompletion when it comes to computer games, but this one will be played in its entirety.   It has all the depth of Witcher 3, with a play-at-your-pace turn based combat system that lets you relax, pick the right move, and dominate your opponent with tact rather than hack n' slash quick thinking.   10/10. Managed to play 50 hours in less than two weeks while also studying for Medical School."

noot,610,1,1,"December 29, 2017",Recommended,95.0,"tl;dr:  Divinity OS2 is one of the best RPG's and one of the best Co-Op games out right now, and quite possibly the best game I have played in years.  A friend of mine got me this game as a Christmas gift, and I have not been able to put it down since. I enjoyed Divinity OS1 before, but this game manages to outdo it in most aspects still.   The story is amazing. It truly makes you feel like every small decision you make matters, and changes both the course of the game, the way your characters personality forms and how they interact with party members and the world in general(and obviously how they react to you as well).   Most if not all dialogue is fully voiced by great voice actors(including the narrator), the sound track is atmospheric and immerses you straight into the fantasy world, and the graphics and world design are gorgeous.   When I played the OS1 for the first time the slow-paced combat kind of turned me off at first (I thought it was quite hard to survive, and kind of confusing), but once I got more into it I grew to like it, and with Divinity OS2 all my doubts about the turn based combat have vanished. It is a lot of fun to plan out your next moves with your friend. The game wants you to be creative and tactical in combat, so you better not try to run head first into every fight, or else you will probably end up dying many times.Rather you will often use the environment to your advantage( which reacts to pretty much anything you do ) applying status effects, luring enemies away to overwhelm them in numbers and combining elements with your party members to cause havoc.   The companions have rich stories, are fully voiced and quite interesting (I had a hard time picking a follower because they're all quite cool).   That's pretty much all there is to say: if you like (Old-School) RPG's and don't mind the slower paced more tactical combat system, this is probably the best game out there right now."

Starting from Betrayal at Krondor, Baldur's gate, Neverwinternights, Icewind Dale, Dragon Age-this game trumps it all. I'm still just 90 hrs into the game and this game blows me away.

The Fleshining,114,1,0,July 3,Recommended,69.7,"Have you ever asked yourself what would happen if they could make D&D into an actual videogame? Well look no further! I've been on the fence about buying this game for a while, I finally picked up this game on sale and I'm so far 17 hours into playing this game. All I can say is this may be the greatest RPG I have ever played. Does it have the greatest graphics? No. It is mouse click controls as opposed to WASD. This game more than makes up for all of that with the richness of it's story and lore. In additition the character customization as well as the sheer amount of decisions you can make to complete a quest are vast and astounding. For a game that is not that graphics intense it is still 26 GB and you can see where all that memory goes. You can talk to every single NPC and animal (if you have that skill) in this world and they all have a voice you can actually listen to. You can kill any NPC you want but keep in mind that everything has a consequence in this game. Combat is interesting and again, depending on what skills you have, can be approached in multiple ways depending on the challenge. You can be a ranger with wings, fly up to the high ground and have a tactical advantage. Have a battlemage, shock the most powerful foe, stun lock him while the rest of your party kills all the others. Be a rogue and give every enemy the suprise buttsecks.... everything is a possibility in this game. If you have looked at the game description and been intrigued but maybe not convinced to buy this game, don't even think about it just buy it. You will get your money's worth. This is a game I see myself replaying multiple times in the future."

I normally don't review because I'm not the type, but so many people are giving thumbs down because of day one server problems and it isn't in their language yet. If you're not incredibly impatient and like turn based RPGS, this is a must buy. If you like DND this is a incredibly huge must buy. The game's normal mode is a bit difficult though, so if you are new to turn based RPGS start on the easy ""explorer"" mode, and if you are experienced with Turn based games start on the ""normal"" mode. You will defintely be challenged in normal mode."
SeanTheSugoi,173,1,0,"September 15, 2017",Recommended,105.7,Probably the most fun I've had in a game in a very long time. Combat is indeed deep and sometimes you'll end up doing more damage to your team than your enemy would.

I started playing on tactician, and yeah, some fights really suck but it makes it all the better when you win them and get sick‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•loot. The armor system is interesting. It took some getting used to but it's a pretty decent system when you think about it. The combat is phenomenal and has only improved since DOS1. Origin characters have great story behind them and everybody has their own motives and goals. Whether you work together or not is decided by how you play. All in all, This game is badass and I'm only 1/4 of the way through. I have noticed bugs here and there but I haven't experienced anything game breaking. When these are patched this game is an easy 11/10.  TL;DR: This game is a gem of an RPG. It doesn't hold your hand and that's one of the main reasons it's damn good.

It feels like a D&D game story-wise and the decisions you make can have big consequences. Combat is awesome - complete with terrain variations, elements, and explosions. You control all characters in combat which means you aren't just stuck with one playstyle or character type. If you enjoyed the Dragon Age series this game will definitely pique your interest.  The music is awesome and powerfully sets the mood.  The only negative I really have is the pacing can sometimes be slow. Just go into the game with the understanding that it's going to take awhile if you plan on doing most of the content.   Due to how many plot choices and party choices you can make in a playthrough, I just beat it and am already mapping out my next playthrough!"

First few minutes in it I wasn't stoked - turn based gameplay didn't set right with what I'm used to, I wasn't familiar with the Divinity series, and some of the bits of lore seemed funny. I'm glad I got past those first reactions, as the game opened up into the largest, most mind-bogglingly adventure I've played, and all of the lore became less funny and more 'real' and important. I'd put this past Skyrim in how much I've enjoyed a game. Sunk 30+ hours in the first week. Great job Divinity team - I'm excited to finish this and play the sequel (*fingers-crossed*)."

I ended up picking up this game for full price (because the first game seemed to absolutely refuse to go on sale for more than 50%.) It supports 4-player coop which is fantastic -- the first game seemed to only allow two. As such, this title is my first entry into this series.  As for whether I feel let down yet, well... it's been 44 hours now, and I still haven't finished exploring the starting island yet, much less figure out how to get off it. I'm having a blast so far; There's a bit of a learning curve if you're not used to Divinity's large amount of inter-play between various game elements, so it feels deeper than your typical RPG's.  The only downside is that things can tend to take absolutely forever early on when you have to spend multiple minutes planning each battle. It almost feels like playing Civ.  I might update this whenever I advance past the starter island..."

Gjunki,12,1,0,March 23,Recommended,201.8,"Can quite honestly say that Divinity 2 is one of the greatest turn-based RPGs of our time. The mesmerising storyline and great character development makes it feel more like a book that you help write an ending to, rather than a standard RPG. The combat system feels very fluid for a turn-based system, and is extremely intuitive (throwing an electric spell on a pool of water will zap everyone standing in it, lighting an oily area on fire have its own array of effects, back-stab with daggers for 100% critical hit chance, positioning yourself at a higher vantage point than the opponent for high-range percent bonus damage, and the list goes on). Would recommend to anyone who wants to add a fantastic RPG to their library of games. Can't wait to play the first, and next, installment."

I absolutely love the sanbox/rpg/turnbased combat I was thinking it would be something akin to Hand of the Gods of Hi-Rez studios ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•game imo) but the combat feels as fluid as turn based combat can be; theres no grid that your forced to be on, attacks can be landed at just the right distance between two opponents to hit both, combos are easy to set up and rewarding to pull off, and most of all  This game is actually difficult.

D:OS really surprised me. I fell in love with that game about forty-five minutes into it. Larian is a great dev. They know exactly what they are doing, and I'm guessing D:OS2 takes what the first did well and does it a lot better. . Wonderful to hear that the PC community is loving this game!  Combat is Amazing and fluent, no deadtime and you always have to plan out your moves in advance.Well thought elemental combat system and seeing how every element such as blood,water,oil,steam,smoke,poison or electricity all behave with one another.   Roleplaying is insane. The amount of way you can solve a quest or a simple situation is astounding and the customization of your build is great, however it lacks in physical customization.  Story is really good, engaging and the world reacts to things you do and feels like a living world. You do not need to have played the previous games to understand where it comes from nor where the story goes.

Grandpa_Wild,170,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,125.8,"9.5/10 so far... In summary this is a very difficult, detailed game with a high skill cieling, plenty of room for experimentation and variation, and lots of replayability value. One does not have to play the first game to enjoy this one; I have not, for the record.   Good: Never been as obsessed with a game since Witcher 3; however, it has much more replayability value due to the incredibily detailed battle system, the multitude of sidequests, the different companions, and practically infinite builds. This game somehow reminds me of Deus Ex and Fallout/Skyrim in that you can accomplish certain tasks in many different ways, which is most evident in the tags system in dialogue. However, in this game, the character you choose/make, the build you create, and the companions that follow you feed into the choices you will make, the way you will fight, and the way you play the game moreso than any game I've played before. This game really puts the ""role-playing"" in RPG. Also props for taking away my handholds, and, for the most part, getting rid of the giant arrow pointing me where to go and just teling me what to do through dialogue, exploration and experimentation.  Bad: Some of the UI and the save system annoy me: I have accidentally walked somewhere instead of reviving a teammate countless times, and one has to get used to quicksaving a lot. These are minor complaints at worst."

It expands heavily on the tactical combat and player choice of the first game in ways that few to no other RPGs of it's kind has ever done. I'm several hours in and have only cleared the initial starting area and apparently there are still HOURS and HOURS of main quests, side quests and other diversions to go. The voice acting is great. The loot is great. The characters are in depth and amazing (even talking to animals you will find that they are highly unique and have diverse voice actors!). The replayability in this game is very high as well as you can always tackle quests and situations in NUMEROUS ways. This game is so far from linear it puts similar games to shame.

Icethrill,72,1,0,August 1,Recommended,67.3,"Highly recommend it! This review is based only on CO-OP as I have only played this game mode.   ++ CO-OP is sooo nice! Must be one of the best games for that.           And like Diablo, multiple players can play on the same computer which makes it very appealing! ++ Classless so you can mix and match while you progress and learn new spells ++ Tackle the quests as you see fit (killing or persuasion for example)  + Multiple ways to go from a point A to B.... so one can sneak or go ""swords blazing"" + You can murder everyone without blocking quests givers (killing a guard will not hinder your progression)   +- Story can be uninteresting for some side quests but it is mostly very good  - Speaking of which: story can be hard to follow as you do other side quests - Finding the right trader: it can be tiresome to run from one to another to see what spells they could be selling  -- Understanding at the very beginning how to complete quests (quests markers are strange) can be a chore. I have used a lot online guides because it's quite unclear at some points "

PurpleXVI,650,1,0,"September 26, 2017",Recommended,179.7,"This is a good game and you should buy it.  ...  Now if you actually want the REASONS why, rather than trusting my impeccable judgment...  Music: AAA+ Graphics: Good and easy to read, amazing design on a lot of stuff. Performance: Pretty good, high settings on a medium-tier setup and it runs just smooth except for one or two rare places where a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• of things are happening at once.  And then there's the gameplay and writing. Now, the writing has some ups and downs, but mostly ups. There are one or two places where they tried a bit too hard to make something gross, or got a bit too flowery on the prose, but by and large, the writing works. If you hate a character, you can tell it's because the writers wanted you to feel that way about them, not because the writers couldn't figure out how to make them sympathetic. Storyline's interesting and has enough twists to keep you interested, but with enough info that they're not Shyamalan-esque, rather, you have a good shot at guessing them ahead of time if you're observant, which is satisfying.  The gameplay is... if you liked the original Original Sin's gameplay, take that, then improve it in literally every way. And also prepare to be punished, viciously, if you're playing on Tactician mode(which of course you are, you want the most challenge out of this, don't you?) but encounters rarely feel *frustratingly* difficult. The game will happily let you wade into fights or areas that are way out of your depth, so sometimes you need to step back and gain some levels or gear in other places first, but unless you're actively sabotaging yourself with a build you know to be terrible and have no synergies, there's always a way, it just requires you to think creatively and maybe not engage enemies that are four levels above you AND outnumber you two to one.  The only downsides is that the game is a BIT buggy. Occasionally some fights will hang on start because enemies won't figure out they need to take their turn(only had this happen once in close to 100 hours of play, mind you), some quests won't finish properly(probably because you can sometimes start quests by finishing them or picking them up halfway through their storyline by stumbling on a quest-vital NPC or note), the journal is a bit useless and something is VERY wrong with the lizardman consulate area.  Also loading times in the second area, the Reaper's Coast area, are a bit atrocious due to the size of the area. Even on an SSD.  Still, cosmetic issues, for the most part. GET THIS GAME."

The story is engaging almost entirely through story-telling (it's not highly interesting on its own). The gameplay is tons of fun if you like turn-based combat similar to DnD. You can make your character how you want OR play through as one of the prebuilt characters. If you make your own, fear not, you can recruit up to three prebuilts as other party members and experience their story that way. Each one is interesting and unique, and can play any class or build you want them to. I highly recommend the game!!"

parched_poet,101,1,0,June 3,Recommended,133.1,"Probably the closest a game has come to recreating the feel of old-school pen & paper campaigns, with near-limitless opportunities to express your character through carefully designed encounters. Captivating visuals, amusing dialogue, engaging and well-acted companions, a deep combat system, and a not-too horrible story. What's not to like? In every detail you can feel the love Larian poured into this game. Also, you can convince dogs and other household pets that all life is fundamentally meaningless, which elevates D:OS2 into legendary status for me. A++ would recommend."
p0llen,108,1,1,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,39.5,"first serious review in my steam career!   As this games is being hyped AF currently i wanted to add my (more critical) perspective.  Highly anticipated sequel to Larian Games' Divinity: Original Sin 1 that continues the pros and cons of the first iteration. Divinity: Original Sin 2 has been in early access and was recently released to steam as ""full"" title.   Pros:  - good artdesign and graphics  - highly polished, no crashes, bugs, solid performance  - multiplayer (2-4 players) easily set up via steam overlay  - good voiceacting covers more or less all dialogues in the game and the majority of the dialogues are written well  - vast amount of races and classes to choose from during character creation  - heaps of abilities to utilize in combat - fights are highly tactical (different armor classes, combination of elements like water and eletricity) and quite difficult which makes them very engaging  - lots of hidden secrets to discover in the world (caves, shortcuts, loot chests, etc. etc.)  - multiple ways to solve quests (sneaking, slaying, talking)  - neat crafting system  - intense dialogue systems with various dialogue options and different outcome based on your dialogue choice    Cons:  - no ""visible"" character progression on level up as new abilities are exclusively acquired via skill-books that are (rng) looted from enemies or the vicinity leading to the effect that your whole gang levels up but you essentially use the same skills for 5-6 levels or even longer - that can get really boring and grindy eventually  - 0 player guidance which can cause confusion and feeling overwhelmed (quests,  - unfair design decisions, i.e. resurrection of fallen party members post-combat needs to be done with scrolls that are very expensive and hard to get; this greatly slows the whole flow down (note: im certain there is a resurrection spell that can be learned, but you need to find it based on rng - see point above)  - overall sense of ""low powered fantasy"" as your gang is wearing rag armor and no helmets even after 10 hours into the game (which also intensifies the difficulty)  - larian games is famour for their ""humour"" - i sometimes find this style of homour ""childish"" and i think it doesnt really fit into a violent, medieval style world but that of course is personal gusto   all in all a very good RPG with lots of clever ideas, highly functional mechanics and solid storytelling. it does however fall short on character progression and should sometimes offer more guidance for players.   8/10  "

Goose,277,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,161.1,"To say that this is a great game, actually does it a disservice, it is a phenomenally made game with amazing RPG elements and spot on tactical gameplay.   At first I thought the game was a bit overbalanced on the NPC's side,  but ended up finding out that it was just me.  A few key gear purchases and suddenly I was taking out fights that I had an incredibly difficult time before.  The combat does a great job of making you feel powerful while never making it feel easy.  Your tactics matter.  From your choices of companions (and what specializations they have) to the positioning on the battlefield, to trying to create your own ambush instead of getting ambushed is just amazingly done.  The game does not hand hold you along, but at the same time it does not feel hard to keep up with all the different quests and side missions that you have on your plate.  Not every fight is meant to be tackled the first time you see it and the game rewards you for taking out something in an ingenious way with an every increasing power level on your gear.  You are always advancing in one way or another.  I never write reviews, this is probably my first so hopefully that says something.  Such an amazing game, do yourself a favor and buy this!"

Nirb,155,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,352.8,"Had a lot of difficulty fighting a mini boss in the prisons of fort joy. He was in the middle interrogating another person with a swordsman by his side and 2 archers on opposite ends of the room ontop wooden platforms.  So eventually I devised a solution through trial and error. I got my weakest character to enter the room causing the boss's dialogue to cause them to enter a conversation. I then snuck in my rogue and back stabbed one of the archers (and turned him into a chicken). Next came my wayfarer, using fossil strike and a fire arrow I blocked the enemy from approaching my backline. Afterwards my summoner made a bunch of creatures. Poison, explosions and madness ensued  While all this was happening the boss was still casually talking, replying to my threat 'That's cute.' with a rogue behind him, 4 summons next to him and a wayfarers crossbow aimed at his skull. On fire no less.  10/10 No regrets best game 2017. I didn't think I needed it, but found out it was all I ever wanted."

Newberg,257,1,0,"October 25, 2017",Recommended,162.1,"Fantastic strategy RPG that doubles as a platform for online D&D.  Pros: -80 to 100 hour campaign -Massive replay value -Fun and creative turn-based strategy combat -Completely free-form leveling system -After the beginning area you can respec all your characters for free forever -Every line of dialogue is voice-acted, complete with an amazing narrator -Comes bundled with a complete creation kit you can use to make mods, maps, and campaigns -Easy to use co-op, plus a GM mode. -You can kill anyone you want. -No forced morality system. -Quests are very creative and usually have different and interesting outcomes.  Cons: -Tactician mode (hard difficulty) requires you to cheese most fights -Usable items you pick up will automatically be placed on your hotbar, cluttering it unless you manually disable that option -Some quests can be bugged if you accidentally do things before the game expected you to. It's never game breaking, but it can be annoying having unfinished quests cluttering your log. -Ambient voice acting gets very annoying, especially if you are at a vendor sorting out your items to sell and you have to hear the same line from nearby NPC's over and over. -Sometimes it's hard to select specific targets if there's a lot of things near eachother, and the slightest movement of your mouse can accidently change your target just as you cast your ability.   All in all, one of the best RPG's to come out in a long time and I highly recommend it."

B√ºrgermeister,140,1,0,"October 11, 2017",Recommended,129.1,"At first I was hesitant at getting this. It looks great, and like a lot of fun, but maybe not worth the price. I thought maybe I'd pick up the game on a sale or something.  But I'm very glad I got it.  The story is very rich and there's so many ways to play. I'm excited for my second and third play throughs.   You can steal from anybody, kill anyone, befriend NPCs, talk to your followers if you choose to have them, and each story is different from character creation. Each race is treated differently, you have different dialogue options if you're an Outlaw, or Scholar, or even if you play a smart Wizard, you can persuade people with your smarts, or intimidate people with your strength.   The combat is very fun, and comboing spells and attacks is awesome.  Classes aren't really set in stone either. If you're a Fighter but decide you want to shock people, or grow some wings, you can very much do so.   And the GM mode is amazing.   As a Game Master for D&D games, I've always wanted a game to play it in, to immerse the players, and let them explore with out having to explain every small detail. And this game does it very well. You can create custom items, NPCs (even down to what hat they wear), allies, and customize the pre set maps the game gives you. I would honestly buy a DLC that includes more maps. But there are plently right now, I'm just afraid that through multiple play throughs we'll all think ""Oh, this map again.""  This game is a masterpiece, but it's not perfect.  The combat is very hard, even on the easiest difficulty it sometimes feels like I need to kill a couple NPCs who don't deserve it so I can level up and continue the story. And sometimes this makes the game feel linear. I don't know if I'm missing something, or I chose bad classes for my party, but either way that's a big down side for me.  That being said, at the time of posting this review I'm 71 hours in, and I havent even completed my first play through, which is a good thing. I'm taking my time, exploring the world, talking to every NPC and living the world.  UPDATE (very minor spoilers):  I finished the game, and I have to say while the ending was good, it was very buggy. I was unable to use res scrolls, enemies would teleport everywhere, and some other minor things.  Arx also felt very bland for what it could have been. Driftwood and all of Reaper's Coast felt huge, and there was so much story there, but Arx... You were there for one thing, and that was to beat the game. I tried to find more to do there, I tried to find side quests, just anything, but there was nothing. Maybe I missed stuff, maybe I didn't. Either way I feel the game no longer deserves my original score of 8.5/10.  8/10"

Delu,705,1,0,August 4,Recommended,70.1,"The game is simply amazing and that is pre upcoming Definitive Edition extensive Update.   One thing I would like to see changed/ revised is that often when you get into cinematic style close up conversations, the NPC you talk to is visually cut off in odd places, usually the head. So you happen to talk to a lot of headless NPC's and a large portion of the screen is filled with Text, so instead of listening and enjoying the view often there is an accidental forced focus on that text and only little visible parts of NPC's at odd angles. If it actually works right on the other hand you see the usually bland facial expression of NPC's but still a large portion of the screen is covered with text. It feels like this could be done better in both cases as it disctracts a lot.  Otherwise an amazing game I highly recommend playing."

David Knight,493,1,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,80.9,"Okay, I've been holding off on reviewing this for the game to be fully released. I felt that making a review of an unfinished product would be unfair to the company and their hard work. With that being said...  This game is a single/multiplayer RPG that features ""competitive co-op"", in which you play one of several pre-made characters OR a custom character. From my experience the custom characters have far less story and interactions than the pre-made characters. This is because your race and your origin are one in the same. I feel like this is a lost oppurtunity and makes all the custom characters feel a little more samey than if you could be a dwarf sent to assassinate someone or a lizard that's also posessed by some sort of ethereal being like a demon. Instead we're left with the custom characters having nothing unique about them other than their racial traits. To combat this, the pre-made characters can be of any class and have any ability. Which allows you to play any class you want while retaining the amazing work put into their pre-made stories.   UNFORTUNATELY, there isn't a premade character of each race. There are no undead dwarves, undead lizards, or undead elf companions, Which sucks, since my favorite race is the undead elf (for Corpse Eater on an undead).  The crafting system feels a little less intuitive than before and more divorced from the game and it was a feature I kind of overlooked as I quickly forgot all about it. Though you are reminded of it by ONE quest I came across while playing, but beyond that, you'll run around looting EVERYTHING in hopes that combining things in your inventory will produce SOMETHING of use or value but later, usually while selling things in town, you'll completely forget about what you were doing and sell either all of your ingredients only to remember you were saving them for ""something"".  Beyond these two issues, the gameplay is SOLID! The combat grabs your attention and lets you plan your moves carefully so you can combine abilities and environmental hazards, the voice acting is spot-on, the story is well written and easy to follow. Multiplayer and co-op features a seemless drop-in drop-out system, giving players 2, 3, and 4 control of one (or more) of the companion characters following you around. Multiplayer and singleplayer savegames are interchangable... And the loot. I'm ALWAYS scouring the ENTIRE map for more loot.  Which reminds me, I strongly recommend you read every book and note you find, They sometimes add context to what you see in-game.  So, with all that in mind... Do I recommend this game at it's current sale price of $45? I'm actually torn on this one. I LOVE the game, don't get me wrong. I'm about to go play it RIGHT NOW... but... is it worth $45? That's only $15 less than a AAA game, featuring higher quality graphics, full 3D animation, more cutscenes, a stronger focus on character-integration, usually a more intuitive crafting system, but... it's still a solid RPG and I think EVERY library of RPGs wouldn't be complete without it. SO, to a person who is a die-hard RPG fan, yes... it would totally be worth it but if you're on the fence about this game AT ALL... wait for a sale."
PRID8R,628,1,0,April 15,Recommended,108.2,Love this game. I finished DOS1 and got straight into this one a few days later. Absolutely love both games but DOS 2 takes what made the first game great and turns it up to 11. Combat is extremely fund and quite complex but rewarding. The management of skills allows so much freedom for experimentation. I found myself changing up my charachters completely evey once in a while to see what other playstyles were available.   Absolutely recommend for anyone who liked the original and like rpg's in general. Tactitian mode is a beast though so prepare yourself if you are going down that route.

Young Metro,137,1,0,"October 26, 2017",Recommended,139.4,"First off I should start by mentioning that I'm completely new to the series, never played during beta nor have I ever played dos1.   This game is by far the funnest and most intricate rpg I've ever played, grants you a proper adventure with plently of opportunity to try out different quest paths and exhaust dialogue influenced by the high-fantasy elements affecting the world. Richly written with all this dialogue I love the option to choose between race based dialogue, character trait, or even using the basic ones avaiable to all characters, the twists on the options and the options themselves are beautiful, extending side quests, opening up quests, or even resulting in a consequence later on ingame. I haven't progressed too far in the game so I can't really speak much about it but this is already based off of the 14hrs of gameplay i have thus far (which is increasing in increments of 5 with each passing day) but i'm hooked. Been up until 4am constantly playing because of how grasping this game is.   Overall game has -great adventure with plenty of exporability -rich writing with plenty of dialogue  -plenty of ""oh you can do that?"" moments  - graphic beautiful -great quests - plenty of classes each with a choice of 8 races to choose from (4 plus the undead) with a wide variety to play - hybrid builds  -CREATE YOUR OWN CAMPAIGN  -great challenging combat  my only dislike to this game being that my friends and I, do to different work & school scheds creating our own runs of the game, and i'm unsure if you're able to carry one character over from campaign to campaign. Not a huge deal but sometimes i feel it's better to have say your cleric that you needed for your party brought over to your second game, instead of creating a new cleric altogether."

airkerma,56,1,0,March 23,Recommended,273.8,"This is an excellent game which I really enjoy playing. However, I feel that it does fall short of the first game. Things seem to drag on much longer and I find myself looking up how to get past certain parts routinely. A few puzzles can be fun, but when it's more of a feature than a bug that you either have to look these up or spend hours reading all possible texts, it's gone too far. The battles are easily the best part but again, they're not without drawbacks. Almost anytime you lose it's because you ventured 1 foot outside of where you were supposed to be. Many of these battles are instantly unwinnable until you level up again. It's not even worth testing yourself against a foe one level higher because they'll bust out some insane‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•on you and it's over in a turn. The formations don't seem to stick. They keep reverting to the most useless base formation so that everybody dies at the same time when a cursed fireball comes your way. Finally, I can't seem to save different characters so that if I wanted to have a co-op guy and a single player guy, they overwrite each other. Don't get me wrong, I love the game, I just find that it's overly time consuming to the point where I just look everything up because I don't have 4 hours to burn on some cucks missing sock or whatever."

Scominggregor,204,1,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,102.9,"Ok so during the early Alpha I was extremely concerned about the Magic and Physical armor which blocks CC, damage and status effects. Early on, it was incredibly tedious and there weren't  many ways that you could remove the armor without burning cooldowns or wasting many turns using your basic attacks. Also the enemies had double the armor you had so they would be able to land spells and cc on you much earlier than you could to them.   With that said, that aspect is still part of the game but to a lesser extent. They added new spells to target certain types of armor and overall, it just feels like I can break through the armor easier and be able to use my spells to their full effect. I don't feel as frustrated anymore and I've actually grown to like the armor system because certain enemies have more or less of certain type of armor. Caster will have lots of magical armor so you want to send in your dude with lots of physical attacks and lock him down.   I can't recommend this game enough. This is my third edit of my review (it was kind of a mess in aplha/beta) and in its current state I can absolutely recommend this game because of it's great role play elements and tactical combat."

I'm exttremely happy with the skill balancing that they accomplished before release as I have yet to feel that any of my builds have been as OP as some of the ones I and others came up with in Early Access.  The combat is challenging on Classic Mode and BRUTAL on Tactician, not just because the AI is so good, but because the shear amount of skill options you have at your disposal is nigh overwhelming and I love it!  The voice acting adds a lot, the new animaations for deaths are kick‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•and I can't wait to move on with the overall story in Act 2.  Also, the real consequences of some of your companions' choices are so very cool - in particular Sebille and Lohse.  I haven't even looked into GM mode yet, but just watching that Matt Mercer video on youtube lets you know how powerful and streamlined that part of the package is.  Almost bug free on my run so far too, which is another huge feather in their cap.  Awesome job again Larian!

Pawnda,262,1,0,February 21,Recommended,420.7,"Although this game is confusing at the very first time I played, especially about questing-story related and class management--this game is big great. This game has unique element of job you play, you will be given a full control of your character you want to be--I mean, you can really mix between one type of class and another to suit your playstyle. The RPG is good, combined with RTS battling system. The story is tailored by how you play it, you can skip the whole part when you want it to be skipped, but note that I don't recommended this whole story skipping thing because you will miss a lot of quest to makes your character strong.  Pros: - Narrator things at conversation like I were reading a book, I like it because I'm a writer, so this one suit me; - The graphics is decent, but not that spectacular, I give it 7/10; - You can talk to every individual, some gives you quest, some gives you lead to something. And every individual you can barter with; - Co-op (multiplayer or split-screen); - Character development, progression and decision making is three things important; - Has hidden things everywhere, puzzles are that makes it a big plus; - Clever AI and challenging environment to fight in; - The linear story is somehow amazing to me, plus there are total six different origin characters that has different story, and at top of that you can create your own character - Worth hours of gameplay (in different playthrough).  Cons: - The conversation system is just not my type; - Lacks of tips and tutorial as this game showed only for previous Divinity players; - Journal seems to be confusing because the finished quest or something like that doesn't moved to Archieved side automatically, and sometimes bugged and can't be done although it's actually done; - It's not friendly for a new player of Divinity series as showed above--lacks of tips and tutorial. You will only see a few of this along the games, and it seems not very helping either; - Some feature you couldn't understand after a few hours of gameplay; - Few minor bug (some related to story that makes it gamebreaking bug, but fortunately there are other way to approach).  9.5/10 hope I played this game earlier xD  EDIT ---  Definitive edition has some major improvement. But yes, no game is perfect.  Pros: + Beast's story is improved a little bit; + Arx got a lotta change; + Sir Lora; + Journal; + Some elements got nerfed and buffed.  Cons: - Changelog says that Retribution should be attractive to enemies, and I don't see the difference. - Bugged quests (as far, I got only two bug, one at the bloodmoon island called ""Shackles by Pain"" or something that we have to fight possesed dwarf. Two at Lohse quest called ""Crippled the Demon, I can't snuff out the candles and the dialog just give me ""turn away"" choice at the first candle. Update: I can snuff out the first candle by using tornado skill, weird, and the second candles snuffed without any problems, the third/ thousand candles are also without problem.)."

If you want a highly strung Inquisitor who just happens to be able to turn their arm into a tentacle and wack people with it, you can get that straight off the bat +Great narrative that has a long length, with an old-school DnD DM-like Narrator evoking the emotions and facial expressions of the party and NPCS +Complex choices that have lasting effects +Sikk loot comes often and looks great +The world design is beautiful, varied and surprising. +Well Optimised +Has 4 player Co-Op +Has a mode where you can be an actual DM +Sounds Design is great, a variety of atmospheric tracks, and tempo changes acording to current events. eg. tempo increases during battle +Combat is very very deep and complex, but still fun. Though takes a bit of creativity to really get the game to show its masterful design. Use those arrows, bombs and spells you might otherwise forget!  It would be very hard to list all the great things about the game, but here's a few negatives:  -I have lost server connection with my friend a few times while playing. About 3 times in 70hrs. still not bad, but be aware that you should save often. -It is time consuming, be prepared to forget about some things if you leave space in between play sessions  That's it.

Deltarizon,104,1,0,April 6,Recommended,175.3,"Well lets start off with a brief description of the game. You're a captive on a ship, a Sourceror, one of the most hated people across the land. Your foul magic attracts monstrosities known as the Voidwoken, nightmares from another dimension that seek to claim this world as their own. However, things quickly roll out of hand, and it ends with the ships destruction. Finding yourself on the prison island known as Fort Joy, you discover that you're no ordinary Sourceror; you have the potential to become a GOD. From there, the game plays out quite literally as YOU choose it, be it as a benevolent hero seeking to save the world or as a malicious villain who seeks to gain ultimate power. And, just maybe, you'll find an option that no one else expected, one that takes you through the Void itself... and finding power that scoffs at the Gods themselves.  As you can probably tell, there's a lot of choices to be made in Divinity 2 : Original Sin, and maybe you're thinking ""Oh god, it's another one of these games that plays out as a visual novel instead of a rpg"". Well if you are thinking that, shut the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up, strap in, and read up ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• because there's quite a bit more to the game than that.   Now, the best part about this game is it's combat system and character progression; there are few other games where I can actually feel the progression of my character and the impact it has on the world around me. For example, in my very first TRUE playthrough of the game, 100% it, I did it with just two characters, both of them basically assassins; it was hard at first of course, but by the end of the game I could clear a room of 12 heavily armored characters with 2 characters and taking no damage. It truly felt powerful, and is one of my favorite gaming playthroughs of all time. So I thought, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it, lets try a magical playthrough, might not be as fun as the first, but we'll get through it. Well. Lets just say a full elementalist party is quite a unique experience. The whole 4 person party felt powerful the entire game, and we destroyed everything in sight that we deemed ""Unholy"" or ""Unclean"". Felt ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing hilarious the entire way through, and I don't regret a moment of it. For my thrid play through, I went in with a full melee team, and got the exact same results, which has blown me out of the water and clear into the sky; the fact that no matter what kind of team you play you know you'll become a force to be reckoned with is fantastic, and lets you cook up some pretty kooky team compilations. If you don't believe me, go on youtube and look up some of the SOLO builds people can make; they play on the highest difficulty and can quite literally nuke entire areas with a single character. But I digress, that's a bit off topic, and not relevant to this review. So if you've ever felt let down by a characters power or capability, trust me, you won't feel that with this game.  Let's talk diversity for a quick second here. There are 4 main races in the world, the Dwarves, Humans, Elves, and Lizards. Each race has its own unique capabilities, and it's own racial traits, meaning that yes, while you can have a Lizard assassin, making it a human so it have bonus initiative (how soon it gets to move in combat) and extra critical chance (random extra damage) means you'll have an easier time. Or maybe you'll choose a lizard for your geomancer because you have the innate ability to breath fire, and ignite your oil based abilities. A dwarven Inquisitor stands ready to rush into your opponents because they have extra defenses against all forms of damage. And maybe your necromancer is an elf because elves can eat parts of their enemies to learn memories and skills they'd normally never obtain. No matter what it is, you'll find tons of combinations based off of race alone to make a unique and fun character. But is that where it stops? Nope, that's where we're just getting started. See, there is a unique twist you can put on a character; you can make them UNDEAD. Yes, that's right, a skeleton that walks and talks, and which offers other unique pros and cons. For example, an undead character will heal when poisoned, and take damage when healed normally. Skeletons can use their bony fingers as infinite use lockpicks. And most importantly, Skeletons don't have any nasty organs to inhale Deathfog, an uncommon terrain in the game which kills anything that breaths it, meaning that Undead are free to wander through it as they please. The only real downside is having to wear a headpiece at all times. (Which isn't even a downside, like, why would you decide to not wear an important piece of equipment?) But lets say you dislike making all of that troublsome character stuff, you just want to get in and have fun. Well, there are already a ton of premade characters with their own stories and quests to go on if you so choose! There's literally no way to go wrong with making a character in this game!  Hey, we almost missed the most important part of the game, the part where you become a god and stuff! Well friendo, that's what I saved for last because that‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•is called SPOILERS, and I know that some people dislike those. So let it be said now that if you don't want to read any spoilers WHATSOEVER, then you should skip the next paragraph. Cool? Cool.  So as your character progresses through the game, they will discover the ability to use Source to fuel abilities. These are their godly powers, and are only usable by player characters and certain other npcs. This includes the abilites; Bless : Buffs an ally and clears any and all curses that afflict them. Spirit Vision : Is actually free to cast, and lets you temporarily see into the spirit realm, where you can see parts of the past, and even talk with the dead to gain their wisdom. (Or even just to taunt an enemy who bugged you.) Devour : Not it's actual name, but I don't use it often enough to remember it. It's also free to cast. You basically target an enemy corpse (or even just directly target their ghost.) and devour their essence, regaining a source point. Doing this too many times however can mark you with the ""Villain"" tag, which is not what you want to have on you if you're roleplaying as a benevolent hero. Gate : Again, isn't the true spell name, but works the same as the D&D version, creating a permanent link to another location within range that anyone can go through at any time. It sounds kind of dumb at first, but it lets you pull off some pretty wacky stunts in the game, and I've taken it on every character I've made so far. There are of course tons of other abilities that can be fueled by source points, far too many to list them all here, as each class has a few ""Ultimate"" abilities that you need source to use. But if you're interested in learning more about these godlike powers, then just look up a class guide and check out their abilities to get an idea of what you can work with!  Alright, well I think that if you've read everything I've said so far, that you'll get the idea I'm trying to tell you. The game's fantastic, and fun to play, especially with friends. One of the best campaigns we had was one where the entire party split up and fought to become the ultimate character. So if you enjoy shennanigans like that, and you love the sound of this game, then take a go at it! I really think that you'll enjoy the hell out of it!"

It even doubles your approval for this game if you are a RPG/D&D fan! The genre ""RPG"" is not used lightly, you are going to have the greatest immersive, and also vast experience this year.  So far I prefer the Origin characters cause you're getting more story mode for yourself, instead of just your companions. Speaking of which, the characters have great build, personality and of course, story. Ingredients needed for one to be attatched to a character of your choosing, mine for example being The Red Prince.  Allow me to share a funny tale while I am here...  So I'm in a full party and we decide to pick pocket this guy, but our rogue needs us to distract the guards.  So I pick mine and I end up getting into a romantic relationship at the very moment with this human thug named Butter.

Grim Onyxheart,293,1,0,May 9,Recommended,85.5,"Really like this one. Huge ammount of character customization and reactivity to choices you make it the game with an ending that morphs to your actions.

frontman12,374,1,0,"December 8, 2017",Recommended,63.4,"7.5/10  I played Divinity: Original Sin 2 with a group of friends as a Persuasive Lizard, focusing on Summoning and Geomancy. Though the boulders and oil that can be thrown with Geomancy are effective, I initially focused on it to serve as a healer for our Undead tank. Undead are healed by poison, so your party's usual healer can't help them out. However, Geomancy also gave me access to Fortify which I could use to restore physical armor, and Artillery Plant, which was my favorite thing in the game. Artillery plant is a summon that exists in the Geomancy tree, whose level is determined by your Summoning skill. In the game, your most powerful skills cost ""source"" to cast (sort of a special type of mana). By the end of the game, you will be able to possess three source points at a given time. Source is rare to come by during most of the game, and even towards the end it's not necessarily unlimited. Artillery plant costs a single source point to cast, but then it can cast an extremely powerful spell called ""Acid Spores"" every two turns, among other strong abilities. If your character were to cast ""Acid Spores,"" instead of the summon, it would cost you two source points every time!  The type of discussion you see above is what makes Divinity: Original Sin 2 so exciting. How can you support the other characters in your party in combat, and what is the optimal way to use your source or action points? If a member of your party has the ""Loremaster"" ability, you can examine enemies to learn their abilities, talents, and resistances. If an enemy reduces and redirects damage dealt, you may want to attack his friends first. If he has the opportunist talent, you do not want to walk away from melee range as it grants him an attack. If he has a fire resistance of 150%, fire will heal him. You want to constantly take stock of enemy composition and the skills of your party.  If Divinity: Original Sin consisted of a more linear story with more combat encounters, and lasted about 2/3 of its current length, it would be a 10/10 game for me. However, as it stands, I have a few gripes.   Although I'm sure that many players appreciate the ability to complete quests in multiple ways, I just found it frustrating. Some of the solutions are obtuse, and require a lot of poring through documents. Some of the late game puzzles, like pulling levers in a certain order or playing the enormous ""pipe dream"" game, were just tedious. There are many many quests, and in a multiplayer party it just felt like I was always receiving experience from somewhere because someone in my party was progressing on one of the many many quests in my quest log. While I'm sure some might say that I should've played with a different group of people, there are so many quests with so many solutions that often we made quest progress by aimlessly walking around.   Another issue I had with the title is just how quickly my character advanced. Each character has a maximum of 40 in an attribute, a maximum of 10 in each skill or combat ability, and a maximum of 5 in each civil ability. Each character in our party maxed out at least one of these categories well before the end of the game. In addition, the highest tier of skills in the game become available at level 16, also well before the endgame. Though perhaps others are drawn primarily for the story, this severely hampered my enjoyment of the game. After learning all skills I was interested in, maxing my summoning and my persuasion, I just didn't have as much to look forward to.  I enjoyed most of my time with Divinity: Original Sin 2. The argument could be made that this type of game just isn't for me, but I enjoyed the combat so much that is was worth some of the other irritations."

PLayed the D:OS EE when it came aout and found this already supererb but the 2nd part can even top this. The story is awesome, the level of detail and the love the developers packed in almost everything is just mind blowing. You can spent hours just listening to characters, speaking with NPCs and enjoy the environment. Not that you have to, but you can. where you have to follow dialogs for quests they are to the point but entertaining and really drag one into the game.  PLayed the storyline in Coop with a friend (2-2) and also the coop gameplay is double+. turn based combat along with the deep strategy and knowledge of your skills make fights extremly challengeing and rewarding at once. Sometimes a fight can take an hour - but you won't feel it.  BOTTOMLINE: fi you are into RPG, go get it - it is a 100% buy recommendation. and when out, buy the D:OS EE, too even at fullprice still the game is worth it.

In terms of strorytelling, this rpg provides an immersive experience with a story you won't guess from the first gameplay hour. It's epic and it's character dependent (to a point). The optional pre-made characters enrich this story, even if the player does not play one (they can also be rectuited as party members).  In terms of rpg gameplay dynamics, the potential this game offers for character skill variation can result in absurdly overpowering characters, yet the level progression system somehow compansates; resulting in a feeling of powermonger.  On top of these, all dialogues are voice acted, graphics are beautifully stylized (ne can especially find the richly colorful style goes quite interesting with story) and the game camera works wonders.  As a result, I was quite happy that I backed this game and it was honestly better than I expected."

Play alone (like i do since friends didnt come with the game) or play coop which your friends can drop in and out anytime or get straight into the fight with the PVP Arena mode.    The good stuff:  -Interesting main/side story and meaningful quest (no more of that boring fetch or kill this mobs quest) -Play as 1 of the 6 origin character which have predefined backstory and unique events. -Or create your own and team up with those origin character. -Dynamic relationship system which your companion can either hate/like you or if you like become intimate with -Owh did i mention that you can play as an undead that ripped other people face to use as a mask? (both origin and custom character) -Your choice and action effect the story and the game (so dont think that people will not notice that apple you just stole) -Challenging combat which force you to use every trick up your sleeve (no more potion/scroll etc that you will probably never use till the end) -Do things your way.Be persuasive,do favors or even do the exact opposite of that favor or just kill the guy and loot him its up to you. -Fully voice acted and beautiful soundtrack that fits the theme of the world -Alot of other interesting stuff like crafting,surface effect etc that you can use to your advantage or be use againts you. -Explore the world and be rewarded for it or suffer for it (who knows,you could find a curse helmet that may contain an evil spirit inside it)    The bad and not so bad stuff:  -Bugs,this game is not totally free of them.I havent found any game breaking bugs yet but remember to keep saving every 15-30 min or so.F5 quicksave is your friend here dont relied on autosave to much.  -The combat difficulty can sometimes spike alot that it can be brutal to new players,i suggest starting the game on the easiest mode (Explorer mode) and get a good feel of the game first before jumping on the more harder one like Classic mode.  -The armor system seem to have alot of mix opinion among the community (Its was absent in the first game).What this system does is that you cant apply debuff like stun to the target unless you destroy their magical armor or physical armor depending on the debuff.The good thing  is that it also apply to your party meaning that your 250 physical armor warrior can just go in and cut down those archer at the back without the fear of being knocked down and your party dont have to be feared of being 1 shotted by some enemy mage AoE spells at the start of the fight.The bad  thing is that enemy usually have 2x or sometimes more armor than you,this forced the player to make a burst dmg character to quicky remove that armor which in turn  limiting the player to mix their classes without hurting the dmg potential the character can dish out per turn.   Overall the game get a solid 9/10 from me and 1 of the few game i dont mind paying more money.Unlike some of the game that we get now that doesnt fit the unreasonably high price tag (Looking at you *AAA games*)"

Pawnda,262,1,0,February 21,Recommended,420.7,"Although this game is confusing at the very first time I played, especially about questing-story related and class management--this game is big great. This game has unique element of job you play, you will be given a full control of your character you want to be--I mean, you can really mix between one type of class and another to suit your playstyle. The RPG is good, combined with RTS battling system. The story is tailored by how you play it, you can skip the whole part when you want it to be skipped, but note that I don't recommended this whole story skipping thing because you will miss a lot of quest to makes your character strong.  Pros: - Narrator things at conversation like I were reading a book, I like it because I'm a writer, so this one suit me; - The graphics is decent, but not that spectacular, I give it 7/10; - You can talk to every individual, some gives you quest, some gives you lead to something. And every individual you can barter with; - Co-op (multiplayer or split-screen); - Character development, progression and decision making is three things important; - Has hidden things everywhere, puzzles are that makes it a big plus; - Clever AI and challenging environment to fight in; - The linear story is somehow amazing to me, plus there are total six different origin characters that has different story, and at top of that you can create your own character - Worth hours of gameplay (in different playthrough).  Cons: - The conversation system is just not my type; - Lacks of tips and tutorial as this game showed only for previous Divinity players; - Journal seems to be confusing because the finished quest or something like that doesn't moved to Archieved side automatically, and sometimes bugged and can't be done although it's actually done; - It's not friendly for a new player of Divinity series as showed above--lacks of tips and tutorial. You will only see a few of this along the games, and it seems not very helping either; - Some feature you couldn't understand after a few hours of gameplay; - Few minor bug (some related to story that makes it gamebreaking bug, but fortunately there are other way to approach).  9.5/10 hope I played this game earlier xD  EDIT ---  Definitive edition has some major improvement. But yes, no game is perfect.  Pros: + Beast's story is improved a little bit; + Arx got a lotta change; + Sir Lora; + Journal; + Some elements got nerfed and buffed.  Cons: - Changelog says that Retribution should be attractive to enemies, and I don't see the difference. - Bugged quests (as far, I got only two bug, one at the bloodmoon island called ""Shackles by Pain"" or something that we have to fight possesed dwarf. Two at Lohse quest called ""Crippled the Demon, I can't snuff out the candles and the dialog just give me ""turn away"" choice at the first candle. Update: I can snuff out the first candle by using tornado skill, weird, and the second candles snuffed without any problems, the third/ thousand candles are also without problem.)."

Dellecross,14,1,0,April 28,Recommended,21.7,"TL;DR  7/10 score from my side.  Longer read  - It is a good RPG game. It follows good ways of approaching the genre. And it attempts to fix problems the first game had. - There are some things which still call for improvements. But it's probably not something which will make you hate the game.  Very long read  Awesome:  - Story. Well, this is as much as it states. Who doesn't want to become a divinity? And you decide which path do you take to get there. - Combat geometry. Altitude and different surfaces make it feel great and diverse. You really want to position yourself right. You really want to make use of surfaces or prevent enemies from doing it. And in most of the cases  - you can/ - Voice acting. They have every little dialog covered and I think at least 7-8 different voices, that's great - Game looks. It is about world and is applicable for those who have fairly good PCs. Speaks for itself.  Good - They improved the initiative problem. As any turn-based game, the turn order will make it a problem of stacking the speed/initiative/whatever serves the turn order boost. Here it's no more so much of an issue. - Many immunity talents are removed which is a good decision. It's just too much of a mandatory pick in the first game. - Not such huge power creep. Over the course ov the levels, like till 15-16, you don't feel the exponential numbers growth. So it makes it managable to plan the combat - Minor fixes like ranged weapon influencing bows AND crossbows. It may be not so impressive, but when combined - it leaves a good feeling  Not-so-good (what made it 7 out of 10)  - Cannibalist elves. I mean, yes, one can argue ""you live with stereotypes"" - and I can't deny it's partly so, but look - if you're taking a race which is invented long before you and make it into something that's completely opposing the perception of majority - it will get tricky. If they would not call these guts-devouring people elves I would have no questions. But it's a bit over the board  - Overall game characters design. Lucky me, I play male characters where appearance means not so much. But I would imagine a disappointment for those who plays female characters. I just wonder how they managed to create face presets which seem to compete each other in ugliness. Oh well - it's about personal tastes, sure - but still.  - Items and loot. It is just too... random. It's hard to find something appealing for your character - you will always have that redundant parameter you want to replace. And may be it's not a problem for those who play a lot, but for 10-15 hours of play it may be an issue  - They removed one of the best things I liked in the first game - the D&D-like saving throws. Instead there are these magic/physical armor concepts which just looks too... simplified and makes many magic abilities weak. Especially if the damage-dealers are physical-type (rangers, fighters)  Overall - I would recommend you this game. It is worth the full price. It has it's flaws, but it follows the best canons of an RPG-type game and it won't leave you disappointed. If you're not so much into customisation and aren't obsessed with the perfection of how your avatar looks - then the visuals of this game is one of the best you can find in the genre. If you're fine with simplification of the effects/counter-effects part of the combat - you'll like the new armor system. But in any case - if you like RPG - you'll like this game"

Regina,89,1,0,February 26,Recommended,192.6,"It's been a very, very long time since a game enthralled me like Divinity: Original Sin 2 has. I love a good RPG but they tend to feel like more of the same after you've played enough of them. Not Divinity, though. I found myself unable to turn away right from the get-go, wanting to turn over every single stone, search every crevice before moving on - and I'm sure there's still plenty of secrets I missed. I had over 12 hours logged before I'd even escaped the fortress for the first time.  The gameplay is engaging, the story compelling, the music enchanting, and the world a true work of beauty. I haven't felt this way about a game since I picked up Dungeon Siege off a Walmart shelf back in the early 00's."

"""\(o.o)/""",46,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,167.4,"Honestly, probably the best game I've ever played. Here's why:  -The graphics and spell animations are amazing and hairrising!  -Epic storyline.  -The fights are satisfying as hell, and you play by your own rules, and your techniques. Whether that being to just stand face to face to the enemy, or hide behind walls and place traps to checkmate.   -You can fail quests in this game, but it won't make you lose or have to redo everything.  -You choose your style of playing, you can be the kindhearted hero who helps everyone and doesn't harm a fly. Or you could kill every single person you can find, you can still proceed in the story, although they may have different outcomes.  -There's a way around everything, stuck somewhere? For example [SPOILER ALERT]  If you kill Migo, his daughter won't give you any keys, but you could always steal the keys or kill her, and other than that, there are atleast 1 more way inside.  -The way the elements work is logical and epic, throw a water baloon at someone, then cast a cold spell, poof, they're ice (unless they have resistances)  -You don't need to know a single thing about the first game, in fact, I never even knew about divinity: original sin before this came out, nor have I cared to play it, and I'm totally fine.   -Doing kind acts that won't seem to give you anything in return (such as giving free gold to a random npc), are most likely to give you something in return in the long run. Such as discounts for what they're selling.  -Choosing your skills and talents can make your story go in a different direction. I mean, there's a talent for speaking to animals...who don't wanna talk to their pets??? And sometimes they also have important information  :)  -I could go on but I'm lazy and I wanna play now...so..ye...xD  (This is the first review I've ever done, and I've owned steam for MANY years, that should say something about the game)"

Jestertitan,37,1,0,May 11,Recommended,396.6,"I have been a Steam member for, oh I'd say 15+ years, and have never cared enough to write a review.  I am so passionate about this game that I felt inspired enough to write my thoughts.  You can get the highlights from other reviews, but I just want to share my feelings because I'm very meticulous when I buy a new game and I read all these reviews.  I have over 350 hours into this game so far, and I'm still on my FIRST PLAYTHROUGH!  Now, this is due to my playstyle.  If you wanted to blast through the game I'd imagine I could in 50 hours or so, but I like to get all I can out of a game, and boy does this game have a lot.  Between the music, phenomenal gameplay, graphics (mine are low though because my computer sucks), and mostly the story.  What a great story.  Up there and maybe even better than witcher 3.  I put 700+ hours into skyrim and I can see myself playing through this game another few times to top that, and I haven't even gotten into the multiplayer yet.  If you like RPGs and turn-based games, or story-rich games, then this is for you.  There are so many variations you can play through between all the different builds, skills, spells, potions, crafting, etc.  This game is right now my favorite of all time, or at the very least top 5 all time of any game type, and I consider myself a moderately hardcore gamer with decades of experience gaming.  You will not regret this purchase.  People say there are bugs but I personally have not experienced any.  Most of the time people complaining about bugs is them just missing something, be it a hidden door, or stat effect that they don't know changes something.  I haven't experienced a single bug, maybe because I bought the game late after fixes.  Either way, buy this.  You won't regret it."

WamBamShookeran,72,1,0,August 22,Recommended,106.7,"This is a great game with some nearly game-breaking flaws. There were a decent amount of bugs in my playthrough. The combat is mind-numbingly slow. The stories are just okay IMO, maybe that's because there are so many stories going on that it can be hard to fully get into one, maybe it's just a ""me"" problem. I was tempted to go back and playthrough again, but I'm not very interested at this point, hopefully in the future I will be ready for round two. My playthrough was somewhat completionist (in that I completed every quest I came acrossed), and apparently took a hundred hours. That is a pretty long game! While the play time was long, the story itself felt somewhat short, or stilted. Perhaps it's because there are not that many regions/maps to play, perhaps it was because the slow combat effected the rest of the game so much. I really enjoyed the creative level design and the ability to go about things in a variety of ways, with only one playthrough under my belt I'm sure that I missed a lot of these extra details. There is no throwaway function in the game, which was a breath of fresh air. I expected spirit vision to be a one-and-done or very limited use mechanic but it comes into play all the time.   If they would fix the pace of the combat this game could be vastly improved, hopefully either the developer or modders will come up with a solution. I'd recommend waiting to buy it on sale, especially since the game will probably be in a better condition at that point anyways."

mypony89,35,1,0,"September 21, 2017",Recommended,30.1,"EDIT: Giving this a thumbs up now, not because larian changed anything, though they have fixed a couple of bugs, but because of the mods coming out for it. Larian laid the foundation and gave a great game but the modding community makes it better.    Good game,.   In my opinion the armor system makes the game tedius.  I don't believe it was well thought out.   The way armor works is that each mob has physical armor and magical armor, then they have their health.  No crowd control that deals with physical attributes will work on a mob unless the physical armor is 0.  The same goes for magical armor and crowd control for magical attributes.  Armor also keeps mobs from being hurt, so as long as they have any armor on they won't recieve damage.   For physical armor you destroy it by beating them with weapons and a select number of spells, (remember the effect of those spells won't do anything through) and to destroy magical armor you have to hit it with spells in order for magical effects or damage to be felt.  Once the armor is destroyed you can then damage their health and inflict status effects.  This may sound great but in the end it leads to tedius battles.  Wade in, hit the mob with swords as that is the easiest way to destroy the armor, then crowd control.  There is NO chance a status effect won't work once armor is gone.  The person or NPC is pretty much dead after that.    For me this just ruins the fun of what I have come to love and enjoy about D;OS, being able to expirement with different spells and effects to see how I can control the battlefield, (or be controlled.)  This also means that traps do almost nothing.  I just walk through them because they don't hurt.  Poison, who cares.  Electic field, ok, fire, sounds lovely to stroll through, as long as my armor is ok.  Outside of combat its easy to keep your armor up.  Everything else about the game is fine.  As for me though, I think I'm going to have to wait till a mod comes out that fixes the issues I've talked about which makes me sad since I spent over $150 in order to download and buy the game.  ($44 for game, $60 for data and another $60 when I need more data since I was having to use a tethered phone.)"

However, that went‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•up when I made 1 or 2 tiny different choices and ended up getting completely new missions and encounters, it was as if I was playing an ENTIRELY new game!

Controls: Although overwhelming at first, the controls become natural relatively quickly and can be utilised as you see fit, I have run into no inconveniences so far.

HantalGazi,167,1,0,June 26,Recommended,5.5,I've already finished this game on a pirated copy and I loved it so much that I had to buy it from Steam. I'm so planing on playing this game again with different playstyles. It has a great story and gameplay. Voice acting is top notch as well
null,89,1,0,March 27,Recommended,84.9,"Even better than the previous ones. Never ending quests, there's always something new to explore. GOTY indeed, 10/10."
Hotshot,99,1,0,June 29,Recommended,177.3,"Narrative: DOS 2 has a true fantasy story. It is one steeped in mystery and pushes the boundaries of creativity.  Each character has a unique subplot completely entangled with the main story. The side quests tie in with the games central themes and main narrative very well. Accordingly, they dont seem out of place or tacked on but are very believeable in the world crafted by larian studios. Music: The music works. It sets the tone quite nicely for the various parts of the world. It goes from epic to playful to somber to tragic in parallel with the envirement or scenario. Gameplay: The gameplay is very strategic with nuanced application. You must defeat intelligent and powerful Antagonists. Your set of abilities can be used envirementaly and you must keep your wits about you for the entirety of the game for both battle and exploration.  Characters: the ensemble cast of main characters each have their own ambitions, dreams, and philosophy. They are not just along for the ride. If you dont want to play as one of them you can create a character whose complexity and depth extends as far as yourself. Most if not all of the NPCs have believable ambitions and reasons for either deterring you or assisting you. there are many factions of npcs and 2/3 of them will seek your destruction depending on your choice so replayability is permitted. I have finished this game once and this is a reflection of that experience.  Since this is truly a great game, I wish everyone to play through and experience its wonders, for that is why I recommend the exploration mode for anyone that is turned off by the difficulty, so they can focus on exploration. I say that because the world and its characters are a spectacle to behold. This is the purest Role Playing Game i have played and I look forward to the future of its developer, Larian Studios."

This game is pretty slow paced - you will want to pay attention to the lore, to the stats on your charecters/weapons, the excellent dialogue between charecters, the methodological turn-based combat and many other fine details if you are going to make the most of playing it.  I don't usually like these things in a video game, but this game is so carefully and lovingly crafted that I have found myself irresistibly drawn into it."

Pawnda,262,1,0,February 21,Recommended,420.7,"Although this game is confusing at the very first time I played, especially about questing-story related and class management--this game is big great. This game has unique element of job you play, you will be given a full control of your character you want to be--I mean, you can really mix between one type of class and another to suit your playstyle. The RPG is good, combined with RTS battling system. The story is tailored by how you play it, you can skip the whole part when you want it to be skipped, but note that I don't recommended this whole story skipping thing because you will miss a lot of quest to makes your character strong.  Pros: - Narrator things at conversation like I were reading a book, I like it because I'm a writer, so this one suit me; - The graphics is decent, but not that spectacular, I give it 7/10; - You can talk to every individual, some gives you quest, some gives you lead to something. And every individual you can barter with; - Co-op (multiplayer or split-screen); - Character development, progression and decision making is three things important; - Has hidden things everywhere, puzzles are that makes it a big plus; - Clever AI and challenging environment to fight in; - The linear story is somehow amazing to me, plus there are total six different origin characters that has different story, and at top of that you can create your own character - Worth hours of gameplay (in different playthrough).  Cons: - The conversation system is just not my type; - Lacks of tips and tutorial as this game showed only for previous Divinity players; - Journal seems to be confusing because the finished quest or something like that doesn't moved to Archieved side automatically, and sometimes bugged and can't be done although it's actually done; - It's not friendly for a new player of Divinity series as showed above--lacks of tips and tutorial. You will only see a few of this along the games, and it seems not very helping either; - Some feature you couldn't understand after a few hours of gameplay; - Few minor bug (some related to story that makes it gamebreaking bug, but fortunately there are other way to approach).  9.5/10 hope I played this game earlier xD  EDIT ---  Definitive edition has some major improvement. But yes, no game is perfect.  Pros: + Beast's story is improved a little bit; + Arx got a lotta change; + Sir Lora; + Journal; + Some elements got nerfed and buffed.  Cons: - Changelog says that Retribution should be attractive to enemies, and I don't see the difference. - Bugged quests (as far, I got only two bug, one at the bloodmoon island called ""Shackles by Pain"" or something that we have to fight possesed dwarf. Two at Lohse quest called ""Crippled the Demon, I can't snuff out the candles and the dialog just give me ""turn away"" choice at the first candle. Update: I can snuff out the first candle by using tornado skill, weird, and the second candles snuffed without any problems, the third/ thousand candles are also without problem.)."

Lain,147,1,0,"October 29, 2017",Recommended,317.0,"REVIEW UPDATED AFTER GAME COMPLETION -----------------  +Same excellent, engaging combat system as the first game. Some expanded functionality +Some quality of life UI changes which make everything better +Better skills / attributes system which makes character creation more flexible +VO in the initial release (as opposed to being added in EE of D:OS) +2 player co-op was fun; 4 player co-op is awesome +When I first reviewed this game I said the story was ""marginal at best"" part way through Act 2. I've since changed my view on this; the characters develop very nicely through the rest of the game, and all of the plotlines of the individual characters tie up really nicely by the end. There were lots of things in the game that really made me say ""Wow. These developers really poured their blood and tears into this."" However....  -I do feel the game was a bit too long. 160 hours for one playthrough was tedious, and I put the playthrough on pause for a few months and came back to it. I think they could have done without Act 3 entirely, and done a second mega act in Act 4. The playtime also would be significantly mitigated by the below mentioned quality of life changes. -Simple things like: please don't allow lucky charm to roll on equipment. It's super annoying to switch gear / drink alcohol everytime I want to look something. -Still an inventory management simulator. Developers should really break out crafting ingredients into its own menu / sorting system. I spent a lot of time crafting scrolls, potions, and grenades as combat contingencies for Honour and this would have made a big difference in my gameplay experience. -Skillbook description poorly communicates spell range, making it hard to figure out the best skills for a build -Huge minus: crafting system is incomplete. Why can i only craft chest pieces, and not gloves / legs / helmets? Why are so many recipes that were in the first game missing from this one? -Huge minus: buggy as hell. Should have stayed in Early Access longer to fix these.  I originally reviewed this game as 7.5 / 10. I'm going to go with 8.5 / 10 with my revised view of the story / characters. With QOL changes and a tighter playtime, the next instance of this franchise could easily be a 9.5+ masterpiece. I'm very excited and will definitely be contributing to a kickstarter if there is one."

This is essentially D&D in video-game form.  Do whatever the hell you want to do. If you can think of it, there's probably an option.  If you enjoy fantastic writing and a grand over-arching story, genuinely compelling characters, a complex and terribly fun combat system, as well as a great balance of seriousness and humour, pick this goddamn game up immediately.

Big Daddy BeefDick,82,1,0,March 2,Recommended,263.6,"Fantastic Game if you're into RPGs. They took Divinity Original Sin and made it better it most aspects. The game is engaging all the way through and provides hours upon hours of game play with different ways of getting things done. The new restructure of Stats and Abilities makes you feel alot more in line with where you should be compared to other creatures of your level without feeling broken.   They simplified the way a lot of things work and the only one that irked me was Crafting. Crafting in Divinity Original Sin and Enhanced Edition really brought a lot to the game with money making and being able to stack resistances to make up for lower end gear that you just couldn't find an Upgrade for. In Divinity Sin Original Sin 2 you can forget about that and weapon enchants are down to just Two methods. Poison Barrel or an Eternal Object for Lightning. Poison Barrel adds Poison damage which honestly hurts for a ton of fights where you're partially healing the creature you're damaging(Undead).  The Dev Team is great, even after being released as a full game for this long they are still pumping out Bug Fix Patches and Game Balance Patches which shows they care about the Game and what the Community thinks.  I'd give this game an 8/10, Larian Studios really knows what they're doing."
Seppy,89,1,0,March 2,Recommended,56.4,"Total: 9.8/10  Here's my review    Customization/Progress 9.8 Customize things like: Appearance, Attributes, Abilites, Skills, Talents, Tags and your battle music whenever you kill an enemy. Every small upgrade you choose makes a big difference. Its a little poor when it comes to the face/hair customization but the other things makes up for it    Gameplay 9.8 Gameplay is smooth and feels immersive. Especially the dialogues and the impact it can have in most cases. The turn-based action gives you alot of time to think for the right moves and it's a game where you can relax and not just button mash your way through like Diablo. The ability to play with your friend(s) through the game is also very enticing. The reason I took away 0.2 of the score is because it can be quite confusing for newbies to find out what to do (especially if you haven't played Divinity 1 before)    Graphics 9.9 Suprisingly good graphics even up-close, but the ""Deathfog"" is annoying to watch while the camera is moving which is why I took away 0.1 score. Fortunately you won't see too much of it   Optimization 10 Very good optimization, with ""High"" settings I don't even notice frame drops in fights with alot of things going on.

Mirzqu,862,1,0,"December 6, 2017",Recommended,90.0,"Though I am not a huge fan of rpgs in general, this game just sucked me in. This game can surprise you in so many ways that you never imagined, be it someone yelling ''Show me your boobs!'' or discovering that you can apply nails to your boots. At first I thought this was just another ''hooray it's good'' but sucks game but actually it's one of my favourite games now that it really started rolling. All I want to play now is DOS2. Playing Co-op is even more fun, be it trolling your friends or goofing up stuff by accident.  Definetely worthy of purchase for anyone who's interested in rpgs. Turn based combat gives the game a nice tactical layer and makes you think your moves, really nice flavor for the game. Be it comboing your spells and elements or backstabbing and stealing stuff from people. The fact that quests aren't handheld and really shown you on the map and told you exactly what to do in questlog keeps you interested in conversations and game overall."

Anyway, the game is a typical Larian Studios game. They put a lot of effort in every little detail, even if you wont see half of them in one playthrough. The possibilities of problemsolving to almost everything are huge. And of course its played best with some friends who each have their own main character and own questlines.  This adds a lot to the replay value, not only that all of the six ""origin"" characters have their own unique quest, everyone does their own adventuring if you reach new places and get quest for the group find secrets or loot for himself"

Fayt,148,1,0,"December 19, 2016",Recommended,164.9,"Updating my review yet again as early acess and patches come thru. This will be edit number 4 after completing the first set once again.   Many of my initial complaints have been addressed at this point. Dialogue is much improved and even good enough to make the sub characters feel like real characters. They each had small story points in the opening that made it feel like they were actually progressing a bit more with you on your journey compared to attack bots you used in battle. They are still not fully fleshed out but it is early access.  Items/Gear/Spells are WAAAAYYYY better this time around. I was not spending the entire time struggling to find gear to use and feeling forced to have barter and thievery maxed just to try to keep my characters functioning. I did have trouble finding decent weapons for my 2hnd Knight while I got more crossbows than I knew what to do with but some RNG is expected. I felt the early parts of the game were also improved to not feel so brutal to get your first couple levels. I had only a few glitches or bugs along the way as well. (Ben Encourage refused to hit 2 out of my 4 party members for example and Electric discharge seemed to jump way off screen instead of to another enemy), but over all completely functional with lots of different ways to approach things or if you are like me do them all.   I did still have a few complaints that still are around. For one the combat does feel really one sided. Hit armor then CC lock and win. This strat worked on every fight but the last which it still worked just wasn't 100% one sided. The single time I died on the playthrough was the opposite happened to me. I didn't even use a single turn on my side just got to watch the enemy with infinite turns CC lock kill me till party wipe. So I didn't get a lot out of the gameplay combat itself.   This is still exasperated by the fact you can only customize your starting character. You are allowed to choose your other characters jobs when they first join, but you can't tweak or customize anything so the 3 party members I grabbed had some useless traits no matter what I choose I ended up just trying to pick the least painful loss among them. So It took till around level 4-5 till I felt like I had a team I really did enjoy using with the skills and traits I wanted.   Overall it was still a lot of fun this time around. I was expecting this to be a bit more painful at first every once in a while comming back to this game to see how it progressing while knowing we have no clue about release date. However, I enjoyed this playthru enough to finish and be reminded why I wanted to support the early access in the first place.   P.S. If Larian is reading this Please Please PLEASE add a main story Dwarf! I do feel a little left out while the premade characters have unique story situations, but I can't get them on a dwarf!"

Sargonist,51,1,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,62.8,"Very VERY Good game. Exciting, Story Driven, great customization.. The only thing id say about it, and its NOT a negative, is its VERY HARD. If you create a HERO, and DON'T build him/her correctly & a good mix of party members, you MIGHT find yourself stuck, dying every direction you choose to go the first few hours. In fact you might have to start over a few times. Choices MATTER so MUCH, Saying the WRONG thing to the WRONG person can spell disater VERY quickly. Tread conversations with Most anyone very CAREFULLY. I reccomend researching the kind of build you want and forming a very good party to mix them in with. The Voice acting is INSANE, EVERYONE has a voice, and conversations rarely follow the same route with each different party member.  I only have 10+ hours in this game, but i can tell the REplay value is  going to be great. Another thing, is multiplayer seems to need a little ironing out.. So if youre buying this for Solo, GO FOR IT.. Multiplayer? UNLESS you have  FOR SURE Friend(s) to play with, id hold off on Multiplayer with RANDOMS for now.

Still, it sits installed on my PC for 3 weeks and I hadn't touched it at all outside of just looking at character creation for 5 minutes and then turning it off...  Then... Yesterday afternoon, I start it up for real and play for an hour solo - I message my best friend and tell him it seems fun and maybe we could play multiplayer together. THIRTEEN HOURS LATER its 2am and I'm logging off only because I have to go to work at 7am.  We had SO much fun with this game. The breadth and depth of roleplay options, the robust combat systems, the meaningful character development through leveling and quests...  Superb game. Definitely would recommend. Cannot wait to play more."

Super Elephant,107,1,1,July 5,Recommended,140.0,"D:OS 2 is a thrilling and beautful adventure across the fictional land of Rivellon in search of becoming the next divine. The combat is deep and unique, and especially more fun on the higher difficulties where more strategy is involved. The voice acting is spectacular, particularly with the main cast of pre-generated characters.   However, where the game falls flat is its lack of originality in the main storyline. Esentially it brings upon the typical ""hey theres a bad guy and hes bad and powerful and we gotta be more powerful to defeat him"", with a few extra bits thrown in there. It continues like this until the later acts where it picks up. Thankfully, there are individual character stories that take place between for those before mentioned pre-generated characters, if you happen to have any in your party.  Overall, being a $45 title with easily 65+ hours content on just your first play through alone, this game is easily worth the price. And even being, there is an upcoming ""enhanced edition"" which is said to improve on the main story. I cannot recommend this game enough, despite its downfalls in the story and is easily in my top 3 games of all time."

Bittereinder,149,1,0,March 13,Recommended,96.2,"2017 was a good year for gaming, and Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the reasons for that. This RPG features top-down turn-based combat that is reminiscent of Temple of Elemental Evil, except that the encounter design here is much more varied and imaginative. The game actively encourages you to find creative solutions, sometimes things that would be considered 'cheesing' in other games, and rewards you for doing so. I found myself purposely trying to provoke fights sometimes, as they were just so much fun.   Compared to the first game, the writing is much better and more entertaining, and most of your potential companions are likeable and interesting - the resolution of Lohse's personal quest was genuinely moving. The animations, sound design and voice acting are top-notch across the board.  The main story didn't grip me quite as much, but it served its purpose of moving things along.   Of course, no game is perfect, and D:OS 2 is no exception. The loot level-scales to such an extent that a legendary axe at level 14 is worse than a regular grey axe at level 16. It means you won't experience the joy of finding a particularly good piece of equipment that will last you half the game, which is part of what made the old Infinity Engine games so fun. It also means it's a good idea to visit a vendor every time you level up, or you quickly risk falling behind. All that time spent shopping can get tedious.  I also have some issues with the way Source is handled in this game. Replenishing your Source is a very time-consuming process, so I found myself almost never using Source spells in combat.  This ties in with my assessment of the final fight, which is very hard and where you almost need to use Source (which you suddenly have limitless access to) to win - except that I had never really had a chance to experiment with that mechanic up to that point. I eventually managed to beat it, mostly through sheer luck, but it does not make for a very satisfying resolution to an otherwise great game.   All in all, despite the aforementioned flaws, Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a huge improvement over the first game, which was already quite good. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who is even the slightest bit interested in RPGs."

Game will really challenge you, even on normal...so it's not for crybabies. But it is a very gratifying, rich experience with plenty of humour, plots&twists and of course - awesome combat.

Jule Damn,37,1,0,March 2,Recommended,44.3,"I played part the Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition and enjoyed that, so I decided to get DOS 2 after I saw it on sale for a modest 10% (also because my friends had the game and I wanted to play with them).   As it turns out, this game is such an improvement on the first game that I just cant go back to DOSEE. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an amazing game that quite literally builds on every positive element of the Enhanced Edition and makes the game so much smoother and comprehensive.   YOU CAN NOW ACCESS ALL INVENTORIES OF YOUR PARTY MEMBERS IN ONE WINDOW. PRAISE LARIAN STUDIOS. Improvements were also made to many mechanics such as: Crafting, purchasing/bartering, targeting AOE spells.  The storyline is also so much more rich now that you have 5 preset characters to choose from (and the option to create your own). Right off the bat, I was much more engaged in DOS2's story than I ever was in the EE. I love their banter. I love that ALL party members can engage in dialogue, thus giving you multiple opportunities to get the ""right"" answers without needing to reload the game. The voice acting is great and the characters have personalities true to their plights.   If you enjoy story-rich games, this one's for you! (If the turn-based combat system deters you, there is the option to play the game in Explorer Mode to make the combat easier and thus a secondary feature).  TL;DR: This game is lots of fun! Kudos to a development team that listens to its community in order to improve on previous iterations of its game(s)!"

Ark,353,1,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,133.8,"Words cannot fully describe how wonderful the game is. After 106 hours I have finally finished it on tactician difficulty - the second highest out of 4 difficulty levels - and it's been one hell of a ride. In the pool of games that have filled the cRPG genre over time some are remembered for the gems that they are. This game truly deserves a place among those stars.    Short and quick: The best aspects The combat offers a huge variety of possibilites. 200+ spells allow you to build your character exactly to your liking. They aren't all magical, they don't all scale with intelligence like you'd expect from classical RPGs meaning you can mix a lot of combinations on your character. Don't think of spells as a 'magician only' thing. Every character will use a wide variety and it feels amazing to have this much choice in battle.  The AI will use insane combinations and synergies of spells just as much as you do. They will sacrifice their own if it gives them an advantage, they will use the environment against you.   No ridiculous RNG: Although dicerolls aren't completely banished out of the game these mechanics never feel unfair like in some other RPGs. Games based on pen & paper tend to use a lot of dicerolls but here you'll find that most mechanics have been modified to be very clear about how they work without relying on RNG. Doesn't mean critical attacks aren't possible if you want to play that way ;-)  There are no classes. Don't get mistaken by the character creation, it's only meant to be a help for the early game. You level and can spent your points on the different schools of sorcery. You're never restricted because of a 'class' and after leaving the first area you can fully respecc at any time. You can truly built your character the way you want to.  The worldbuilding is amazing. There is so much to explore, so many NPCs to talk to and stories to experience.  The characters - from simple animals to essential NPCs - are just as amazingly written as the world. Some you'll love, some you'll laugh about, some you'll hate, but never will you think they are acting out of character.   The choice is always yours. One moment you're a saint, next moment you decide an NPC isn't worth keeping alive. Although sometimes limited, there are always consequences.   To further strengthen the last point: You can play the game anyway you want and never hit a roadblock in the story. Even if you murder every NPC you see you'll be able to finish the story.   Play the entire campaign with up to 4 players. 'nuff said  The voiceacting is phenomenal. Everything in this game is voiced, including the narrator. Not only that, but the variety in voices is so large you will rarely - if ever - notice two voices sounding alike. Every unimportant guard, every NPC without a name, every animal in the wild, every character - no matter how essential they are to the story - sounds different and they manage to bring the emotions their words carry to life.  The soundtrack manages to describe the atmosphere in a wonderful way.   Although the story is rather serious, the little sprinkles of humor every now and then shine brightly.  Short and quick: The worst aspects The companions sidequests are wonderful and they influence the main story quite a lot. But everywhere else they're a little pale as they rarely voice their oppinion on what you do during the rest of the journey.   This game can easily overwhelm you. If you're familiar with the cRPG gerne you'd expect this but everyone else be warned: This is not a game you finish in a couple of hours nor is it a linear game. Having a huge freedom means your questlog will burst at times.  The difficulty is real. Even on classic - the normal mode - you'll get your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•handed to you on a silver plater. I finished the game in 106 hours on tactician - one difficulty above classic - and my save game told me I was 'alive' for 80 hours. That means I had 26 hours of reloading because of party wipes or decisions that I regreted. I thoroughly enjoyed the difficulty but be warned: It's not to be taken lightly.   A slight negative about undeads: If you play one or have one in your party you can chose to hide your undeadness and the story will acknowledge this but the combat won't. I assume it's done for the sake of difficulty and interesting gameplay, but enemies will always know that you're an undead and chose tactics that work against undeads like e.g. hurting you with healing magic.  After all is said, it's still a cRPG. There's a lot to read, a lot of sidequests to do and a lot of possibilites in how you tailor the story around you. Don't go into this game with wrong expectations. It's huge. Having wrong expectations can easily ruin the experience for you.  You might wonder even with all the high praise you've heard about this game how it compares to the best of the cRPG genre. It's not simple to answer this as classics like Baldur's Gate can be hard to enjoy these days. Some of the most defining games of this genre came out in the late 90's to early 00's after all. Divinity: Original Sin 2 takes the things that made those classics wonderful and wraps them into a modern engine. It learned from all the mistakes that happened with the first 'Original Sin' game and improved greatly on them. So in summary, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. For me it's not only the RPG of the year, it's a strong contender for game of the year."

Try out a rogue/shapeshifter who dabbles in necromancy and pyromancy, the warrior/geomancer with a side dish of shapeshifting, or why not the summoner/necromancer with a touch of wind and water magic utility? The possibilities really are endless here, and in the best way possible.

Mringasa,116,1,0,January 15,Recommended,171.4,"What to say about this game that hasn't been said already. I am not the biggest turn-based RPG fan, but Divinity: Original Sin II was recommended to me by a friend, and I am extremely glad I purchased it. 100+ hours for a first full playthrough, and I'm already considering my next.  The game itself is hard. VERY hard for a casual or novice player. This is the first game I have not felt that saving frequently amounted to save scumming. The fights are disgustingly hard when you first start out, BUT once you get a feel for the combat system and learn how to work the mechanics in your favor, it balances out quite nicely. The mechanics themselves are fantastic, and had me feeling great when I conquered battles that felt unfair and unbalanced.  That being said, avoid this game like the plague if you have no patience and want a game you can steamroll from the start. You will die, a lot, if you are inexperienced.   The storyline itself will suck you in and swallow your soul. I enjoyed it from beginning to the last sequence. That last sequence... sucked. Horribly. The battle, the story, the NPCs, everything. It was terrible. I wish the game hadn't ended because I loved it so much, to end up with that was just disheartening. There is a lot of choice in the game, and it gets ful marks from me for that. You can do anything you want, how you want, and with whoever you want. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Except for that final part, but endings don't make or break a game for me. It's the journey that matters.  Scores:  Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 10/10 Story: 9.5/10 (Ending gets a 3/10) Music: 7/10 (It was okay, nothing spectacular)  I'd have to give the game an overall 9.8/10 though. Even with my distaste for the ending sequence, this game is superb and deserves both your hard earned money and all the praise you can heap on it."
Vortigern,69,1,0,March 26,Recommended,120.9,"I always feel very lazy about writing reviews but they deserve it, even if the review is a little bit too late.   A title? A MASTERPIECE. After 117 hours in this game I finally finished it on normal mode. I did my best to explore every corner and solve every puzzle, read every book, but I ended up missing a few things.  I gotta play it again on a higher difficulty with other characters, specially with Loshe on the team.   Well, let's get to it. First of all you need to know if this game is for you. Do you like turn-based RPGs? Do you like reading the books that you find, caring about little details of the world and developing your characters regarding the lore? Do you like spending time outside the combat and just strolling around the city and getting to know its inhabbitants and its atmosphere? Then this game is definetely for you.   Why did I ask that? Well, the combat is amazing but you won't be battling every time. A lot of situations can be solved through dialogue for instance. That are a lot of other elements in the game like talking, exploration and puzzles. So you need to beware of that.  The story starts slow and you have a feeling that you won't care for it at all. But you need to see how things develop. It has ups and downs and a complexity that I can't explain to you without spoiling it. I loved it. You will care for most characters and even sidekicks, damn, it is that good. There are a lot of humor and jokes in the game, like talking to silly or arrogant animals or facing ironical situations. It doesn't diminish the experience or transform it into a goofish playthrough. No. It adds up, a lot. You feel that you are in a rich and complex world with characters that mess up, that are understandable badguys or that are just self righteous‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•    Regarding the combat system, it had a lot of improvments in comparison to the previous title. Fire, Water, Electricity, Poison, Oil, Clouds, Blood, High Ground (Yes, I have it, Anakin), Low Ground, Teleportation, Physical Armor, Magical Armor, Resistances, etc. are all things to take into account, contributing to enhance the complexity of the combat system. The enemies will try to use those elements against you and the AI is pretty decent most of the time.  However, I have to say that there are minor issues regarding battles. What annoys me the most? Fights with 5+ enemies that cast 2-3 spells each. Man, that can take a lot of your time. Dead time because you will just be watching them casting and casting. It can take forever. Also, it pisses me off when the enemy uses a spell that takes control you character - like ""charm"" for exemple. In those occasions the AI simply doesn't know what to do. It takes a longer time to calculate the action and will eventually drink all your potions for nothing, while you sit there waiting.   In addition to that there are some minor bugs regarding the quest log. And I feel that they could really improve the inventory system. It's better and Divinity Origial Sin 1,sure, but it can still get pretty messy, specially books. My suggestion? Make it like a library system in your headquarters. Then you could store them in a shelf to complete a specific collection, let's say alchemy recipes or Hewbert's Encyclopedia. Also, the crafting system could be better too. I know that they want it to be more based on intuition, but some times the player has no clue about the ingredients. Also, more meaningful crafted armors and weapons would be awesome.   Nevertheless, all of those are minor criticism to improve the game. It's absolutely gorgeous - visually and musically -, engaging and a true RPG experience. I feel that those AAA companies really have a lot to learn from Larian Studios. I liked Divinity Original Sin 1, but the sequel is absolutely amazing. Bravo!  "

Even though DOS:2 does not hold that same kind of magic, it has its own special moments while feeling like a modern game. The world has absorbed me, the characters have enraptured me and I think on an overall, this is one of the few games in which your choices actually matter.

Well done Larian Studios, this is how you make an RPG game. The big dev studios can learn a lot from you Larian Studios and they should, a smaller dev house from Belgium.

frozen north,40,1,0,"December 8, 2017",Recommended,113.4,"Holy crap. This game is amazing.  So heres the run down. This game is in effect a massive game of dungeons and dragons, only the game is the dungeon master rather then your friend being the dungeon master.   The RPG aspects all feel really nicely done here, with concious effort being required to decide on how best to talk your way through a situation. The fact that every character in the game comes with voice acting is simply astounding, esspecially given just how many characters there are in this game.  As far as combat is concerned, its very similar to XCOM and atlas reactor. Each character recieves a turn, with the order being determind by each characters initiave stat. Much like XCOM and atlas reactor, every action has to have its strength and weaknesses weighted against the situation. To be completely honest, the combat system feels so smooth and effective, it makes the non-combat sections feel underwhelming as a result, and believe me, they definetly are not boring.  The multiplayer aspects are really nice. Personally, I recommend only playing multiplayer with friends, but that has more to do with ensuring cooperation then anything else. One nice feature of playing with friends is that it makes every moment feel more enjoyable.  All that said, I do have a few nitpicks about this game. The ingame market system can feel annoying at times, since only one person can foot the bill for an order of gear. Similarly, there will be many occasions where you can find yourself running through the same dialog again and again in hopes of achieving the best result.  However, despite everything else I have said, the single best thing about this game is its customizability. Built into the game is an editor that allows you to alter the map, the story, and where all enemies are located, which gives the game huge replay value. On top of that, the game is perfectly capable of accepting mods, which cranks this games replay value up to eleven.  Summary: Pros: + Absolutely amazing combat system that feels very familiar to anyone who has played XCOM. + Amazing graphics quality. + Insanely rich story and lore. + Dozens of hours per campaign. + Tons of replay value. + All voice acting is well done, and if you can talk to it, it has a voice. + Loot has a heavy ammount of RNG attached to it. + Everything is right there after you download the game (an increasingly rare thing these days). + Your starting class is completely flexible, and you can change just about everything about your starting class. + You do not need to stick to a specific class as the game goes on, allowing you to adapt as you go. + A ton of workshop content, and the games less then four months old.  Cons: - Things can get a little tedious at times, particularly if your not the best at keeping your saves up to date. - Purchasing from vendors is a little annoying, and I personally feel it could stand some more quality of life features. - You may find yourself restarting fights often as you realize what actually is happening.  Conclusions: Divinity original sin 2 is simply an amazing game. Almost everything about this game screams of quality, and feels like it is the result of honest game design. When people say this is a top of the line RPG game, they are not kidding. With extreme ease of modding, and a still growing community, its easy to see why this game is being called game of the year material.  Score: 9.9/10"

abel1717,82,1,0,March 26,Recommended,147.2,"""Original Sin 2"" is an excellent game with a horrible balance of forces.  It has all the elements to be a rewarding game with satisfying game playability (i.e., you can play it in so many different ways you never get bored). However, when fighting multiple foes it gets disturbing that the player must wait ages until every one of them took a shot at your character. I think it must be better if not all the enemy players attack in a single turn."

JOOHN CENAA,42,1,0,May 17,Recommended,128.8,"Great game overall.  Pros: + Complex, detailed and engaging story in an immersive fictional world + Finished the game with ~130 hours clocked from one playthrough, and I didn't complete all of the quests + High quality of voice acting throughout, dialogue options vary between characters + Combat system incredibly versatile with a huge range of possibilites and combinations + Skills and equipment can allow a high level of specialisation for certain characters, with a huge variety of abilities + Similarly, the levelling up system allows for lots of modifications, and later in the game it is possible to re-spec characters if you made poor choices early on + A high level of customatisation, good voice acting, and in depth character backstories all lends the characters credibility in a way that can make you love or hate them + Extremely varied quest lines, often there are multiple ways to solve each quest + Really laugh-out-loud funny at times  Cons: - Steep learning curve on the combat, very much thrown in at the deep end with little explanation of complex system  - The combat is actually pretty hard throughout, and more casual gamers might find the repeated loading frustrating, as a small slip up in combat can be pretty unforgiving - Similarly, the game has a bad habit of insta-killing you with no real way of predicting it (e.g. suddenly encountering over-levelled enemies, environmental hazards, or the enemy has some ability/skill that you had no way of countering until now) - Quests can sometimes be tortuous in a way that means I would never have worked out on my own e.g. a riddle once asked for fire, but this didn't work, and I found online that I had to generate a fire cloud instead (?!) which I had never come across before and could only reliably find by buying one particular spellbook from one particular unrelated vendor. I spent a lot of time looking up how I was supposed to do quests - Similarly, quests can have unexpected consequences that can be inconvenient later on and lead to missing out on future quests - As I said before, you may find yourself totally underlevelled in an unexpected battle, and this does somewhat detract from the whole open world RPG vibe in that you have no hope of defeating some of the higher levelled enemies and have to go find some lower level enemies first, effectively forcing you to follow a pre-set path eliminating the weak enemies first and then going back for the higher ones. It makes the game feel more linear, although it is satisfying to decimate the enemies who destroyed you a couple of levels ago   Overall the negative points don't massively detract from the game and it is a compelling and immersive game from start to finish with complex but satisfying combat. More importantly, you can talk to dogs!! "

I love this game."
Literal Potato,227,1,0,May 30,Recommended,87.1,"TL;DR: Extremely well designed RPG overall, Great visual/graphics, Engaging and well written story, deep, fun, and challenging gameplay, would totally recommend this game if you are a fan of the genre  Aesthetics (Graphics, Visuals, Music): Absolutely top notch- the amount of detail in this game is astounding on a visual level. From each character looking fantastic, to the detail in spells and animation, to the level of beauty in the environment, overall this game looks great. The only drawback to this is that it's more demanding, resource-wise, than similar games. The music is also phenomenal and really follows the mood of the story without being too intrusive.  Gameplay: the combat system in this game is pretty similar to other CRPGs, but goes above and beyond. My personal favorite touch is the amount with which the environment can contribute to combat scenarios. There is a small learning curve which basically makes it the Dark Souls of- just kidding. There is a weird issue with balance where being overleveled by just 1 or 2 levels makes some fights trivial while being underleveled by 1 or 2 levels makes some fights annoyingly difficult, but overall, the game seems to do a good job of leveling the playing field... unless you're like me and added a mod that doubles the amount of enemies. One thing that is really underappreciated is how civil abilities affect gameplay. Characters have to balance environment and gear interactions, stealth skills, luck, and persuasion/bartering all in one pool of points. This can lead to balanced jack of all trades (master of none) characters, or min-max characters. This game also allows a lot of freedom in how to play by deciding lone wolf or travelling with a full party and by allowing you to constantly respec yourself and your companions.  Story: Extremely deep and interesting. I have found myself underwelmed by  lot of RPG stories as of late, thut this game was definitely an exception. Each of the comanions/prebuilt characers have their own stories which are fairly interesting but the main story and most of the side quests are captivating. There seems to be just enough instruction that you have an idea what to do, but this game will definitely not hold your hand and tell you exatly where to go. You can get lost or have absolutely no idea where to go, but it doesn't take a lot to get you back on track. Decently replayable - story length can be 30-70 hours depending on how into the story and side quests you get.  Notes: I haven't tried the multiplayer or GM mode yet"
Imperius,72,1,0,May 30,Recommended,107.3,"Didnt know i could like a turn based game so much. Never played FF so this was a great first game to try in the genre. Basically a D&D campaign in video game form. My preference in games is that there is an rpg element and this one satisfied that need. Fun to play with friends albeit it very slow. Replay value is low if you play on the hardest difficulty first and some of the skills for solo make the game very easy. Still very fun, by on sale."
Autumn,113,1,0,May 30,Recommended,74.0,This is probably one of the greatest RPG ever made. Turn based combat with a huge variety of builds allows for very imaginative playthroughs combat-wise. And the infinite amount of decisions that you can make throughout the game adds for replayability only to see even more of the story. 10/10.

Funnychocobo13,49,1,0,June 26,Recommended,130.4,"I. Adore. This. Game.  This is one of the only RPGs I've played in recent history in which I rarely felt like I couldn't do or say exactly what I wanted in any given moment. Quests can be tranversed, subversed, or just flat-out ignored. There are multiple means to achieving your goals. In short, player freedom is abundant throughout. Pacing of the game is great at best, decent at worst. The Origin characters, and, thus, your companions, fit your pretty typical Fantasy archetypes (gruff lone wolf mercenary, snobby exiled prince, raunchy pirate dwarf), but they never feel too wholly unoriginal. In fact, by the end I grew to like my little cast of mildly predictable misfits. Their individual quests also provide some extra motivation to continue, helping along with the general pace of things. Combat is fun, clever, and rewarding to master. Few things feel as good as properly changing up the terrain with a few spells or broken barrels then using the newly doused ground to trail a lightning spell to your enemies. The combat balance in the game isn't always perfect, but it is good enough throughout most of it that the few unfairly difficult fights don't overshadow the challenging but fun ones. There's not much to say about the music in the game. It's magnificent, I love it, and I order the soundtrack on vinyl. So there. I haven't even dabbled in the Game Master mode or the various Workshop mods yet, but they look very promising and exciting. At the time of writing (June 2018), I have 128 hours or so played in the game. That was one playthrough and maybe 5 hours of my second. I am not at all concerned that this game was not worth the investment. On top of that, Larian (the developer) is still supporting the game, working hard on the Definitive Edition of the game due out later this year (free of charge for players who already own the game). They clearly love their game, and it's apparent through all the work they do. So not only would you be getting a great game, but you'd be supporting a wonderful studio in the process. But hey, I'm not your boss ^.^;;"

The character appearence customisation leaves something to be desired but you don't really see your characters face much anyway. I love that there is freedom to do whatever you want without it being sub-optimal, thanks to armor requirements being awesomely forgiving and skill scaling being on level or weapon. I managed to be the game on explorer mode and it is pretty easy, which would mean that the 3 more difficult modes would offer a good level of challenge to them. There's several party members with unique stories which are fun to unfold as well. Definitely worth the money and time spent."

Fred FredBurger,355,1,0,May 28,Recommended,48.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is OKAY at BEST. I wholeheartedly agree with some of the more critical reviews.  The first chapter of Fort Joy is the highlight of the game and after that it starts turning mediocre at times.  I tend to be a completionist. I was level 7 on all of my characters escaping Fort Joy and the game became tedious and boring to me in the swamp area.  At some point in the game you will realize that your choices really do not matter and that out of 4 dialogue options, you really only have 2 that are different. I cannot find myself to beat this game even after leaving the swamp area.  It sucks at times.  It's so boring watching the combat and the fights now are all the same crap. Even on normal difficulty the balance between easy fights and difficult feels off.  I shouldn't have left Fort Joy at level 7 (average is around level 5 i believe) but that's what the game allowed and I suffered for it. I don't feel divine. I don't feel powerful. I feel like I am doing chores running around and watching boring‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•fight scenes and I'm not alone.  To add to this if you just wanted to rush through the story you would be underleveled and then have an extremely difficult time all the time.  This game needs dynamic balancing badly.  My friends all bought this game and we don't play multiplayer anymore. I am the only one who got past 40 hours of playtime and I regret it. 5/7 would game again."

lowly barista [zani],300,1,0,June 5,Recommended,73.4,"Much bigger than the first game.  Combat evolved a lot.   I don't know if it's better or worse, it depends on how you feel about co-op or single player campaigns.   It nerfed a lot of interactions you could use in the first and it also added semi-permanent battle field states.  The plus side is that the story has so many branching points that it's difficult to say if you're playing storyline 1 2 or 3.  I wouldn't call it seamless but I'd say its far less jarring than playing KOTR or something similar.  I highly recommend playing thsi blind as well.

Roche,165,1,0,"December 3, 2017",Recommended,179.1,"A Must Buy RPG Summary:  This is the best classic-rpg I've ever played and most polished indie game. It's the first example, in a long time, of a game that made me feel like paying full price was more than worth it. My reasons and dislikes are bulleted as pros & cons. If you're hesitant, try learning about the franchise before playing. The world is interesting without prior knowledge of the Divinity franchise, but I still highly recommend you catch up on the lore. At the very least the first original sin game if not all of it. If not, make sure to read the store page and view the trailers before starting. Otherwise, your introduction into the franchise backstory (universe) will be journal entries and books. There is pvp in the game, but it's far from being a highlight. It's practically dead; you'd have more luck co-oping.  Rating: Solid 9/10 Pros:  - Rich Backstory - Multiple approaches to questlines - Best looking classic isometric rpg so far - Abundance and variety of skills and abilities - Well over 100 hours worth of good content - Your character can become any class combination in the game - Great co-op, able to compete with teamates or help each other - Good writing, mostly voice acted, solves a common weakness in the genre - Both side and main quests are engaging, laced with secrets and hidden areas  - Old school, sandbox-like, lack of handholding, more freedom as a result:    o The easy mode doesn't neccessarily simplify the game, just the combat  - High replayability in both custom and original chars:    o Race influences how you're percieved and affects dialogue and quest approach    o Multiple endings based on key decisions  - Decent modding community, solves several minor complaints (disables achivements):    o Visuals like clothing, hair, face model, more loot indicators etc.    o Progression (xp tweaks, starting gear)    o Abilities reworked for the better    o Buff effects, durations etc.    o User-made campaigns Cons:  - Companions don't say much - Few questline bugs, still rewards exp - The 4 acts in the game are great, but the last one is rushed - Combat favors heavy specialization in harder difficulties (all melee, all magic) - Crafting and inventory management is a pain, adds unnecessary time (no search function)"

So I will make this very simple: Stop reading and buy this game. Right now.  What, you're not going to listen to me? Still reading? A stubborn audience . . . I like that. Fine, let me attack you with some of the better reasons to immediately get this game.   -4 Player Co-op or Play solo with 4 characters to aid you!  -Rewarding and hilariously fun isometric-turn-based combat with a slew of fun mechanics. Think Baulder's Gate meets Xcom. You can make it rain followed by dropping lighting on everything thats wet, or set the enemy ablaze by dousing them with oil and chucking a bit of fire their way.   -A rich world full of mistakes to make and trouble to find. What? That sounds bad? That's like 90% OF 90% of all RPG titles! Seriously though talk to that crab, rob that old woman,‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•of that dragon. You can do it, I have total faith in you!  -A rewarding and hilariously fun choose-your-style combat. Make your own class! Want a Knight that shoots lighting? A greatsword wielding Mage? Go the heckens for it!  -A marvelous cast of characters. The Origins characters and the NPC's of the worlds are just great.  -An engaging and expansive story. Saying nothing, go play this game.   -Adorable Talking Animals. They are the best.   -Rewarding and hil- I think you get that point by now actually: It's fun to fight all the things!  -A GM mode so you can make your own D&D like story for your own vict- friends to play!

Jackrabbitofdoom,140,1,0,"December 3, 2017",Recommended,55.7,"It's a lot of fun even if you're new to RPGs in general.  Combat - Simple, VERY open system in which you can attack anybody at any time. (Good for setting up fights with neutral characters you don't like or friendly characters that have good loot.)   Dialogue/Story - The dynamic between the templar-esque people and the summoners is fun. Skills such as the one that makes you able to talk to animals serves as a way of having a unique experience that most people wouldn't pick. Though I have to say, some of the mid/later game story is pretty boring and I skipped through most of it.   Graphics - Game looks good as‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I really enjoy the elemental damage appearance. Ex. Pouring rain on an area then hitting it when lightning.   Control - It's mostly point and click for everything. There are some pretty nice things in the game though, like the ability to detach certain members from the main party.   Replayability - I have yet to play half of the classes and two of the races in the game.   Overall - 9/10. Besides the story that begins to drag a bit near the mid/end game, it's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s of fun."

Recommend playing with friends, a party of 4 with your friends is awesome. but the game is super fun playing alone as well.  + Beautiful aesthetics.  + Excellent sound design.  + a unquie and intresting system for combat effects (watch one of the videos explaining the spell casting system and you     will see for your self).  + Challenging Enter an area before you are ready and the journey can be a bit rough.

Khalamity of the Hums,96,1,0,"December 24, 2017",Recommended,116.8,I had a blast playing this with friends and it's one of the best multiplayer D&D-esque games on the market. There is a lot of content. You won't burn through this game's story in 20-30 hours like most rpg's.
EnthusiasticTaco,43,1,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,35.3,"This game starts very strong but has the common inconsistencies of RPG, Free dialogue style play. (Similar to Fallout, Elder scrolls). I have spent almost 40 hours in the game to date and have enjoyed it, however, I never feel this game draws you into the world. It doesn't deserve 9/10 ratings, it is 7/10 at best. There are some game breaking mechanics that weaken a class or particular set of abilities.  Teleport is overwhelmingly overpowered, it literally breaks every aspect of the game if you use it right. You can completely alter the desired mechanic of a fight by using it. (unfairly) For example, Whilst a boss, I teleported him to my party and immediately killed him alone, well before his allies could help him and then when a neutral add spawned, i teleported his party members to the neutral add to get cleaved and then had to just fight the neutral add.   For example, Having a mage/wizard doing damage in a party primarily built up of Physical dps (Enemies have two forms of Armour, Physical and Magical) is pointless.  Their value as damage dealers drops to zero, they will hardly break-through any magical armour alone.  ""Tank"" classes don't exist as taunt has too short of a range, and most times your enemies will be immune to taunt.  I enjoyed the game, but simple things like save files and fast travels legitamtely break any immersion. You can save game in the middle of a fight and alter it to achieve victory at certain points. In one quest chain, your party is separated intentionally for the purpose of the quest. However, you can just fast travel to the centre of the quest zone with each individual character, there-by eliminating any effort.  The good;  Voice acting is incredible, if you enjoy DnD, then you'll love this game. Classical mode seems like the perfect ""Normal"" - It is challenging/formidable if you brazenly walk into a room of enemies, but if you draw them through fire or into a choke point then it becomes an even playing field.  LoS is your friend.  Probably the best turn based strategy game i've played to date.  Sneak and Thievery is just plain OP, you can't go without it.  Being able to sneak and put explosive barrels around enemies is vital to success in many fights, especially against stronger mobs.    Buy the game and make an opinion yourself. I stopped enjoying it at close to 40 hours played. The story was boring and uninteresting and even at 40 hours (Which is half way through the game).  Still worth a pick up - but the game really comes down to personal taste, it doesn't appeal to me.  i would love to see more games with this classical mode difficulty, by far that was the most interesting aspect of the game."

CptRagebeard,104,1,0,April 20,Recommended,112.1,"This game is, by far, the best RPG game I have ever played in the history of all my 20 years of gaming. I cannot wait to put thousands of hours into it. The only issue I have with it, however, is how limited the character creation system is, but I guess no game can be absolutely perfect. That said, here's why I love this game and will enjoy playing it for likely years to come.  The story:  I've only ever gotten so far as ACT II, but even still, the story in that time is so rich it'd put the CEO of the Amazon corporation to shame. The openess of the story makes for excellent roleplay elements. It'll keep you hooked and wanting more and more the further you delve into it.  Gameplay:  The only class restrictions are literally how you choose to build your character because of where you choose to put your attribute and ability points. That sky's the limit, and any kind of character imaginable can be built and played in this game. I would even go so far as to say this game is the closest game to a D&D simulator there can be without actually being D&D.  Combat:  Generally, I'm not a fan of turn-based combat outside of games like CIV games, but the system for this game really takes the cake. While the combat is turned based, the way it's set up to function is absolutely marvelous. The great minds at Larian Studios definitely didn't go wrong with it--at all.  Customization:  This game is open to steam workshop elements and modding. It also has a Dungeon Master aspect that allows you to create and run custom campaigns for you and four of your friends. However, I recommend playing the game as the vanilla version before adding mods to it, as some of them can be quite game breaking. Trust me, though, you absolutely won't regret it.  All-in-all, this game is pretty much perfect minus my only aforementioned problem with character customization. Other than that, I would definitely recommend this game and have absolutely nothing but good things to say about it! I give this game a 9.9/10."

It might even surpass my love for fallout 1. In a few days, Divinity original sin 2, became my most played game on steam.  The main storyline is somewhat generic, but almost all of the side-quests are amazing, with most of them having multiple outcomes.  When i began, i wasn't sure how i felt about the pre-generated characters (even though you can make your own too) but having played through the game, both alone and with friends, i actually love it. it gives the game quite alot of replayability, because the game feels more chracters driven, than most CRPG's do.  The turn-based combat system feels amazing to me. I've read complaints about the armor system. But i like it, because you can't just stun-lock every enemy. You have to be more tactical than that. exspecially on the harder difficulties.  It has some bugs, but larian seems to be doing what they can to fix them.   overall the graphics might be a little outdated, but it has alot of charm, and some nice spell effects."

I'm in to RPGs like Skyrim, the Witcher, Dragon Age(ish), and fantasy stuff like that. I had always seen this game advertised on steam's front page in recommended for me, but i never took it seriously since it gave me a very ""Diablo 3"" kinda vibe, and that felt too grindy and un-fun for me. But eventually, I finally caved a decided to take a good look at it and felt i should try it out, since I've heard pretty much only good things (see entire review section of this game lmao). Basically, i didn't many expectations starting out.  Holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• This game is good. Like really good. Like REALLY, REALLY good. I did not expect to fall in love as much as I did, nor to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing binge the game and end up earning 80 hours played within a week. I believe a testament to this game's quality is how hard i fell for it, even without playing (or even really knowing about) the first Divinity. It's detailed, it's fun, it has a great story, the gameplay is engaging and does not get dull, and the sheer freedom the player has is incredible. The game's dialouge and overall feel gives me a big DnD vibe. There are many, many branches a dialouge, quests, and the story itself can break off into which will seriously affect how you go forward in the game, even affecting the ending in a very critical way, not the ""good"" or ""bad"" ending bs you normally get from choice-based gameplay like Dishonored or Mass Effect. Moreso, the games gives you more freedom in how you want to build your character, not confining people to class, but rather providing a ""skill level"" you must be leveled up to in order to learn certain abilities, which are all fairly low.  I don't have the ability like other people to give you a long review about every little thing, so I'll leave with this: If you are looking for a fantasy RPG that will reward you with a in-depth experience and let you truly craft your character to be exactly who YOU want them to be, then this is the game for you.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a calibur of game that belongs with the other incredible RPGs like Skyrim or The Witcher 3, and possibly has the potential to surpass them, in my opinion. 11/10 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing fantastic"

And like many RPGs, this game is very supportive of mods, which is something i would definitely recommend looking at if you wish to spice up the game [Note: Be aware that this will disable achievements]. The modding community is one of the best modding communities out there, opening up opportunities for new, crazy classes to choose from, increased enemy difficulty, more customisation options, different buffs and de-buffs for you, your allies and your enemies and so much more. what's more, every character has a voice, even your custom character! no more suffering from silent protangonist syndrome, your character all the freedom in the world to speak their opinions.   10/10 would recommend to anyone who like RPGs and is invested in a good story.

I was, unfortunately, born too late to see Baldur's Gate 2 in all its glory when it first released, and by the time I did play the game, it had already felt extremely dated, and even still held a certain magic to its world.  Even though DOS:2 does not hold that same kind of magic, it has its own special moments while feeling like a modern game. The world has absorbed me, the characters have enraptured me and I think on an overall, this is one of the few games in which your choices actually matter.  Plus the price isn't your traditonal 60$, while still feeling like a bigger game than most 60$ games these days.  So yeah, if you're into RPGs, wonderful worlds and fun characters... Buy it."

frozen north,40,1,0,"December 8, 2017",Recommended,113.4,"Holy crap. This game is amazing.  So heres the run down. This game is in effect a massive game of dungeons and dragons, only the game is the dungeon master rather then your friend being the dungeon master.   The RPG aspects all feel really nicely done here, with concious effort being required to decide on how best to talk your way through a situation. The fact that every character in the game comes with voice acting is simply astounding, esspecially given just how many characters there are in this game.  As far as combat is concerned, its very similar to XCOM and atlas reactor. Each character recieves a turn, with the order being determind by each characters initiave stat. Much like XCOM and atlas reactor, every action has to have its strength and weaknesses weighted against the situation. To be completely honest, the combat system feels so smooth and effective, it makes the non-combat sections feel underwhelming as a result, and believe me, they definetly are not boring.  The multiplayer aspects are really nice. Personally, I recommend only playing multiplayer with friends, but that has more to do with ensuring cooperation then anything else. One nice feature of playing with friends is that it makes every moment feel more enjoyable.  All that said, I do have a few nitpicks about this game. The ingame market system can feel annoying at times, since only one person can foot the bill for an order of gear. Similarly, there will be many occasions where you can find yourself running through the same dialog again and again in hopes of achieving the best result.  However, despite everything else I have said, the single best thing about this game is its customizability. Built into the game is an editor that allows you to alter the map, the story, and where all enemies are located, which gives the game huge replay value. On top of that, the game is perfectly capable of accepting mods, which cranks this games replay value up to eleven.  Summary: Pros: + Absolutely amazing combat system that feels very familiar to anyone who has played XCOM. + Amazing graphics quality. + Insanely rich story and lore. + Dozens of hours per campaign. + Tons of replay value. + All voice acting is well done, and if you can talk to it, it has a voice. + Loot has a heavy ammount of RNG attached to it. + Everything is right there after you download the game (an increasingly rare thing these days). + Your starting class is completely flexible, and you can change just about everything about your starting class. + You do not need to stick to a specific class as the game goes on, allowing you to adapt as you go. + A ton of workshop content, and the games less then four months old.  Cons: - Things can get a little tedious at times, particularly if your not the best at keeping your saves up to date. - Purchasing from vendors is a little annoying, and I personally feel it could stand some more quality of life features. - You may find yourself restarting fights often as you realize what actually is happening.  Conclusions: Divinity original sin 2 is simply an amazing game. Almost everything about this game screams of quality, and feels like it is the result of honest game design. When people say this is a top of the line RPG game, they are not kidding. With extreme ease of modding, and a still growing community, its easy to see why this game is being called game of the year material.  Score: 9.9/10"

abel1717,82,1,0,March 26,Recommended,147.2,"""Original Sin 2"" is an excellent game with a horrible balance of forces.  It has all the elements to be a rewarding game with satisfying game playability (i.e., you can play it in so many different ways you never get bored). However, when fighting multiple foes it gets disturbing that the player must wait ages until every one of them took a shot at your character. I think it must be better if not all the enemy players attack in a single turn."

It expands heavily on the tactical combat and player choice of the first game in ways that few to no other RPGs of it's kind has ever done. I'm several hours in and have only cleared the initial starting area and apparently there are still HOURS and HOURS of main quests, side quests and other diversions to go. The voice acting is great. The loot is great. The characters are in depth and amazing (even talking to animals you will find that they are highly unique and have diverse voice actors!). The replayability in this game is very high as well as you can always tackle quests and situations in NUMEROUS ways. This game is so far from linear it puts similar games to shame. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet but it would be fun to see how it compares to the first game."

With that said, a few points to make that may equally fall on the positive as landing on your con list. All of this is most true as long as you enter the game wanting to experience the story and invest in the characters. Otherwise I imagine some parts fall flat. Most of the systems (like crafting etc) aren't introduced and taught which could be frustrating with no limitation of what to pick up or not (bit of the Elder Scrolls syndrome)."
Mister Big Dragon Milk,185,1,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,44.9,"At the time of writing this review, I've put about 30ish hours into the game (I torrented the game at first, don't judge me), and honestly I love this game.  I'm a big fan of RPGs in general (check my hours on basically any of the Bethesda RPGs and The Witcher 2&3) as well as an avid D&D player.  This game to me feels like playing Dungeons and Dragons but focusing on all the delicious crunch of player creation, leveling, and building.  The system feels tight and well balanced as well as having a great variety of player options to choose from.  Players are not so much locked into a specific role or archetype in this game.  Your average tanky knight character isn't just a dude with a sword and a shield, more often than not he's dabbling in earth or water magic to shore up his own defenses, or perhaps it's a rogue dabbling in necromancy.  Your mage may be wearing full plate and running into the thick of things, firing off fireballs in all directions.  The point is, the game gives you a lot of options to build and grow your character.  I've yet to ""beat"" the game but I've enjoyed the crunch so much, I've made a good dozen or so characters just to try out different playstyles.  Most of the issues I've had with the core gameplay have been patched, (i.e certain boss monsters skipping my characters turn because they get a forced turn one even though my character had a higher initiative, spells and attack not registering while draining AP, and other misc. bugs and oversights).  The world of Divinity is also interesting.  Worldbuilding is something I like to do in my spare time and some of the ideas presented in this game are very very cool.  Lizards are former dragons and rulers of an empire built on the backs of slaves, elves are cannibals who gain knowledge from eating flesh, and dwarves are... well I guess they're standard fantasy dwarves but ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it, dwarves are cool.  The setting of the game does a few neat things to try and separate it from it's bog-standard fantasy and I definitely appreciate that.  The writing in general, outside of general worldbuilding, is pretty compelling too.  It feels like some companions got a bit more attention than others, but each one of them feels distinct with their own backgrounds, personalities, flaws, and goals.  Dialogue is consistently well written and companions arcs as they get deeper into their questlines is nice to watch and be a part of.  Inter-party drama between companions is interesting and a nice detail not a whole lot of RPGs care to put in.  My personal favorite companion is the Red Prince; he's such a lovable ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and his voice actor is on spot.  Now onto the ""role playing"" itself.  A lot of people seem to have forgotten that RPGs as we know it were built upon the foundation of tabletop roleplaying games.  Y'know, games where you actually make a character and have to, to a certain extent, act out their personality and put yourself into their shoes.  Divinity lets you do that, at least to an extent that doesn't detract from the core of the game.  While I appreciate their attempts, and the writing does help make some of these roleplaying moments hit their mark, there's a disconnect between the game and it's attempt to let you roleplay.    Firstly; It's just straight up better to end almost all conflicts in the game by killing the bastard.  You gain no XP, or at least not comparable XP, for talking or slying your way out of a difficult situation when compared to just murdering the poor soul.  I understand it'd probably be a bit difficult to try and balance this out; someone passes their speech check and then murders them anyway, gaining double XP.  But there's a solution out there somewhere that is well balanced while still letting players roleplay their characters.  But as the game is right now, it's just better to murder hobo your way though most of the game.  Secondly; Persuasion mechanics are very weird and not very transparent as of now.  Usually some dialogue choices with have [Wits] or [Strength] next to them when trying to convince another character.  This gives the impression that this game is doing what Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 1 & 2 did; giving you special dialogue options just for being your character.  Your character shouldn't have to be a smooth talking son of a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• to talk themselves out of every situation.  A particularly strong character can bully someone into submission; a perceptive person can read their body language and make inferences as to that persons intentions or thoughts.  You have a character with 30 Strength who wants to intimidate someone, but then you fail.  What happened?  Did you put one too many points into Contitution?  No.  Persuasion mechanics are just poorly handled.  I'm not 100% sure how they work, but some pesuasion attempts are pointless.  They SEEM to key off an ability, but in fact they don't and are just guaranteed to fail.  Some persuasion checks do seem to work ala Fallout 1/2/NV, but most require at least one point in persuasion, if not more.  Not only are the Persuasion mechanics non-transparent (unlike almost all the other bits of crunch in the game), but the game seems to be almost misleading it's players into thinking that the mechanics work a different way, when they do not.  I think the way Fallout NV handled persuasion is probably the best way an RPG can handle it.   But for the most part, just ignore my tangent on the roleplaying aspects of the game.  The rest of the experience is fantastic.  This is easily the best RPG I have played since The Witcher 3 dropped two years ago.  This game might not be for all people, but I can confidently say that it tickled my pickle.  Pros: * It's pretty. * Soundtrack is sick * Deep and meaningful character creation and building * Consistently good writing and voice action throughout * The crunch is good * Doesn't hold your hand * At least 40 hours worth of content in the base game, plus replay value, plus mods, plus multiplayer/coop, plus GM mode * You get to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• just about every companion * You get to hear the Red Prince ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• another lizard * Gay relationships  Cons: * Persuasion is poop * Roleplay is (kinda) poop * Somewhat buggy launch (last few updates were big and had major bug fixes though)"

It would be nice if you can drag a small window on the map and then the real world camera follows it, like those RTS game.   -Character movement speed, this is painful, I constantly going to wrong place, thanks to it's quest log, so I have to look at map again, move my camera on top of the right place, click on it, and wait for a minute for my character walk to the location, and this happens really often, wish they could add in the mechanic that double the time speed.  -Doesn't have a key that trigger all the NPC names, you have to mouse over them to see their names.  9.5\10, those are all the small problems, nothing major, and easy to fix, the game is still amazing, I wish they would do something like Dragon Age Origin, which allow you to switch between 3rd person and top down camera angle, the game definitely have the potential to do that, it also would fix a couple problem I adressed, but it just a personal opinion.

Musketeered,111,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,95.9,When I played the first one I thought it was amazing. Thought where can they improve on this. Well they did in so many ways.  Origin Stories are amazing. I played Loshe in my first playthrough and being possessed by a demon I had all sorts of interesting encounters like when I played my lute and the demon forced me to smash it. I mean I could go on but I don't normally bother writing reviews and this is just for the achievement. Point being if you have any love for RPG's with great turn based combat then you should absolutely buy this game.

Fred FredBurger,355,1,0,May 28,Recommended,48.6,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is OKAY at BEST. I wholeheartedly agree with some of the more critical reviews.  The first chapter of Fort Joy is the highlight of the game and after that it starts turning mediocre at times.  I tend to be a completionist. I was level 7 on all of my characters escaping Fort Joy and the game became tedious and boring to me in the swamp area.  At some point in the game you will realize that your choices really do not matter and that out of 4 dialogue options, you really only have 2 that are different. I cannot find myself to beat this game even after leaving the swamp area.  It sucks at times.  It's so boring watching the combat and the fights now are all the same crap. Even on normal difficulty the balance between easy fights and difficult feels off.  I shouldn't have left Fort Joy at level 7 (average is around level 5 i believe) but that's what the game allowed and I suffered for it. I don't feel divine. I don't feel powerful. I feel like I am doing chores running around and watching boring‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•fight scenes and I'm not alone.  To add to this if you just wanted to rush through the story you would be underleveled and then have an extremely difficult time all the time.  This game needs dynamic balancing badly.  My friends all bought this game and we don't play multiplayer anymore. I am the only one who got past 40 hours of playtime and I regret it. 5/7 would game again."
Xariann,233,1,0,May 28,Recommended,27.0,"Wow! What a game! It's been a while since a game managed to hold my attention for a substantial length of time and this one certainly did.  I never finished the first Original Sin, and I wasn't sure if I was going to finish this one. I mainly lacked brain power to finish the first one after a long day of work. However, I guess now I am in a different place and I very much enjoy the depth of the stories, the many ways of getting to a result, the graphics and the combat. Having played my fair share of Might and Magic, XCom and XCom 2 I thought this was going to be a walk in the park for me, but I couldn't be further from the truth.  If you like fantasy, classic RPG elements, rich story and satisfying strategy combat I would encourage you to get this game. And don't forget you can play it with friends too."

EnthusiasticTaco,43,1,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,35.3,"This game starts very strong but has the common inconsistencies of RPG, Free dialogue style play. (Similar to Fallout, Elder scrolls). I have spent almost 40 hours in the game to date and have enjoyed it, however, I never feel this game draws you into the world. It doesn't deserve 9/10 ratings, it is 7/10 at best. There are some game breaking mechanics that weaken a class or particular set of abilities.  Teleport is overwhelmingly overpowered, it literally breaks every aspect of the game if you use it right. You can completely alter the desired mechanic of a fight by using it. (unfairly) For example, Whilst a boss, I teleported him to my party and immediately killed him alone, well before his allies could help him and then when a neutral add spawned, i teleported his party members to the neutral add to get cleaved and then had to just fight the neutral add.   For example, Having a mage/wizard doing damage in a party primarily built up of Physical dps (Enemies have two forms of Armour, Physical and Magical) is pointless.  Their value as damage dealers drops to zero, they will hardly break-through any magical armour alone.  ""Tank"" classes don't exist as taunt has too short of a range, and most times your enemies will be immune to taunt.  I enjoyed the game, but simple things like save files and fast travels legitamtely break any immersion. You can save game in the middle of a fight and alter it to achieve victory at certain points. In one quest chain, your party is separated intentionally for the purpose of the quest. However, you can just fast travel to the centre of the quest zone with each individual character, there-by eliminating any effort.  The good;  Voice acting is incredible, if you enjoy DnD, then you'll love this game. Classical mode seems like the perfect ""Normal"" - It is challenging/formidable if you brazenly walk into a room of enemies, but if you draw them through fire or into a choke point then it becomes an even playing field.  LoS is your friend.  Probably the best turn based strategy game i've played to date.  Sneak and Thievery is just plain OP, you can't go without it.  Being able to sneak and put explosive barrels around enemies is vital to success in many fights, especially against stronger mobs.    Buy the game and make an opinion yourself. I stopped enjoying it at close to 40 hours played. The story was boring and uninteresting and even at 40 hours (Which is half way through the game).  Still worth a pick up - but the game really comes down to personal taste, it doesn't appeal to me.  i would love to see more games with this classical mode difficulty, by far that was the most interesting aspect of the game."

Quality Player,255,1,0,"August 1, 2017",Recommended,85.7,"Quick disclaimers: First, I have played less than 6 hours. If you have played Divinity before, you will know that this means my review should be considered first impressions. Second, I have only played Classic Mode, my so my review will be based entirely upon that experience. Lastly, I have only played the shadowblade class so far.  TL;DR's should come first imo: 1: If you liked Divinity: Original Sin, you will enjoy the sequel. 2: If you did not like Divinity: Original Sin, chances are good that you will not enjoy the sequel. 3: If you didn't play Divinity: Original Sin, but like D&D, fantasy, true open-world environments, and the most in-depth RPG you can possibly find, you will like this. If not, you may want to consider something else.  Next I'd like to get 2 small ""issues"" out of the way: 1: The store page boasts new elemental combinations, such as poison and fire to create explosions. However, this specific combo was available in Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition, so it's not something that I would call a new feature considering the Enhanced Edition was provided to owners of Original Sin for free.  2: There is no voiceover. I do consider this a small issue because even though the game has thus far been great without it, it really added a lot to the Enhanced Edition for me, and I feel it would be just as well-recieved in the sequel. Fingers crossed that they make it happen!  The rest of this review is going to be... less than organized. I will do my best to make it coherent, but I make no promises. ;)  So far I have found the combat to be challenging, but it also hasn't been terribly fun. I feel as though I need a few more levels and a few more spell slots before it gets to the point of being both fun AND challenging. Or perhaps my party is less than optimal; that is entirely probable since I've accidentally brought another shadowblade even though I am already a shadowblade... Granted, this has already made for an... err... interesting encounter involving a teleporting crocodile. Yes... a teleporting crocodile. It's just as terrifying as you think it is.  The RPG system is absolutely fantastic. It's incredibly interesting trying to balance your character's personality with how your NPC party members would like to be treated. For instance (!!!!WARNING: SPOILER!!!!) if you want the elf girl with the backstory (I'm so sorry, I'm terrible with names) to join your party, you have to let her gore a lizard by saying that you trust her completely (a previous experience with another backstory party member lead me to believe this was the correct choice to build trust with the elf. I did not gain any trust. It... may have still been the correct decision? I'm not sure, I didn't save/reload to find out.). Afterwards she wants you to let her speak to another person alone. I brought up the fact that she had just gored the last person I let her speak to, and the next person she wanted to speak to HEARD ME AND RESPONDED by saying ""There's no need for any of that here."" or something along those lines. I was seriously not expecting that. It's honestly some next-level immersion. Truly fantastic stuff, and I'm sure it will be a recurring thing throughout the game; that's just how Larion does things.  One negative (for me) has to do with the movement system. It's exactly the same as the first Original Sin, which means it is fairly clunky, and can lead to some poor situations resulting from accidentally stealing something. There are also issues with trying to navigate when something is in the foreground. Basically, you're pretty much always going to accidentally move your mouse over the thing in the foreground and it's going to mess with your pathing immensely. Unfortunately, the first area you arrive in is filled with tall objects to get in the way, which results in too much camera movement just to get around. I hope they fix this by making the camera view through buildings in the foreground much wider, and possibly a method that would allow clicking or holding the LMB to ignore foreground buildings.  I'm not really sure what else to say. So far it's turning out great! It looks gorgeous and runs well. The RPG system is amazing. Combat is a little rough so far, but again... 6 hours isn't much for this game, and I spent a lot of that time talking to NPCs, so I don't feel that I have even touched the surface of the combat. Heck, I haven't even played with friends yet! Speaking from my experience in the first Original Sin, this game is practically guaranteed to be better if you're playing with people you like. Even with the flawed movement system, I already think this game is worth the current (as of writing) $45 asking price."

Deltarizon,104,1,0,April 6,Recommended,175.3,"Well lets start off with a brief description of the game. You're a captive on a ship, a Sourceror, one of the most hated people across the land. Your foul magic attracts monstrosities known as the Voidwoken, nightmares from another dimension that seek to claim this world as their own. However, things quickly roll out of hand, and it ends with the ships destruction. Finding yourself on the prison island known as Fort Joy, you discover that you're no ordinary Sourceror; you have the potential to become a GOD. From there, the game plays out quite literally as YOU choose it, be it as a benevolent hero seeking to save the world or as a malicious villain who seeks to gain ultimate power. And, just maybe, you'll find an option that no one else expected, one that takes you through the Void itself... and finding power that scoffs at the Gods themselves.  As you can probably tell, there's a lot of choices to be made in Divinity 2 : Original Sin, and maybe you're thinking ""Oh god, it's another one of these games that plays out as a visual novel instead of a rpg"". Well if you are thinking that, shut the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up, strap in, and read up ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• because there's quite a bit more to the game than that.   Now, the best part about this game is it's combat system and character progression; there are few other games where I can actually feel the progression of my character and the impact it has on the world around me. For example, in my very first TRUE playthrough of the game, 100% it, I did it with just two characters, both of them basically assassins; it was hard at first of course, but by the end of the game I could clear a room of 12 heavily armored characters with 2 characters and taking no damage. It truly felt powerful, and is one of my favorite gaming playthroughs of all time. So I thought, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it, lets try a magical playthrough, might not be as fun as the first, but we'll get through it. Well. Lets just say a full elementalist party is quite a unique experience. The whole 4 person party felt powerful the entire game, and we destroyed everything in sight that we deemed ""Unholy"" or ""Unclean"". Felt ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing hilarious the entire way through, and I don't regret a moment of it. For my thrid play through, I went in with a full melee team, and got the exact same results, which has blown me out of the water and clear into the sky; the fact that no matter what kind of team you play you know you'll become a force to be reckoned with is fantastic, and lets you cook up some pretty kooky team compilations. If you don't believe me, go on youtube and look up some of the SOLO builds people can make; they play on the highest difficulty and can quite literally nuke entire areas with a single character. But I digress, that's a bit off topic, and not relevant to this review. So if you've ever felt let down by a characters power or capability, trust me, you won't feel that with this game.  Let's talk diversity for a quick second here. There are 4 main races in the world, the Dwarves, Humans, Elves, and Lizards. Each race has its own unique capabilities, and it's own racial traits, meaning that yes, while you can have a Lizard assassin, making it a human so it have bonus initiative (how soon it gets to move in combat) and extra critical chance (random extra damage) means you'll have an easier time. Or maybe you'll choose a lizard for your geomancer because you have the innate ability to breath fire, and ignite your oil based abilities. A dwarven Inquisitor stands ready to rush into your opponents because they have extra defenses against all forms of damage. And maybe your necromancer is an elf because elves can eat parts of their enemies to learn memories and skills they'd normally never obtain. No matter what it is, you'll find tons of combinations based off of race alone to make a unique and fun character. But is that where it stops? Nope, that's where we're just getting started. See, there is a unique twist you can put on a character; you can make them UNDEAD. Yes, that's right, a skeleton that walks and talks, and which offers other unique pros and cons. For example, an undead character will heal when poisoned, and take damage when healed normally. Skeletons can use their bony fingers as infinite use lockpicks. And most importantly, Skeletons don't have any nasty organs to inhale Deathfog, an uncommon terrain in the game which kills anything that breaths it, meaning that Undead are free to wander through it as they please. The only real downside is having to wear a headpiece at all times. (Which isn't even a downside, like, why would you decide to not wear an important piece of equipment?) But lets say you dislike making all of that troublsome character stuff, you just want to get in and have fun. Well, there are already a ton of premade characters with their own stories and quests to go on if you so choose! There's literally no way to go wrong with making a character in this game!  Hey, we almost missed the most important part of the game, the part where you become a god and stuff! Well friendo, that's what I saved for last because that‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•is called SPOILERS, and I know that some people dislike those. So let it be said now that if you don't want to read any spoilers WHATSOEVER, then you should skip the next paragraph. Cool? Cool.  So as your character progresses through the game, they will discover the ability to use Source to fuel abilities. These are their godly powers, and are only usable by player characters and certain other npcs. This includes the abilites; Bless : Buffs an ally and clears any and all curses that afflict them. Spirit Vision : Is actually free to cast, and lets you temporarily see into the spirit realm, where you can see parts of the past, and even talk with the dead to gain their wisdom. (Or even just to taunt an enemy who bugged you.) Devour : Not it's actual name, but I don't use it often enough to remember it. It's also free to cast. You basically target an enemy corpse (or even just directly target their ghost.) and devour their essence, regaining a source point. Doing this too many times however can mark you with the ""Villain"" tag, which is not what you want to have on you if you're roleplaying as a benevolent hero. Gate : Again, isn't the true spell name, but works the same as the D&D version, creating a permanent link to another location within range that anyone can go through at any time. It sounds kind of dumb at first, but it lets you pull off some pretty wacky stunts in the game, and I've taken it on every character I've made so far. There are of course tons of other abilities that can be fueled by source points, far too many to list them all here, as each class has a few ""Ultimate"" abilities that you need source to use. But if you're interested in learning more about these godlike powers, then just look up a class guide and check out their abilities to get an idea of what you can work with!  Alright, well I think that if you've read everything I've said so far, that you'll get the idea I'm trying to tell you. The game's fantastic, and fun to play, especially with friends. One of the best campaigns we had was one where the entire party split up and fought to become the ultimate character. So if you enjoy shennanigans like that, and you love the sound of this game, then take a go at it! I really think that you'll enjoy the hell out of it!"

There is good reason to collect ingredients because they actually are valuable. The combat system is easy to understand and get into and allows you that great feeling of accmomplishment when you use superior strategy. The story is a good mix between familiar elements from past RPGs and new ideas and twists that keeps the game fresh and exciting.  Definitely a game most cRPG-lovers won't regret picking up!

Phantasmio,316,1,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,92.6,"A masterpiece of an RPG. I am brand new to the Divinity series. I haven't been this hooked on an RPG since titles like the original Dragon Age and the KOTOR games.  Incredible world, story, immersion and voice acting, gorgeous graphics and environments, solid strategic turn-based gameplay. I am floored that literally the first region kept me engaged for right around 16 hours where I finally felt ready to leave the place behind, and I STILL MISSED THINGS!  There have been so many moments and decisions I've already made where I go from joy and satisfaction, to curiosity and concern, to ""Welp, this just screwed up royally."" You have so much freedom and flexibility to do and act as you please, way more than I anticipated. You can fight and kill literally anything you see, which can result in loot, intense battles, quest progression, and/or outright closing out quest lines you wouldn't have expected.   You can play the ENTIRE game with up to four players in co-op, but you don't even have to be tied together to each other like you'd expect. You can go your own seperate ways, complete entire storylines and battle in completely different parts of the map, and can even declare war on each other if you please!  I haven't tried Dungeon Master mode, but essentially from what I've seen, its a mode where you can create custom campaign with a DM and four players playing in the DM's world, which they have absolute control over.  Every line is beautifully voice-acted and written, giving you the best of both worlds when it comes to taking in the story and events going on around you. You can either create your own custom character or go with one of the fully fleshed out stories of one of the Origin characters. I'd recommend going with an Origin character on your first playthrough, their stories are fantastically done, you'll find unique dialogue options in various conversations tied to the Origin character you're playing.  Combat itself is a very solid, generally a good challenge on normal difficulty and turn-based flavored, but with a major twist you won't typically see in RPGs. Your armor (both magic and physical) both act as their own health bar that prevent your Vitality (your actual HP) from decreasing.  Armor also will allow your character to resist negative status effects until it's drained. Physical will resist status effects such as Knock Down and Stuns until, while Magic will resist Status effects like Frozen, Petrify, Poisoned (unless you're undead) and more. You also have elemental resistances, which lower the damage of elemental attacks and helps you resist elemental-based status effects.  You can do extra damage with ranged attacks from high ground and decrease range damage you receive. Character deaths are permenant, and from what I've seen so far, you and your Party Members can only be revived with a Ressurection Scroll.  You have a bunch of different starting ""class"" templates to pick from, which can be fully modified to your content as you make your character. I say ""class"" because you can build yourself however you want. Just because you picked a Rogue, doesn't mean you have to exclusively be a rogue throughout the game. You can hybridize yourself as much as you please, so long as you have the skill points and buy the ability books to learn new skills from that class. You can even respec and recustomize yourself and party freely once you get out of the first region.  Lastly, you have Source Points, your Deus Ex Machina of abilites. These are your game-changer moves that are very powerful and usually something you'll reserve for dire circumstances, as Source is something you must find in the world, regained through rare items, or consume with certain abilties from corpses. You can also find Source Fountains, which have unlimited Source. I have only found two so far, one in each of the two regions I've been in, so I would have to say they are extremely rare. As long as you remember where they are or place a waypoint so you don't forget, you can always return to refill your party with Source.   Reviews alone cannot do it justice. I've been eyeballing this title for a while throughout it's early access and I only picked this up after hearing some great praise from a friend. I haven't been able to put it down since. The quality of this title is just incredible. If you love RPGs, save up the cash for it and get this title in your steam library ASAP."
Kawaii Thuggin‚Äô,105,1,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,61.4,"Honestly a breathtaking game. I know I'm not even halfway through but I'm looking forward to more. Eat, Sleep, play Divinity.  **EDIT**   I really enjoy playing this game couch co-op, split screened. Classic mode. Just defeated Bishop Alexander and it wasn't such a horrific fight (Boyfriend and I were quite anxious). If you've read on it, you do kinda have to pull some cheesy strats, but hey, this is ""cheese"" the game. Looking forward to way more and I can't wait to give my full review of this game.   P.S. Also if anyone is having trouble with the Bishop Alexander boss fight I've got one (or two)  key tip(s) for you...   Height. Get to the highest point possible on the battleground map, which is on the left of the battlefield. Have one character trigger the dialogue and have the rest go around the side and make it to the hghest point (it's where the mage lady is or whatever); during the dialogue you can teleport the character to where the rest of y'all are positioned. Make sure you teleport during the dialogue or else that character is dead in the middle of the fight until you get to a character that can tele that character to a safe point. Also the wormy will mainly proc wherever there's more characters (basically wherever the most aggro is being pulled towards, so avoid hitting the worm until the end cuz the worm will fight the magisters & Alexander for you). Good luck!   "

Oberain,583,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,170.0,"I'm going to be honest here; I didn't like the first Original Sin.  I found the combat surprisingly clunky, the ""two protagonist"" playstyle akin to mashing action figures together as a child and the NPCs bland and empty.  Just everything about it wasn't as good as the raving crowds claimed.    This?  This is amazing.  This is so far one of my favorite PC RPGs I've ever played...and I'm old enough to remember the original Ultima and Gold Box DnD games.  Most areas and quests have multiple solutions and you're not really punished for taking one over the other.  There are a few areas where lockpicking is basically required but besides that stealth, conversation or brute force are typically viable options to dealing with a problem.  Combat feels tactical (something most RPGs frankly don't really do anymore) with your choices in positioning, abilities and terrain manipulation meaning the difference between victory or defeat more often than just pure stats.  With careful planning you can beat groups of enemies better geared and higher levels than you, though it's still unlikely as one lucky crit can one shot a character.  There are very few mindless ""throw away"" battles once you leave the tutorial island.  Almost every encounter will be an actual fight for your life.  There are some areas the game can be improved further.  While your companions will pipe up more and put more of their character on display than the original, it's not quite enough.  The process in which it happens is sterile and lacks organic interaction.   Instead of the NPCs talking as if the other NPCs were standing around them, they spout their one line and that's it.  If, say, the Red Prince spoke to Fane or Sebille during the journey it would go a long way to viewing them as characters instead of interchangable henchmen that happened to have a  bit of backstory or a sidequest attached. So yes, as much as people like to‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•on Bioware...this could benefit by being more like Bioware in that regard.  Another complaint is I never feel like I'm at the point I'm supposed to be at with gear.  I consistantly feel like I'm a few levels behind with my armor and health offering a totally negligable amount of protection with some enemies wiping my party before I even get a turn.  I don't even know how the game can really ""fix"" this other than perhaps tossing in an NPC somewhere explaining that each level gives shops DRAMATICALLY better gear and the difference between level 10 and level 12 is roughly 150% increase in defense.   Oh and do ignore the publications out there that act like plaiyng Undead is sooo hard.  You literally NEVER have a reason to not be in full armor and you can easily heal from poison damage and poison potions.  It's really not a challenge at all.  Edit and Addtions:  I had originally complained at some poor coding regarding playing a non-origin character and how playing an undead PC made the game think you were Fane leading to some broken quests and ridiculous immersion breaking dialogue.  It seems since launch most of these issues have been patched and some major story moments have been reworked.  It's disappointing they were in the game at all as I can't fathom why anyone would WANT to play as an ""origin"" companion instead of a real character and why playing a real character would end up being so buggy but...that's just me."
Behemoth,662,1,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,46.6,"A truly incredible CRPG. The best modernization of the genre that has yet been made.  So many options.

The size of the screen you get up is stupidly tiny compare to your own inventory screen. The chest has absolutly no sorting for easy acsess to spesific items, everythiong is in the order you put into it.  2: not enough customization you can do to character, well there is, but its not enough  3: spellbooks you have allready learned says you allready learned, but its not true for skillbooks or books, adding a simple ""book allready read"" would be super handy  Im still gonna play this game alot, more than once"

RyoheiT,101,1,0,"December 23, 2017",Recommended,273.2,"Ahhh, Divinity Original Sin...I'm a huge fan of both the first game and the second one. It's the kind of game you'd want if you're into the PURE essence of RPG and want the game to last for a loooong time. The origin characters is very appealing and hilarious. The story of the game is very interesting and immersive. The music is beautiful and the overall gameplay is amazing!  I strongly recommend this game for anyone that wants to have a great time with their friends as well as playing alone. The amount of strategies and tricky plays you have to make (At least on Tactician mode) is just lovely and once you win a battle you really feel like you've accomplished something! :D  My advice to new players however is to start it on Classical mode; as once you feel like the game might be a bit too easy for you or once you've grasped the concept of the game and believe yourself to handle a bit more, you can change the difficulty to ""Tactician"" which make the AI's a lot smarter and thoughtful. Also buffing their Health, Defense and Magic Armor.  Keep in mind that once you've gone from Classical to Tactician you cannot revert on that savefile!! Secondly; Please try out the Origin characters on your first playthrough; as they come with a built-in little campaign of their own with a lot of extra details to quests and NPCs as you advance into later Arcs!  Most of all; Have fun in this amazing game!!  ~Ryohei~"

Valchrys,51,1,0,March 31,Recommended,357.8,"It's hard not to recommend the game because the engine has so much potential. There's a good game somewhere in here, but it's not the campaign. At least, not the end game.  I've spent hours carefully building the party's gear. But in act 4, every attack by an npc instantly stripes all the physical and magical armor off the entire party in one round. In the same round, the same npc that destroyed the entire party's armor will then cc the entire party. There's no tactics here.  I would say you can't approach the campaign like it's a traditional rpg, it's not. As a player, your goal is to break the game by finding the exploits the encounter designers didn't foresee. The encounter design is just terrible which is a shame given the potential of the game engine.  The only other thing that's really bad is the inventory management. There has got to be a better way for RPG's than having to manage hundrends of pieces of loot, most of which is useless. I would suggest to any RPG designer who wants to have a crafting system to have a way to turn that system off and hide the loot that is designed for that system. I'm getting physically sick organizing my party's bags so that I can find things when I want them. If I play again, I know enough now to avoid picking up crafting materials.  In short, the problems with this game are the stupid, gimmicky encounter design and the inventory management minigame. I hope that someone in the community will write a decent campaign for this game. Of course, that assumes that near infinite action points for the npc's and over the top damage isn't hardcoded into the game."

Pepin,257,1,0,September 9,Recommended,358.1,"So, my original review was too long for steam, so I have had to cut it down in places ÔÅå Let me just say here that I love the game, although it isn‚Äôt perfect I admit. It is one of the best co-op games I have ever played, and this adds extra replay value for me personally. I have never been interested in the PvP matches, so I can‚Äôt speak of that myself. Below is all I could squeeze in, but I hope it showcases my opinion and experiences of the game.  Divinity Original Sin 2 (DOS2 from here out) is a CRPG with players having a party of up to 4 characters. The game uses a fairly familiar stat pool, which you can increase each level (Strength, Intelligence etc), but also includes talents (Feats) for some cool bonuses and ability points which can add things like damage, access to new skills, lockpicking and so on. Combat is turn based, and gets really interesting with the combinations of elemental puddles, clouds and status effects in play. The story is divided into four Acts, across four separate but distinctive areas, with side quests and companion quests spanning each one.  I love a good story in my RPGs and CRPGs so I usually put a lot of stock into this aspect of the game. DOS2 story was ‚Äògood‚Äô and felt interesting enough, with enough little twists to keep my attention for the duration of the game. As a story overall, I didn‚Äôt think that it did anything majorly unique, it didn‚Äôt challenge the players concepts of anything in particular, but it served the purpose as a framing device for propelling the player through the acts nicely. This may seem like a criticism, but really it isn‚Äôt any more than the ‚Äòfeeling‚Äô I had playing through. I felt DOS2 does a lot better job with the story than Pillars of Eternity 2, but perhaps not quite as solid as something like Baldurs Gate 2, so take that as you will. The theme is somewhat a mixture of serious plot, with little nuggets of humour thrown in, which I like. In places the game absolutely does not take things too seriously, and there have been multiple times where I have had a little laugh out loud. Not tearing my sides or anything, but there are many chuckles to be had through the game.  The companions are well done, for the most part. Each has their own quest line and unique interactions with other NPCs throughout the world you‚Äôre in and this can lead to some genuinely surprising moments, and in some cases just having a specific person with you can land you in hot water. I personally applaud this because I feel it makes the world a little more ‚Äòalive‚Äô than some other titles. You might play through once with certain party members (or with none) and then on a subsequent game you might take other companions and get different reactions with NPCs you‚Äôd never really noticed before. The quest lines for your companions are (for the most part) well done. They‚Äôre long and detailed enough that you care about their story, and don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs a glorified side quest. Voice acting is done well throughout and I‚Äôm glad Larian Studios took the time to implement it into the game, and then improve it for the Definitive Edition, in places it felt a little lacking. Just a little side note here‚Ä¶If you‚Äôre standing in a densely populated area of NPCs, expect to hear lines of dialogue repeated ad nauseam. I‚Äôm looking at you market place of Driftwood‚Ä¶Still, it‚Äôs not quite as irritating as the man with many cheeses from Original Sin 1.  Graphically I love how the game looks. Traversing the world feels wonderful, and if it‚Äôs a new area you never know when a fight might break out or a dialogue option pops up with a player decision to be had. The animations of the characters are a pleasure to watch, and personally I love the look and feel of the spells. I have made a purely Air based mage for this reason alone, and I‚Äôm having a wonderful time so far. Another thing I have been critical of in the past is when battles take place in previously used ‚Äòmaps‚Äô or ‚Äòtiles‚Äô (sorry to bring you up again Pillars of Eternity 2). I believe Larian deserve praise for not having this in DOS2. I appreciate that, when entering a battle, it is not like other games where you‚Äôre ‚Äòtransported‚Äô to a ‚Äòbattle map‚Äô, it just happens in real time, but when I was exploring or fighting in the game I never felt like ‚ÄúOh, this area again‚Äù and I appreciate that.   I do want to point out that the music in this game is just amazing and really adds another dimention to the experience. I know Larian spent a lot of time on this, and it really pays off. I find myself humming the theme music and battle music on a constant basis after I've played (much to the annoyance of those around me, since I am as musically gifted as a deaf otter).  Quality of life issues have been improved upon from both the first game, and the non-Definitive version of this game, which I really appreciate. Managing the inventory is nice and easy, transferring items between characters is fairly intuitive, the journal has been improved to be a little less of a cluster duck, and overall the UI is well presented. I‚Äôd like to expand this section, but I don‚Äôt feel there is anything specific that needs addressing. It simply works, and works well, so I‚Äôll leave it at that.  DOS2 does not use a traditional ‚Äòclass‚Äô system. Sure, you can make an archetypal Rogue, or Mage or Warrior etc, but you are never locked into anything. If you‚Äôre playing a heavily armoured Warrior wielding a two-handed hammer but you like the look of a buff spell like Fortify, just drop a point into Geomancer upon level up and learn the skill. Done. This adds a great deal of flexibility to character builds and playstyles, which really helps the combat of this game and your feeling that this is *your* character. I could talk all day about builds and ability combinations, but for the purposes of keeping this to a (somewhat) reasonable length I will say that character customization is huge part of this game.  Combat in this game is perhaps the biggest positive I can say, which is why it will be another long section (sorry, not sorry). As previously mentioned it is turn based, and tactical combat. The combat works on a 360 degree movement range (that is to say, it isn‚Äôt grid based), with advantages to having higher ground (insert Episode 3 meme here), and controlling the battlefield through a mixture of crowd control abilities and surface types. You can create combos with yourself or other party members by mixing certain elements too. For example you can make it rain, which adds the ‚ÄòWet‚Äô status effect to enemies in an area, then go for a frost type spell, which will then potentially freeze your opponent(s), making them skip their next turn. That being said, Armour types are a thing introduced since the first Original Sin. If you want to get certain status effects onto an enemy you will need to strip them of their ‚Äòmagical armour‚Äô to do so. Usually by hitting them with magical attacks. For players using physical attacks, you will need to bust through enemy physical armour, before you can do things like knock them down, or cripple them, etc. This is such a huge part of the gameplay that it is impossible to cover in a review without going on for days, or making a lengthy video, so please feel free to look on YouTube or wherever if you want to see this in action.  Balance can be skewed through the game, which is my only real negative point (something which Larian has worked on to improve). Act 1 can be rough, but by the time you hit level 16, you definitely notice a jump in your parties power, which can trivialise some encounters. For those looking for a more consistent challenge I recommend Tactician Mode.   Overall I highly recommend this game for people who are fans of CRPGs and like (or don‚Äôt mind) turn based combat, with a real focus on positioning and a tactical approach. It isn‚Äôt perfect, but it‚Äôs extremely enjoyable to play either solo, or with friends."

Dirty Dan,252,1,0,"September 15, 2016",Recommended,17.6,"Really good Early Access. Still a bit rough around the edges (Dialogue is a bit wonky, no voice acting, movement can be weird, I recently had an error where I could see everyone's detection radius around them as if I was stealthed) but very playable and very fun. Absolutely gorgeous too, and the soundtrack is as good as ever (Also lets you choose what the main instrument will be for your soundtrack? Interesting and actually pretty neat). I loved the first game but I already love the sequel more, the interface is much simpler and less tedious and the character customization is fantastic. Totally recommend it in early access."

And even though I have plenty of games with over 1000 hours in not a single one of them can match the sheer amount of fun I had every hour I played in this game. Every hour I played in this game matched my favorite hours in Stellaris, Planetside 2, Crusader Kings 2, Civilization 5, the list goes on. I generally don't play this style of game, it's not usually what I get the most fun out of. But I can say for certain that even though this is one of my less played games by several orders of magnitude it is leagues ahead of what have previously been my favorite games of my life."

Rendo,75,1,0,"November 12, 2017",Recommended,289.5,"This review is somewhat limited as I have yet to fully complete the story, nor tried the dnd mode, yet I have a good idea of everything the game has to offer.   I think Larian have done a fantastic job in creating a grounded, well-rounded, and enthralling RPG. The narrative is imagnitive and captivating. Characters and npcs are unique and interesting, with good voice acting they really feel like individuals who each have their own personalilty, some could respond well to charm, others might threaten to kill you. Combat is challenging, fluid, and forces you to stay alert, using your head to figure out the best action to take. The visuals are gorgeous for the type of game it is and help to preserve the verisimiltude of the world.   One thing I would note is that the game is designed to be challenging by nature and is sometimes very slow and frustating, so if you lack patience and prefer only action, it might not be the game for you. For those of us who grew up playing Final Fantasy or other turn-based games, it is a very refreshing reminder of how fun these games can be if done right, especially with the unique twists this title adds. I would fully recommend the game, to the stage I am even using it for a college project where my task is to create an informative video, similar to ones seen by Mark Brown."
Frankie the Frog,133,1,0,"November 23, 2017",Recommended,122.6,"This game is easily better than the first. The graphics are impeccable and the voice acting and story continue to amaze me.

Fat Cat on Mars,285,1,0,"October 2, 2017",Recommended,68.4,"While the game is not without its issues, so far it is possible the most beautiful RPG I have played in both story lore and visuals, and I am not a huge fan of the CRPG genre, only having played Pillars of Eternity before this.  I have yet to finish my very first run, but I can not recommend this game enough to fans of even just the RPG genre in general. There are a few issues regarding performance and not all the bugs have been squashed, but I highly urge paying the full price instead of waiting for a sale."
akiraxander,"1,156",1,0,"November 12, 2017",Recommended,74.5,"Another excellent top down RPG. I didn't like it as much as the first one, felt they made the UI worse and found myself getting frustrated more at the story choices. Allot of no win scenarios, quicksave is friend.

The combat is really good, can fight in many inventive ways should you wish and on the harder difficulties you definietly have to plan out what you tactics will be, I probably lost 15-20 hours of gameplay due to having to reload after failing at various battles but I still carried on playing it.  The story is cool and I defintely like having a good story line in the games that I play.

My first play through took me a  100 hours to finish, and yet still opening many more possibilities had I chosen different paths given by the game.  The game has a high valaue for replayability with an assurance that succeeding playthroughs will give you a different experience.    Last time I got so much hyped for a game was The Witcher 3.  TW3 set the standard for modern RPGs, and basically how good a game should be for a full 60$.  but this game, I think, is setting a new standard!  And its not even a  full 60$ game!  10/10"

Kharn Terrer,131,1,0,April 13,Recommended,385.2,"One of the best games I've played in a very long time. It has captured all the fun of older rpgs such as Icewind Dale, Baldurs Gate 2 and Neverwinter Nights and expanded on it.  The game system is really fun and the fact that your initial choice isnt the be all and end all makes for a diversive game which you can evolve your character.  The traditional RPG feel in this game is massive and the lack of silly over the top new measures that are designed to get CoD players to like it is even better.  The story is amazing and the end boss battle was one of the best battles I've done in a long time. Its refreshing to play a game that isnt a total letdown or isnt filled with micro transactions.    10/10 would play again and again and again, hope they make another one."

Shadow,157,1,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,11.6,"So my early impressions:  Pro's  Good Graphics Good Sound Amazing character creation (I recommend Origin Character)  Con's  ~The questing can be difficult as the game does not exactly tell you where to go or what to do. There are some quest markers on the map but not for all quests. Basically if you enjoy a ton of exploring this game is for you. Personally I like my quests to be more laid out, it's just a choice thing. ~I also find the game fights to be very challenging, but also overly reliant on the game wanting you to use elemental combos. Trying to beat down an oppenent that is not weak to a certain element or combo just will not work. But using rain then hail, or oil then fire, or rain then electric = easy fight.  If I rated this I would give it a 7/10. If the questing was a tad easier/laid out more clearly it would be a 10/10 for me. Again that is just a personal choice with RPG type games. For sure a buy.  **Edit** Need to patch a few bugs I have found. The main one being the quest journal not updating."

It even doubles your approval for this game if you are a RPG/D&D fan! The genre ""RPG"" is not used lightly, you are going to have the greatest immersive, and also vast experience this year.  So far I prefer the Origin characters cause you're getting more story mode for yourself, instead of just your companions. Speaking of which, the characters have great build, personality and of course, story. Ingredients needed for one to be attatched to a character of your choosing, mine for example being The Red Prince.  Allow me to share a funny tale while I am here...  So I'm in a full party and we decide to pick pocket this guy, but our rogue needs us to distract the guards.

Huge ammount of character customization and reactivity to choices you make it the game with an ending that morphs to your actions.

The 6 origin characters bring out the absolute best in this game. The way each character reacts to the environment and your decisions along the journey will get you hooked.   And the combat... My god if it isn‚Äôt the most fun and addicting thing about this game. The number of classes and skills will guarantee that multiple playthroughs will not be similar.  Now onto the graphics... I don‚Äôt know if can give this game enough praise for their visuals and sound... it will immerse you into this chaotic and brutal world, the shift in music when you journey around will give you goosebumps. Each town and camp feel as if its accompanied with new ambient music.  Even though the price might be high for some, trust me it‚Äôs worth every penny! 70+ hours into the game and I still haven‚Äôt progressed much into the story. If you can try to get at least one friend to join you, I can ensure you that the enjoyment just multiplies.  10/10 A MUST TRY FOR RPG FANS! "

The game has a very casual approach to questing, namely you will never be given a little blip to run to, instead you're going to find yourself reading the clues and finding your way there on your own.  Some of the amazing things you can do on Divinity include : Rob literally every person in the game Murder swathes of people with deathfog barrels Beat up the pope - probably  Honestly, the game has so much content that I can't even pretend to know half of it, but I hope that over a few playthroughs I can atleast learn some of it."

Pros: -‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•load of gear, skills, playstyles, so on and so forth - Fun co-op that works well with friends - Fluid combat, never feel like the game is treating you unfairly. When you get destroyed, you know damn well why.  Cons: - You don't save characters, you save worlds. So you cannot join your friends game and then have them join you later. One player must always be host. The player who isn't host will have absolutely no saved data or files. (I don't know if this is standard or not... just felt sorta odd) - Does not hold your hand at all. Can have brutal save points. It's easy to get lost and not be entirely sure as to where you need to go or what you need to do. (Not technically a con, but may be viewed as one by some) - My game has crashed one time  TL;DR: Buy the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing game. 8/8 gr8 m8"

There is so much to enjoy here and many deep mechanics to exploit.   The most important thing about this for me is that it is fully voice acted and better yet it is done well. There are many moments which the voice acting made the game much more engaging.   The combat is turn based howerevver currently the initiative system is frankly useless. You only need one character with high initiative to go first and one point more than other friendly characters to order them how you wish but it will always be: You, enemy, you, enemy, or enemy, you, enemy, you.   This game is also 100% multiplayer with a specific pet for making it a 2 player instead of a 4 player game."

error0044,160,1,0,April 1,Recommended,37.4,"This is a beautiful game, one of the best-looking games I've ever played. It runs smoothly at 1440p, and the detail is insane.   However, I've spent nearly 40 hours playing so far, and I've only just got past Fort Joy. I've re-rolled characters over and over again to try and find a build that doesn't get constantly slaughtered. I've also tried over and over again to get my party members to be more than useless, but I've had no luck.  This is a strange game to me, because I want to keep playing it, but every time I die I wonder why I'm torturing myself.  This is one of the first games I've played where you need to have a guidebook handy to remember everything. You have to remember which character class can heal, and how. You have to find hidden tricks in the game engine to stay alive in combat. You have to scout out areas without getting automatically sent into combat mode, so you can then arrange your characters strategically and then hope that they are far enough away to stay alive, but no so far that the game engine considers them to be outside of combat and their turn gets skipped.  In short, there is no learning curve to this game. It's more like a learning cliff - you either get it, or you don't. I recoommend this game, reluctantly. It's at least worth the two-hour refund window to see if you can handle it."

Avanglion,39,1,0,September 1,Recommended,417.8,The most fascinating RPG of this style and atmosphere I've played since 'Neverwinter Nights 2: Mask Of The Betrayer'. Usually I avoid comparing labels and franchises but this time I find myself in a lack of words strong enough to describe the enjoyment I feel while playing 'Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition'. Skipped playing the original version intentionally just like I did with DOS 1 in favour of its Enhanced Edition. In both cases I don't regret the decision. I trusted Larian to improve the base games and give them a level of polish only a fanatically devoted gamer can contrive and not only did they deliver but exceeded my expectations tenfold. This is the first game in a decade that I cannot stop playing 25 hours a day and it comes with its own content creation tool which again will be the first I'll actually get to use since I last dabbled with NWN's Aurora toolset. A huge THANK YOU! to Larian and Swen for enduring all the hardships so this moment could come. I wish them all the best. I don't know about tomorrow but today I feel like the future of electronic RPGs is bright and it's only because of the masterpiece that DOS2 DE is.

Foolish Observer,130,1,0,April 29,Recommended,171.1,"Divinity: Original Sin 2 is one of the best rpgs I have ever played. The music is wonderful, the gameplay is amazing, and the writing is top quality. The main selling point of the game is player freedom, and this game does not let you down when it comes to freedom.  This game is the type that you can spend any amount of time, or have any amount of runs going, and everything can still feel fresh and original because X npc didn't die on the second run, or because the cat became a friend, or because any other number of variables that can lead to a run being altered heavily. This game is about as close as you'll get to dnd without needing friends to play dnd with.  The combat is slow, tactical, and can be pretty tough when you haven't gotten the hang of it. Players can make builds that combine classes or are just a powerhouse in one particular type of combat, or they can put all their points into civil skills. Also, elemental combos are awesome. You can set fire to oil puddles or poison clouds, or electrify water/blood or steam, or teleport an oil barrel on top of someone who is on fire which causes them to explode. The amount of different ways you can tackle foes is truly amazing. It's fun, well written, has a great soundtrack, fun combat, and is an all around great way to lose countless hours to a game."

Second time went on to become a divine emperor of holy red dragons, vanquisher of demons, friend of dogs and chickens, the hero of Rivelon.  Third time on tactician, carefully micromanaging every single character, third time is the (or)deal!  And fourth time, going lone wolf, is the creme de la creme. Because every single minute of the game, while realising your own mortality and all the mistakes you've made, you also realize how much you missed during previous playthroughs. And how much you are going to.  And don't get me started on the couch coop factor here... Because this was just the beginning.  Long story short: This is the game you have been waiting for since Baldur's Gate 2. So much to do, so much to see, so much to cheese... together with friends! . . . . . . So many memories..  Like that time when you save a dog from a beggar who exploits him.  Like that time when you play hide and seek with a little kid to take his mind off the horrible fate awaiting him.

Gwynbleidd,86,1,0,January 19,Recommended,109.1,"What a brilliant game.  I am not a great fan of turn-based RPGs (or at least wasn't till now) but D:OS2 really changed that. The combat system is simply epic, both in terms of visuals and dynamics. It is so much fun to fight with strategies and due to the well-balanced difficulties, most of the fights are very exciting.  Exploring is also incredibly fun. The game has maps of decent sizes but more importantly, each act is generously full of well-scripted contents. You never know what you will find but you always know you will find something that makes your exploration valuable!  The story is quite compelling. Side stories, however, are often even more compelling. Additionally, all characters you meet have a personality that speaks to you on a human level. The attention to details for creating such a lively world should really be appreciated. Even animals have individually established personalities that make meeting them much more fun. Similarly, the dialogues are of the same quality. Very good voice acting and very well written lines.  The open-world aspect is, again, very good. The number of options you have through the gameplay is vast and unlike most other open-world games, your choices actually matter. Abundance of options applies not only to your choices of progressing through the storyline but to each part of the game. Almost everything expects some decision from you.    Graphics are very stylish and they look really good. Just by looking at the screenshots you can tell that this is a game with a fantastic world that will immerse you 100%.   The price is completely worth is without a doubt. You can easily expect 100-110 hours of gameplay from D:OS2.  In my opinion, if you like the genre of RPG at all, don't even hesitate to buy this game. This is a RPG masterpiece. "

I was, unfortunately, born too late to see Baldur's Gate 2 in all its glory when it first released, and by the time I did play the game, it had already felt extremely dated, and even still held a certain magic to its world.  Even though DOS:2 does not hold that same kind of magic, it has its own special moments while feeling like a modern game. The world has absorbed me, the characters have enraptured me and I think on an overall, this is one of the few games in which your choices actually matter.  Plus the price isn't your traditonal 60$, while still feeling like a bigger game than most 60$ games these days.  So yeah, if you're into RPGs, wonderful worlds and fun characters... Buy it."

frozen north,40,1,0,"December 8, 2017",Recommended,113.4,"Holy crap. This game is amazing.  So heres the run down. This game is in effect a massive game of dungeons and dragons, only the game is the dungeon master rather then your friend being the dungeon master.   The RPG aspects all feel really nicely done here, with concious effort being required to decide on how best to talk your way through a situation. The fact that every character in the game comes with voice acting is simply astounding, esspecially given just how many characters there are in this game.  As far as combat is concerned, its very similar to XCOM and atlas reactor. Each character recieves a turn, with the order being determind by each characters initiave stat. Much like XCOM and atlas reactor, every action has to have its strength and weaknesses weighted against the situation. To be completely honest, the combat system feels so smooth and effective, it makes the non-combat sections feel underwhelming as a result, and believe me, they definetly are not boring.  The multiplayer aspects are really nice. Personally, I recommend only playing multiplayer with friends, but that has more to do with ensuring cooperation then anything else. One nice feature of playing with friends is that it makes every moment feel more enjoyable.  All that said, I do have a few nitpicks about this game. The ingame market system can feel annoying at times, since only one person can foot the bill for an order of gear. Similarly, there will be many occasions where you can find yourself running through the same dialog again and again in hopes of achieving the best result.  However, despite everything else I have said, the single best thing about this game is its customizability. Built into the game is an editor that allows you to alter the map, the story, and where all enemies are located, which gives the game huge replay value. On top of that, the game is perfectly capable of accepting mods, which cranks this games replay value up to eleven.  Summary: Pros: + Absolutely amazing combat system that feels very familiar to anyone who has played XCOM. + Amazing graphics quality. + Insanely rich story and lore. + Dozens of hours per campaign. + Tons of replay value. + All voice acting is well done, and if you can talk to it, it has a voice. + Loot has a heavy ammount of RNG attached to it. + Everything is right there after you download the game (an increasingly rare thing these days). + Your starting class is completely flexible, and you can change just about everything about your starting class. + You do not need to stick to a specific class as the game goes on, allowing you to adapt as you go. + A ton of workshop content, and the games less then four months old.  Cons: - Things can get a little tedious at times, particularly if your not the best at keeping your saves up to date. - Purchasing from vendors is a little annoying, and I personally feel it could stand some more quality of life features. - You may find yourself restarting fights often as you realize what actually is happening.  Conclusions: Divinity original sin 2 is simply an amazing game. Almost everything about this game screams of quality, and feels like it is the result of honest game design. When people say this is a top of the line RPG game, they are not kidding. With extreme ease of modding, and a still growing community, its easy to see why this game is being called game of the year material.  Score: 9.9/10"

It has all the elements to be a rewarding game with satisfying game playability (i.e., you can play it in so many different ways you never get bored).

Thanosphophyllite,250,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,166.7,"TL;DR: Every minute spent playing the game is an absolute blast and definitely worth every penny.  The very strong points of this game are the amazing versatility of the spells and combat mechanic, making you feel like you can actually come up with a sensible strategy to beat certain fights instead of just ramming into the beef fest head first. Unless you're playing a lone wolf pure warrior, in which case these two concepts meet one another. The ""puddle"" mechanic is intuitive and very fun to experiment with, for example making it rain upon your foes before striking them with lightning and finishing them off by turning them into a pile of frozen electrified flesh.  The only problem you'll encounter is that you need to make your own replayability of the game in the form of changing playstyle, class or upping the difficulty as the content is nearly always the same.  A few bugs here and there towards the end of the game but nothing major, it's mostly just spells unslotting themselves if you reorganize them a bit too fast and the such.  The soundtrack is the perfect balance of soothing and tense, keeping you on your feet yet feeling like you're playing a D&D session with friends, great fantasy RPG feel. The voice acting is pretty good too even if you do get these moments YARROW GIRL! You. It is you. I have found you. Vermin. What's this? I found something!  A very solid game to play alone for a RPG feel or with friends for a great love/hate relationship that the main quest helps you build up and even actively encourages during certain parts of the game, much like the coop of Portal 2!"

I played the game with one character to the end of the first Act and all of the fights were very challenging and entertaining. The only complaint I have at this point is the crafting system, which still seems very cryptic. I presume it will be improved for the final release, but as it stands, I was only able to craft some arrows and potions. The recipes and books I found were all restricted to arrows, potions, and some cooking stuff (the cooking stuff seemed pretty useless up to now). Apart from that, the game looks and plays beautifully. The history is pretty interesting as well and keeps you immersed and hooked for what's coming next. I actually felt a bit sad after beating Act 1 because I want to play the rest of the game so bad, but I know I'll have to wait at least a month until it gets released. In conclusion, if you played DOS1, you have to play this game.

Echo466,65,1,0,March 14,Recommended,79.5,"So there are many things you should know about Divinity Original Sin II before you buy it.                                                                - Time and Dedication -    1: This game is a massive timesink. You have to invest into this wonderful gem of a game in order to take appreciation for what it is. If you are unable to put in 100+ Hours? Probably dont buy this game. I am currently forty hours into this game and I feel like I am just beginning to scratch the surface.                                                                 - Patience and Understanding -    2: This game is quite punishing and can be frustrating when you lose to the same group of enemies 5-6 times just because you are outnumbered 2/1. But knowing HOW to approach a battle and WHERE is key and if you do it wrong? There is a good chance a relatively easy battle will be much more difficult from such a simple miscalculation. Now this game is not nearly as unforgiving as its original predecessor? But it is still punishing.                                                                 - Things I like -    A: The story. It does a MUCH better job of gripping you this time and actually keeps the player actively engadged with what is going on, and if you played the first one? You know exactly how dry the first one was.     B:  Combat is relatively the same but minor changes here and there, positional awareness and planning are key.     C:  This is a wonderful multiplayer title, I can not even bring to mind one that challenged this in terms of just raw playability and fun. IF you have a friend or two that can play this with you the entire game? It enhances the gameplay by leagues. This game was made to be played with friends.                                                               - Things I dont like -     A: It has strayed away from D&D mechanics a bit more than the first one? But that is okay. It makes it more accessible for other players that arent interested in this.                                                                 *This is a big one*    B: The introduction of magic and physical armor to every piece of armor and apparel. Now normally this is fine? But the way it works now? The physical and magic armor acts as a buffer to the characters health. They have 1000 Physical armor? Your Barb wont be able to touch him for most of the fight as attacks will only hit the physical armor portion of his health. They have 1000 magic armor? Well your mage is now out as magic will not be able to inflict and damage to their health until their magic armor is depleted. In addition each of these respective new ""stats"", they also act as a shield against status effects completely while active. Cannot burn someone with magic armor, cannot cripple someone with physical armor, cannot blind someone with magic armor. This system feels absolute and a bit broken because if you have enough of both? You are immune to damage and status effects for that stat type until the armor depletes.      C: It can still be quite easy to lose yourself in what is going on. I have to constantly be re-reading through my journal to make sure I know what I need to do. If you spend a week or two away? Expect to sit there and decipher the journal until you have retraced your steps enough to know where and what you need to do.    Anyways.. This game is amazing. I love it and highly reccommend it if you have the time to put into it and of course a friend or two to play with. If you are on the fence about this? Dont be. Get it."

empiu,267,1,0,"November 13, 2017",Recommended,248.0,"So, I finished the game. What can I say to those, who came to read the reviews, thinking about buying this game? I think I'll use default pros/cons list of things doesn't mentioned on the game page:  +  Content/price ratio. It will probably took you about 80~100 hours just to complete campaign. Can be more, can be less.  +  Great feeling of adventure, even the main quest line feels more like an exploration rather than just following the markers on the map (hello to Skyrim main quest).  +  Neat battle mechanics. And again, it's not a straight line of pushing the buttons to deal damage (hello to Dragon Age combat). You can explore the possibilities of different spells effects, you must check resistances of your enemies, you should care about positioning your heroes and seeking good spell combos (at least on high difficulty settings).  + Good storyline (highly subjective opinion). Some nice twists (one final twist actually can be predicted long before it's happening by watching closely on a particular NPC characteristics, which is nice), characters with different stories (both past and ongoing).   - Despite the story being good (highly subjective opinion), I didn't find characters catchy or very interesting. I would rate them as ""okay, I guess"". None of them, I don‚Äôt know, touched my heart and made me worry about him/her. I guess it's because they rarely showing their personalities through some sort of a tete-a-tete dialogues with your hero and very limited interaction between party members.  -  Bugs. Few in singleplayer (mostly side quests that can't be finished properly and incorrect dialogue sequences, nothing critical, but still it is an unpleasant experience) and a lot in co-op mode (you can find lists of current issues on reddit if you really want, it's constantly changes because old bugs being fixed and new being discovered). Developers fixing them and rolling patches very often, but I think the game without a publisher demanding the product here and now should be polished better on its release.  - When I selected ""tactician"" difficulty, because default level was too easy and then I find that the ‚Äútactician‚Äù is easy too, I couldn't go higher because ""tactician"" doesn't allow changing the game difficulty. WTH?  - Patches are breaking localization. I played the game in Russian, but after some patches some spells began to use English names and some entries in the quest log changed the language.  -  And lastly, I want to mention the dark side of highly variable combat. Huge possibilities mean huge exploits and when battle was too hard for me, rather than winning because I learned something from my mistakes and improved tactics I usually won because I've found a way to cheat the game.  Major ""cheat source"" is stealth mode and NPCs reaction to it. In most cases, if all party members are Solid Snaking, they will just stay in one place obediently skipping their turns and waiting when you decide to show yourself. Only if combat can be finished without killing all enemies (I think this is how it works) they can start walking and searching for you like the source puppets from the last part of the game.  In the end despite all cons I've found this game really fun to play and rate it 8/10 spooky scary skeletons with buckets on their heads, totally recommend."

Ballistic Drop,92,1,0,"November 20, 2017",Recommended,42.4,"I have been looking for an ""old school"" RPG for a long time along the lines of Baldur's Gate.   This game reminds me of what I fondly remember those games to be. The games I used to play weren't as good as this, so I must be getting senile in my dotage.   Pro:  Character Creation. This is the first time I really wanted to play a non-human character. In older games you would get the same old Tolkien-esque non humans to choose from that in the end were just humans with different stat caps. The non-human characters in Divinity 2 actually give a whole other way to roleplay your campaign; from special abilities that shall we say, might be a little too gastronomically challenging for squeamish players to ones that add a delightfully morbid sense of humor to the game. Time to break out of our ""humans only"" team leader habits.  Tutorial. The first third (or so) of the game can be considered a tutorial for how to maximize your party's effectiveness. Much better than simply throwing you in a training room and showing the basic button clicks to make a fight happen.  Graphics/Art. I'm usually not overly concerned with every game having absolutely jaw dropping graphics to be entertaining. That being said, Divinity 2 is gorgeous. The attention to artistic detail has led me to walk into more than one trap while admiring the art on the walls.  Story. I'm not going to go into a great level of detail here, I want you to discover the story yourself. What you get however manages to balance what we expect from a fantasy RPG while adding new elements that keep you guessing whether you really are the hero or not.   Side Quests. Plenty to do there to take up all of your free time. One feature I really enjoyed is that there isn't always a good solution, and that solution might have repercussions down the road you did not expect. No Mass Effect Paragon system here folks.  Cons:   Learning curve. After the tutorial adventure the difficulty can seem to ramp up very quickly, I found this to be primarily due to the sheer amount of customizability you have available to you. Be patient, save often.  Pathing. Sometimes your party does not like you and wants to go sightseeing when you are clicking on the next objective. Keep an eye on where they are going.   Divinity 2 is a fantastic game that shows you don't have to go to the AAA publishers to have a memorable experience. Give it a try and gnaw on a couple of dismembered arms for me. "

The only downside is the limitations of useable content when creating campaigns with the GM mode, most of it can be accesed via mods but I don't understand why this stuff wasn't accesible in the first place. Larian have been pretty good with the updates and they take all feedback on their forums so this game will only be getting better from here on."
kira_elf,19,1,0,"December 18, 2017",Recommended,133.7,"I really like this game, I haven't played the 1st one, but Original Sin 2 is really fun. I like that you can choose whatever start class, and then switch in mid game and use some of the points just to get the one skill that you want to use.  The main downside of the game is the quest browser. It's quite difficult to keep track of all the quest (even more if you are playing with 3 other friends in your party) and you cannot even search for name of quests or npcs that gave you the quest, so either you remember everything, or you get lost among all the quest.  Still I would recommend it to everyone who likes rpgs, the transition between the normal game and the fights (that are turn based) is really good."
Jack Bright,251,1,3,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,120.3,"So I woke up on a boat in a bunch of rags tied to a table and realized this isn't my usual state of affairs, and I was on a boat to auschwitz but for cool people. I met some elf lady and she was carving names into her arm like an edgelord and was like ""yeah I can read memories by eating people"" and I said ""No ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing way"" and she's like ""Lemme lick your arm I'll prove it."" So I gave her my SKELETON ARM, because I decided my character would be 2spooky for this world, and she was just like ""lol whatever"" and did it anyway. Turns out she was telling the truth. Neat.  Then some stinky red lizard looked at my teeth and said I would be a bad slave becuase I can't cook. Shortly after that some old woman blew the boat up because she's got a touch of the dementia.  I woke up in a concentration camp for wizards and then I murdered people extorting a woman for protection money, and then she took me into a cave and a small child asked me to play hide and seek so I did and then he showed me a secret door and I went inside and he introduced me to an old giant skeleton and the old skeleton told me about a secret passage next to a statue. So I went that way and I found that elf chick that licked me spying on a stinky lizard and she was like  'Nobody gets the drop on me, I should just kill you.' And I was like ""Okay but what if"" ""You didn't"" And she was like 'You know that's a pretty good point lets go kill the stinky lizard' And then we did.  Turns out some smelly lizard enslaved her and she's on a grand revenge quest and the names in her arm are who he made her kill so she doesn't forget what he did, and on her other arm its the people she's going after. I wasn't sure if it was edgy or badass so I decided ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•it lets just go.  Also apparently I'm the second coming or something, so that's cool. But there's like six other people who are also the second coming and there can only be one in this scotland. Speaking of, one of them is the elf that's helping me, Sebille or some‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Anyway...  Anyway, then I went through the passage and I ended up in the KKK's basement, but I couldn't figure out how to get out, so I killed some teleporting crocodiles and just kicked the front door in before murdering EVERYONE, then went back into the basement and then I killed their flesh stitcher and then I ran into the swamp and fought a skeleton that made illusions so I could get a wand that eats magic and then I used it to kill the grand wizard.  To be more specific I used it to bypass a bunch of screaming jesuses that shot lightning at you , then summoned a giant worm because I tried to fix my armor, and then murdered the pope and his teleporting gimp sidekicks (but not really because he had an extra life in his backpack)  Anyway, after that I stole a talking boat by convincing the door to the captains quarters that in order to answer the security question to recover the password I had to know the password, so it told me and then realized that it was dumbtarded. That's how I showed up in Driftwood. I got told ""YOU NEED TO BE A BETTER WIZARD. I went snooping about for leads. Which led to...

That really didn't help me be a better messiah, so I found people that were already good at being a sourcerer. One was some slimy undead dwarf that was stealing nerve gas and generally being an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, and after I beat him up we had the following exchange.  ""TELL ME HOW TO BE JEEEEEEEEESUS"" 'lmao no' ""Mang I'll ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing kill you don't be a‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•quot; 'okay holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•just eat this space lobster heart and leave me alone' And then I ate the space lobster heart and got superpowered. It was pretty cool, but I needed INFORMATION. ""What were you stealing"" 'It may or may not have been nerve gas' ""Who did you give it to?"" 'I cant tell you that he'll kill me' Then I slapped him with my pimp hammer and he tried to tell me but then he exploded. Weird.  Anyway I asked some demon possessed lizardman to give me more magic and he just did it for free, demons are pretty cool like that. Well, mostly free, he just wanted me to kill some cultists I would have done anyway, so that's pretty good. He told me where to go, and I went for the place with a really unimaginative name where I'm supposed to jump in a lake and become the new god king or something like that.  Got there and Sebille was like ""Hey you know that ugly lizard that enslaved me and made me kill a bunch of people? He's there."" and I was all 'oh‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•m80 what are we gonna do' And she said ""Look dude you're actually a pretty cool guy (‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• yeah I am) and you've really been a huge help to me and I feel like I can trust you, because you've literally been solving the worlds problems left and right (You're god damn right I am) so I'm gonna teach you how to use my slave scar he gave me to stop him from instantly mind‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•me by proximity"" So she did and then we hugged and stuff and it was really weird because she said I have soft hands and I think she forgot I'm a skeleton.  Anyway then we landed on the island and the pope was there and he told us to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing murder everyone else so we did because, well, they were‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Also killed that stupid lizard that enslaved my comrade. She was pretty hyped about that.  We get to the door to the god-making kiddie pool and she says ""Hey, you can be god. I really think you'd be better at it than me, since you're such a hero.""  Which is great because I actually kinda like this chick and didn't feel like smashing her... with my hammer.  Anyway all the other casuals were there and they were like ""WE GOT KILLED BECAUSE OF YOU BUT THE GLORY OF SATAN BROUGHT US BACK TO LIFE AND WE'RE GONNA ERASE THE WORLD LIKE IN UNDERTALE.""  To which I replied ""that's pretty gay"" and beat them all to death again. But right as I was about to become the god emperor...  Some edgy ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• resurrected Ganondorf to teach her how to kill all the magic so he gave her an ancient Shamwow that sucks up magic instead of liquids and then she cucked me out of godhood and killed the pope by using her magic dishrag to‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•all the power out of the divinity granting tanning bed and ran away like a‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• but ganondorf is getting out of his bondage leash and murdering ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•es when edgelord isn't looking so he can be the new hokage.  We got back on the boat to go chase edgelord down. En route I smashed Sebille with my 'hammer.' 4 times. Bonezone counter: 6.  Now I'm in the capitol and trying to stop them from finding jesus's corpse and stealing his stand power so they can ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• the entire world over by removing everyone's source and thereby turning them into Stephen hawking if he was also ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.  10/10 best game."
Holon,57,1,0,"October 9, 2017",Recommended,252.6,"I am over 200 hours into the game now. And I can say by now, this is my personal game of the year 2017. It's brilliant. It's a great coop game as well as a great solo game.   I would have to write several pages to review why this game is good. But I'll try to keep it very short:  + Full voiced over  + Entertaining NPC talks with a lot of laughs you get from it  + Interesting and often suprising story, that will change in the details, when you play another character build.  + By far the best turn based combat system I have ever seen in a game. I usually hate turn based fights, because it often feels like playing chess. This game does it so much better. Just go on youtube and watch some videos on fights. You will see how nice it is designed.  + A pretty intelligent and challenging AI that makes combat really hard and strategic if you like.  + Beautiful graphics. The world looks amazing.  + Beautiful music / soundtrack  + Very good level design. When you enter the world, you want to explore it, and you can get lost in it in a positive way.  + Perfect coop implementation. You can join a friend's game at any time and take control over one of his companions. Or you start together and create your own characters.  + The skill system is pretty huge and you have a lot of customisation options.  I really try to balance this review and tell you good and bad things about this game. But I have hard times to find any bad. This game is just so bloody good. But here aare things, I would like to see improved. They are highlevel critic on an almost perfect game:  - The quests in this game are recorded in some kind of diary. I like that kind of questlog, but it needs more information added to it: It doesn't tell you what level that quest is for, which is kind of a problem, as you have quests ranging over 6 and more levels in a region. I started to explore a region but didn't do every quest I got right away. So when I started to solve quests later on, I ran into a lot of enemies that were 2 or 3 levels higher than my group. In this game such a difference in level often means you don't stand a chance, especially on higher difficulty. So I would like to see a level written to each quest in the diary. At the moment you pretty much have to finish quests as you get them, which makes it a bit of a linear experience. I would like to be more flexible.  - Also the log doesn't tell you where you got a quest and not all of them get pinned on your map. So it's really hard to remember all the locations, which could also be improved.  It's very hard to review this game, because it has so many aspects. The world of DOS2 is full of things you can discover, I got a lot of laughs out of the dialogs and I like the story. The story also really surprised me at times, you can't predict how it will go and in the details it will be different depending on what character you play. Which is brilliant and gives this game so much replayabillity. I am in act 2 at the moment and I am almost 200 hours into the game. This game is vast... it's just huge. You get so much content, I didn't expect this game to be that big.  I love this game to be honnest. It's probably the best RPG I ever played in over 10 years.  So, there you are, this game is worth every penny. Great Story, amazing voice over, great combat, great RPG, great graphics.... what else? I love it."

Plank,219,1,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,89.1,"Divinity Is honestly one of the best games I have came to play since The Witcher 3. Every single quest feels like it has purpose to it, I really enjoy the combat (even if it can be a little cheap with the stuns sometimes) and the story is amazing. The Devs seem to really care about making a good game, and honestly the only bad reviews i've seen so far have been people raging about how to min-max their characters. Besides that, this game should have Extreamly posative reviews!"
Don,332,1,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,187.0,"It's hard to find games like this anymore.  The care they put into it shows, it comes packed full of content, you can easily get hundreds of hours of gameplay out of it; the story is extremely rich and really long, and the turn based combat is fun, interactive and also challenging. If you like tactical turn based combat I recommend you choose Tactician mode, it will make you earn every combat you start. Enemies will not respawn in this game and there is a finite amount of experience you can get, which is good because it saves you from having to grind to level up.  The music is really good too, it gives the game its personal touch and adds a lot to combat and exploration.   The gameplay is a callback to the classic RPGs era: isometric camera, point and click movement, multitude of meaningful different dialogue choices and choices in general, a strong emphasis on exploration to find secret caches and treasure, and a quest system that will not hold your hands. This game rewards you for being attentive and reading, more often than not you will not get clear quest markers that show you exactly where you need to go and what you need to do, you'll have to figure it out by yourself. The same goes for puzzles.  The world building is great, you will feel very inmersed into the lore, the characters and the world you're exploring. The world you play through is divided in 4 giant maps that you will access sequentially, however, you can freely explore and do things in the order you prefer within each one of these maps.  The writing and voice-over is also excellent, although sometimes a bit cheesy, but it's clear that most of the times it was intentional. The story is a lot more mature and dark than the first original sin's. Humor is nice. I recommend you take the Pet Pal talent with at least one of your characters, the dialogue with animals is just too good, sometimes hilarious and other times depressing.  As for difficulty, you have 4 options: explorer, classic, tactician and honor, which are easy mode, normal mode, hard mode and hardcore, respectively. Honor mode will delete your save if your entire party dies so you have to start over from the beginning, definitely not recommended for your first playthrough. Tactician is challenging at first and it will make you sweat each and every victory, but it's also really rewarding, and once you get the hang on the game's mechanics it will feel a lot more natural and accessible. Classic is still challenging especially if it's the first time you play the game, but enemies will have less health and armor, and the AI will be more prone to making tactically inefficient decisions to give the player some more room for mistakes. Explorer is the difficulty for people who just care about the story and want to breeze through the combat as quickly as possible.  And finally, multiplayer and extra features. Coop is a blast, playing a campaign with a friend is great. Up to 4 people can play together. the game adapts perfectly to multiple people playing the same campaign except for one thing: the dialogue. Only the person who starts a conversation with a NPC gets to choose the dialogue options, which honestly can be a little frustrating when you and your friends don't agree with something, but otherwise everything else is perfect. The game also features a GM mode where you can create and edit your very own campaign, and then share it with everybody else. I can't talk too much about this feature though because I have only checked it out real quick, it looks very complex and the editor seems like it gives the user a lot of tools, so all I can say is that the potential is there.   Overall, I won't be surprised if this game becomes a classic and we start seeing a lot of new CRPGs being born thanks to it. The developers have earned this success, and this is a 100% recommended purchase for every lover of the genre, and also for people looking for a great time even if they're not very keen on the genre."

ateo.ars,226,1,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,57.4,"This is a great game, but you need to be aware of a few very frustrating game mechanics. You will be thrown into battle with enemies who, even if they are your level, will have far better spells/skills/abilities at their disposal and will almost always have far better field position than you do to start the battle(even if you attempt to position your forces prior to starting the encounter). You will also frequently be outnumbered even if you have a full party and you will probably die horribly if you take on any group that's above your level. If you're a fan of loot pinatas, you will be disappointed. You will fight and win very challenging batlles where the odds are stacked against you only to loot bodies that are mostly empty or have junk loot. You will be frustrated and rage-quit if you don't approach every battle with caution and aren't prepared to cheese your way through fights, when needed. The game is still rewarding despite these things, but it is not a simple hack-n-slash RPG."

dominoblox,58,1,0,"November 9, 2017",Recommended,97.2,"If you are a fan of games like Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, and other RPGs games based on heavily entrenched lore, you will most assuredly love this game. It's polished, has a lot of history attached to the world, and every character feels important in some way or another. On top of that, every tiny thing I move or interact with feels like it has changed my game for the good or for the bad.  Pros: -On my brand new Alienware desktop, the game looks pretty dang good. There are a few issues I can mention, but it would only be me nipicking. I'm not a huge stickler for graphics anway.  -Everything feels ALIVE and like I am just a tiny part of a huge world. -The combat feels fluid and well-refined. -The story is enthralling. Cons: -The combat, though fluid, has a few issues. The first is that there is a great deal of metagaming that takes me out of the world. On many occassions, I found a battle completely impossible until I restarted the game, positioned my characters around the future battlefield for an advantage, and then triggered the battle. It feels like I'm cheating, and I don't like that! -I know it's for space, but I'd like to have an option to have a free roaming world where I can travel between islands. Once you're done with a location, it locks you out!  Other than that, this game is splendidly done and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story. :)"

Lima,402,1,0,May 6,Recommended,92.0,"In short, one of the best games to buy if you are looking to spend some time with friends, in a co-op adventure. If that is what you are looking for, I highly suggest to just buy it, and not read the reviews.  What is there that others haven't already said? The game scores extremely high on both professional and user reviews.  The way you build your character, roleplay him/her and interact with your companions, creates a unique and memorable story. The game is full of life, an interesting story, amazing gameplay mechanics (seriously, I sometimes couldn't stop thinking about ways to build my character, since you can literally do any build that you want. I ended up as the summoner, healer, buffer, croud controller of my party the first time we played, with six hotbars).  A friend of mine told me that a game is worth its price if 1‚Ç¨ (or whatever currency you have) equals to 1 hour of gameplay, and we passed that mark a long time ago. Definitely worth your money and time for a great experience.  I'm excited to see their next game :)"

Mumen Rider,106,1,0,"December 29, 2017",Recommended,91.0,"When I started reading reviews calling this ""the greatest RPG ever made,"" and even ""the greatest GAME ever made,"" I had to  try it. The reviews reminded me a lot of The Witcher 3 and it was for the same reason that I bought and played that game way back when and it's now considered my favorite game of all time. So yeah, I got a little excited.  Then I played the game and I felt kind of disappointed. It seemed extremely difficult and I wasn't used to getting the cold shoulder from a game. By that I mean compared to most games this one does not hold your hand, you won't get arrows pointing you in the direction you need to go, everything you need to know is actually in the dialogue and/or read in notes and books (and sometimes a rare hint from the narrator). I kept feeling confused on where to go and who to talk to and the quest system seemed kind of clunky and hard to understand at first.  I'm ashamed to admit, I asked for a refund at about the hour and a half mark. Then I went a couple days thinking about the game and that I couldn't believe I couldn't get into it. And then I thought about it again and again and realized that something was nagging at me and I couldn't stop thinking about it.  So yeah... I bought the game again. I looked up tips this time around on which characters people like in their party and which skills really help early game (Lone Wolf changed everything for me). And most of all I had to learn to slow down, stop running through rooms like nothing matters. This game made me change the way I approach video games. I started to appreciate the detail and get into the story, and I have to say, the story is absolutely amazing. The characters are all interesting and the situations I found myself in during certain points in dialogue had me on the edge of my seat.  Now I'm 40 hours in and I can confirm, absolutely one of the greatest RPGs ever. And I haven't even had the pleasure to experience co-op with a friend. 10/10"

Jon Rando,341,1,0,"December 4, 2017",Recommended,148.9,"Wow, this game is just a breath of fresh air in an age of sequels and recycled gameplay.  I've been playing through this almost exclusively co-op with a few friends and it has just been one of the best co-op experiences I've had in a long time.  I can‚Äôt really think of a comparable quality story driven, co-op RPG on PC since maybe Neverwinter Nights and that is 15 years old.  I really like the fact that everyone is free to run around and do their own thing and have their own conversations without generally locking the party into cutscenes or anything like that.  You can choose to follow your companions around and listen in on them, or you can split up and report back what you've heard in your own conversations.  Not having control of your character usurped every 5 minutes for an unskippable cutscene is quite nice.  Over the last few years, I‚Äôve played some Dungeons & Dragons on Roll20, Skype or Tabletop Simulator.  Playing through this game feels very much like the D&D experience, even borrowing many of the mechanics like passive perception and attacks of opportunity.  Both in and out of combat, the game gets a lot right in this regard and really shines as a result.  And speaking of the tactical turn-based combat, it is really great.  I‚Äôve mostly played it co-op with friends, but I played the first little bit single player as well.  Either way you go it is very fun, and can be quite challenging at times if you get in over your head.  And you can‚Äôt just eat a lot of deaths either because your resurrection options are limited, at least early on.  A lot of the combat revolves around elemental mechanics similar to that of Magicka.  So for example you can spill oil on the ground, ignite it with fire, put the fire out with some water thus turning the water into steam and then you could shock the steam cloud and make it electrified.  This makes for interesting situations in combat and there are often unintended side effects if you are not careful.  The combat AI of the opponents seems passable enough.  I have seen them do some pretty questionable things at times though.  In particular, during one fight we had an enemy archer spend 2 or 3 turns shooting arrows into a barricade because it didn‚Äôt have a clear shot at our rogue.  There have also been a few other instances where they would take actions which seemed to benefit our side more than theirs.  We‚Äôve only played on the ‚Äòclassic‚Äô normal difficulty though so I can‚Äôt really comment on the higher difficulties.  The controls can also be a bit tricky at times, leading you to accidentally move when you intended to use an ability or vice versa.  But this mostly just comes down to being patient and paying attention to what you are doing.  If you try to do things too fast before the animations finish it can mess you up.  Also the game won‚Äôt tell you if your ranged attack (bow/wand/staff/etc) will hit something in the environment so you just need to be aware of things.  Although I‚Äôve somewhat taken a back seat in the story development process in our play through, the fact that all the interactions with NPC‚Äôs are voice acted really helps.  And while every side quest isn‚Äôt Witcher 3 levels of amazing, I haven‚Äôt had any complaints.  You can even take a perk and talk to the animals if you want to be just a little be more depressed along the way.  All in all I have been thoroughly enjoying this game and would gladly buy an expansion or another sequel in this series.  I look forward to future releases from Larian Studios and hope they can continue to provide truly phenomenal games without all the shady modern business practices like endless microtransactions and loot crates."

This game has exceeded my expectations so far, through it's story, the characters thus far, and how they expanded the classes and added to the combat system.  The changes/additions to combat is what I have been happy with most.  Of course the music is great.  The voice acting is not the best, but it is still enjoyable."

I've been playing RPG's since Darkstone on PS1, and I have to say this is my favorite. It's complex, the characters matter to you, and every time I think that I'm a god that can't be stopped, DO2 puts me in my place.  I finished the game but I still cant believe its over. My party is done and went on to do amazing things. I'm going to start a new game, with a new party, but I'll always have my memory of my first adventure with DO2. God I'm excited to begin a new story.   This game is a home-run. The gameplay takes a little bit, but getting your own personal strategy down is wonderfully rewarding.

MooCows,416,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,77.0,"I'm sure by now you've seen many reviews raving about the pros of this game (and there are many pros). So rather than rehash everything that's fantastic, I'll keep this review brief by listing my few quibbles with the experience.  1) Misclicks: I've had a number of irritating cases of accidentally clicking on something I didn't intend to. Outside of combat this generally means I accidentally stole something because the vendor I tried to click on moved. It would be great if there were a ""don't steal crap"" option to avoid this. In combat it usually happens when I try to attack an enemy and click terrain instead because their model isn't static, resulting in wasted AP at best, and being on the receiving end of attacks of opportunity at worst.  2) Companions: The only complaint I have here is that they seldom seem to react to your choices and actions outside of direct conversations with them. So far it's seemed too easy to keep all of my dramatically different companions happy as clams - even two who would or should be trying to kill each other in their sleep.  3) Co-op: Sort of a pro and con... Your online experience may vary. The game puts no real restrictions on the behavior of other players in your game. There are a lot of ways they can help or hinder you (including betraying you in the middle of a battle). So, like with traditional pen & paper games, the people you're playing with determine whether or not you will get any enjoyment out of it.  If none of those serve as a major deterrent for you, then you are going to greatly enjoy this game. I honestly can't recommend it enough to RPG fans. I've enjoyed all forty hours that I've put into this game at the time of this review, and I feel like I've barely scratched the game's surface."

If D+D, Diablo 2, and Elder scrolls had a three way and some how all became the parents, this is the love child that no one will ever not love,  The only phase that comes to mind with this game is ""Sh\t, you can do that?"" Run out of lockpicks? Pick up some nails, use a hammer on them. BOOM now you have lockpicks. Keep slipping on ice? Well if you havent used all the nails up on making lockpicks, put them on your boots. BOOM, slip proof boots.  Someone really‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•you off? Turn them into a chicken. Need a temparary sheild? Drop a painting in front of yourself. Cant get round a door? Either use force and brake it down, or play it smart and teleport around it.  The list goes on. I honestly cant wait for my second play through to see what i missed. And then my third play through to see what i can do better.   Before this, ive never truly enjoyed a game. This is almost perfect.  Couple of little buggy bits, like party members not joining a fight for some reason, so i have to make them take 2 step forward to make them join in.

They opened the unique experience window based on the race you choose. They provided extremely original options to mask your character and alter their NPC treatment mid playthrough, and continued the tradition of allowing an unlimited number of ways to complete a quest. I'm about 70 hours in, and feel like I've hardly scraped the surface. I've yet to even try the DM or multiplayer modes.

memopek,409,1,0,January 6,Recommended,152.2,"+ Co-op All the game!  + Good dialogues. They are all voice acted and well written. It does not bore you to hell to listen to people. Some talking options are sometimes a little vague but it's water under the bridge.  + A Good story Not like it's an emotional tale, but the game takes the extra effort to give you actual characters with backgrounds and sets you in a cool world, built neatly.   + Cool Combat Turn based combat has its downsides but this is one of the games where it is fun. You have a nice variety of useful skills and combat options. Also you can build your characters as flexible as possible and respec them if you want.  + Tons of Content You have all these different routes and dialogue choices to explore throughout the game, which is a heaven and a nightmare because you feel lost in it and have to sink your 150 hours into the game.  + The Art It looks and sounds good.    This would be the best game ever if it was not for a series of intersected problems. They're not so bad themselves but together these problems make me think twice if i want to play the game.  - Entering the combat in a wrong way. If you did not get a good headstart and hit your enemies before entering the turn-based combat or get your characters in the right positions, you might as well as load. Most of the time you're the underdog (even more with higher difficulty) and have a power/stat disadvantage. They could've at least give the player half a turn to move, not even to attack.  - Random Encounters Entering the combat feels a little clunky, but what makes it worse is that you won't know when you'll be entering the combat. Were you talking to someone? They turned hostile. Were you exploring a cave? You were ambushed by high level monsters. They are fun and interesting when they are sparse but turn out to be a hassle if you come across them in a row and go into a dozen of long/difficult fights. This game needs more fights where you can actually plan before going in.  - Turn-based combat takes time Who knew you'd have to wait your turn right? You wait for AI to think. You wait for the animations to happen. You wait for your co-op mates. You miss your turn if you get stunned. So if you walked into a random encounter, or get defeated in a fight and want to try again, you will sit there for a while.  - Loading screens take time I admit this might be on my end because my hard disk is getting old. But i can still tell the game is hard on my hard disk. When i get into combat, i always find myself having to decide whether to load right there to get a better headstart or wait to see if i can somehow pull through, learn the fight then try again. So I end up waiting for something. The need to load often does not help."

vermouth,56,1,0,January 6,Recommended,117.9,"Just finished the first play-through on tactician difficulty... still sinking in at what was said at the ending and ponder the strange feeling I have now that my adventure has come to a close. This game has the most intriguing, twisting, imaginative, and board-sighted story line. In my first play through, because apparantly I have built my character so strong that I defeated the final final boss with the click of two bottons (though involveing some tricks), the combat has not been the actual high lights. It was the stories that kept me hooked. I never knew where it would take me, never knew what's the truth of this world that I am in, the relationship I can develop with my partners, the images I could fill in with my imaginations to paint the world as what I want it to become... It is just a shame that this has to be only a game, not a real universe; the ending had come too fast: where my own imagination truly ran wild and where the game presents what should be the most remembered part of the story, it just felt that it ended very quickly. But this is no complaint of the game, endings like this had me recalling every past moment of my adventures and together the ending actually painted a very big picture, but it was just so good that I can't help but want more!!!!! I could honestly play the ending over and over and over again!!!!  If you decide to play, my best advise would be to paint a picture of the world while you advance through the stories. With every conversation, quest, discovery of secrets, encounters, the picture would become a little bit clearer. Through this you can capture the true beauty of this game! I just hoped that I didn't have to realize this until the ending and had to take it all in at once :)"
Gilmez,113,1,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,217.3,"THE STORY: This is by far the most densely rich lore I‚Äôve played through from any game I‚Äôve played, where almost everyone and everything is connected in one way or another. Creating a living and breathing world, where one‚Äôs actions and decisions will affect their adventures through Rivellon. The part where this game shines the most, is how it gives the player choices on how they want to advance the story in any way the player chooses to play. Choose to be good, evil, just or whatever mood you choose, this game adapts to it and guides you to the end that your choices led to. While I‚Äôve only completed Fane‚Äôs Story (in the moment of writing this), the endings it gives you will satisfy however you played. While you can choose how your adventure ends, the game lets you know how those actions will affect Rivellon in the future. The reason why I love this story is how grim and real this story plays out, no one is truly good or evil, it‚Äôs all a grey area, but it‚Äôs your choice on how you want to navigate in it.  THE COMBAT: There was never a dull moment every time I went into battle, or stumble on to one. While combat is turn-based, pre-battle is when things become interesting. Some approaches I found to be more fun is laying out traps and pre-emptive attacks on unknowing enemies. I can go into combat with my enemies clinging on 5% health and wipe them out with one attack. This is true liberty that this game gives to players, it gives you the tools and it‚Äôs up to you on how to use them. And this is just combat, skills can give a creative twist to combat. You can chain attacks to deliver devastating blows to your enemies or toy around with them by unleashing various Statues Effects and skills that can either immobilize them or transform them into chickens. All this creates a simple yet complex toy box you can play with. Finding out what seems fun and effective will make you want to seek out the next battle and unleash your battle plan.  THE MUSIC: I do not, in any way, have any complaints or criticisms about the music. The only thing I can say is that it is Divine. The music makes Rivellon and in turn makes you believe that it is a real place and these characters who live in it are part of a giant play. The 4 instruments that you can pick (while you build your character) creates the mood in how you want to play and you can change it any time you want.  This is the best RPG for this generation. While there are quite a few bugs the developer needs to fix, this doesn‚Äôt affect how much I love this game. "

E‚ë®id¬Æin,160,1,0,February 7,Recommended,90.9,"We were somewhere around Fort Joy on the edge of the ocean when the source began to take hold. I remember saying something like ""I feel a bit sourcemuted; maybe you should fight..."" And suddenly there was a terrible storm all around us and the sea was full of what looked like huge slugs, all swooping and screeching all around the ship. And a voice was screaming: ""Divine Lucian! What are these goddamn animals?""  The early looting had also given me 300 gold in cash, most of which was already spent on extremely important revival scrolls. Our luggage looked like a mobile junk shop. We had two bags of food, seventy five notes we didn't care to read, five tomes of crafting books, a salt shaker half full of stardust, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored potions, bottles, grenades, spellscrolls and also a quart of healing brew, a pile of intencies, a case of portraits, a bunch of rabbit paws and two dozen golden spoons. Not that we needed all that for escape, but once you get locked into a serious trash collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. The only thing that really worried me was the crafting. There is nothing in the world more helpless and irresponsible and depraved than a man in the depths of a crafting binge. And I knew we'd get into that rotten stuff pretty soon."
Dome Chomsky,78,1,0,"November 2, 2017",Recommended,213.1,"10/10, Larian has done it again  Everything I liked about the enhanced edition (my first title by them) has been kept, and a few things I didn't like have been improved upon.   The combat is really fun, and is developed. You should check out some videos or streams to see if you think you'll like it. I first played on classic but then started a new playthrough on the more challenging mode, Tactician.  The NPCs and voice acting is top notch, and this goes for the generic scholar, trickster voices you can choose for your own player as well. The voice acting for the origin story characters Lohse, The Red Prince, Sebille, Beast and Ifan are amazing as well, there was one part where I nearly cried it was so touching.   If you like RPGs, or especially if you liked Divinity Original Sin, then  get this game, you'll love it.  If you really like a challenge, try the game on honour mode...it is the hardest difficulty, and I'm considering playing through again  P.S for me, time to complete each act:         Act 1: 9 hours, Act 2: 17 hours, Act 3: 6 hours, Act 4: 10 hours  total 42 hours (2nd playthrough technically, original time to complete act 1: 24 hours pre-release) "

Kafungalung,59,1,0,February 10,Recommended,196.7,"Pros: If the developers of this game used the same game engine and style and made a D&D title my life would be complete. As someone who hates turn based games this game is amazing. the graphics and story are captivating, the abilities are satesfying and easy to understand and the game is just great. In addition the game does not cradle you one bit you will find yourself quickly defeated in any fight where you don't play to your party's strengths and avoid their weaknesses. and with turn based combat fighting lots of enemies at once can be a massive challenge forcing you to eaither set up traps or pick them of a few at a time. I spent over 150 hours on this game right when it cam out and that brings me to the cons as i see it.   Cons: This game has a lot of gear in it so you are often getting new items and then you have to go through and see which out of all the items is better for you and there no fast way to do that. That mixed with the crafting in the game means you can even augment certain weapons making them do tons more damage. I found that a weapon with a fire or air stat could have poison added to it for more damage then runes to add even more but there werent any other dmg types i could add making the weapons a bit odd to sort through some times.   Crafting is in no way intuitive and some items are just downright silly to craft. I will give a spoiler and say that honey and honey jars are the most op crafting item in the game since they can make charmed items which sell for large profit. You will often have to scour a website to craft things and thats a big con for me and i have 3 monitors.   Verdict: Over all the game is absolutely amazing and i give it a 9/10. I think the crafting and weapon/armor ui screens could be much more user friendly but overall that doesn't detract from the greatness that is divinity. If you have even read this far get the game you won't be dissappointed."

Dialogue/Story - The dynamic between the templar-esque people and the summoners is fun. Skills such as the one that makes you able to talk to animals serves as a way of having a unique experience that most people wouldn't pick. Though I have to say, some of the mid/later game story is pretty boring and I skipped through most of it.   Graphics - Game looks good as‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• I really enjoy the elemental damage appearance. Ex. Pouring rain on an area then hitting it when lightning.   Control - It's mostly point and click for everything. There are some pretty nice things in the game though, like the ability to detach certain members from the main party.   Replayability - I have yet to play half of the classes and two of the races in the game.   Overall - 9/10. Besides the story that begins to drag a bit near the mid/end game, it's ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•s of fun."

I've only played for about 16 hours so far and already I can see how vast the game is, how my choices have affected me thus far, and how I even wish I could start over knowing what I know now.

New additions are the choice of making your own character or choosing a pre-set one with variations on back story. There are significantly more spells and skills than before and you also have physical and magical armour. Being able to gain an advantage on the battlefield using height is a welcome addition. However, where I feel it is inferior to the first is the humour, there seems less in the sequel and I didn't care much for the playable characters. Despite this minor flaw I absolutely love the game and would recommend it to fans and newcomers alike."

This does not effect the overall game story, however, it's the extra content that they don't need to include, but do that impresses me. I have to give this game 10/10.

Shyrahja,146,1,0,"September 23, 2017",Recommended,95.2,"I am unsure where to begin with Divinity 2 at this point. This game has been and still is an amazing journey you can take on alone or with your friends.  I am hardly convinced with most of the games I play but Divinity has me on a collar. I cannot look away or stop playing it. I already am at 50H and haven't even experienced the whole singleplayer campaign.   The fact that you can talk with every single NPC, including animals (if you got the ""Pet Pal"" Talent early on), that you can explore every corner, find new clues and ways to secret caves or find treasure chests. All those aspects are a big yes for me to recommend Divinity2.   But was that all? Hell no. I haven't even covered 20 percent of what this game is capable of yet! I really enjoy freedom. I want to choose what to do, how to do it and, that should I take the wrong path in a conversation, have to deal with the backfire. Each race reacts differently towards NPC's (as do they. A lot of racism going on in this game) while adding more tags to your character such as ""Barbarian""""Scholar""""Outlaw""""Mystic""""Soldier""""Jester"" and ""Noble"" gives you the options to get more information out of them or successfully persuing them after they saw you stealing. (I have to add this since it caused me great pain. Do NOT click on a trader while they are walking by. I accidentally stole a bottle of wine instead of talking to the trader and hell on earth broke out. Never steal wine guys. NEVER.)   Each races armor looks different depending on what armor you give them. The same helmet looks differently for each race which means just getting out all the armor sets probably took ages and I am glad they put so much detail and work in this game. You can see the development teams heart in it. A great game that is meant to be so much more.  It is sometimes hard to keep the playerbase or even raise those numbers shouldn't there be options to replay the game after ""finishing"". Divinity did everything right. I am putting the word ""finish"" like this simply because of the fact that you will be having a hard time completing this game 100% if not impossible. So many options depending on what you chose while creating your character, while talking, whom you talk too and how. So many options to go, so much to explore, so many ways you can complete a single quest will make it hard for you to not get lost in this wonderful world <3  And I haven't even started to talk about the Game Master aspect. So far I have't been able to look at them simply because of the fact that the moment I have freetime I play the campaign.... I might be addicted at this point.  The option to create your own campaign, invite your friends or upload your work on Divnity's Steam Workshop will give you a never ending adventure.  My friendgroup started to use Divinity as DnD platform. Our GM creates the world and through Divinity you don't need to only imagine it, you can actually see and play your personal adventure.  Since the game is turn based you have everything a little RP heart needs to be happy.   In short: If you enjoy exploring, a never ending adventure and have a great time with your friends while playing Divnity's campaign, a downloaded one from the workshop or your own this is the game for you to play.  A long awaited tripple A game that has been worth all the wait. Hands up for an amazing adventure I will be enjoying for a long time!"

HappyThoughts,144,1,0,February 16,Recommended,178.9,"I loved it. It gave me the same feeling I had when I first played Dragon Age Origins, and I couldn't wait to wake up in the morning and get back into the game.  The turn by turn combat is rather well implemented. There aren't really any ""easy"" fights, or if so, very few, and as such each and every encounter has it's own importance.  If you read the forums a little you'll find out that there are both people complaining that the game is too easy and people claiming it's too hard. I think it is rather well balanced. Succeeding in combat relies a lot on knowledge. This means that you might find the first few battle frustrating . You will fail, but what's important is what you learn from each failure. Some fights can require quite a few reloads and changes in both strategy and equipment. As you learn to optimise your character as well as fully utilize the environment to your advantage you will progress.  The story is engrossing. I am unfamiliar with the previous games so I speak as an initate to the world of divinity. Each character of your group has a well-fleshed out backstory that you'll want to discover and a personal arc that you will want to see to its end. Dialogue is in general rather well written. The lore is easy to get into. There are a number of well-written books and scrolls you can read, but you can do without them. You'll grow familiar with the world as you interact with it, and nothing ever really confused me. For those of you worried it follows the current ""You are the Chosen One"" trend, well, it does, but only kinda. You are A Chosen One, not The. The world doesn't bend over backwards to suit your whims. In fact, Chosen Ones in this game seem to get very little respect.   The quests are all excellent. There isn't any ""filler"", you're never really told to go kill and 10 people. I think we can all fondly remember in specific games we played a select few ""memorable"" side-quests, distiniguishable by the fact that they had an actual story with their own characters and that they lasted more than ten axe-swings. In this game, most quests are as such. And they nearly all have multiple possible endings, depending on how you approached them.  The music is top-notch and the graphics are rather pleasant.   The wide-variety of possible character builds, the character stories to live through, and the multiple endings to each quest grant this game an immense amount of replayibility.   As someone who isn't really a perfectionist but does try to empty his quest log, my first run-through took me about 40-50 hours. For a 45 euro game, it's a fair amount of bang for your buck. "
Crow,124,1,0,"September 28, 2017",Recommended,109.2,"A game who got turn-based action right for once, the story is interresting and change's slightly based upon your choice's however if i had to say what i feel is best i would say ""voice acting"". The voice acting of this game reaches a yet unseen height in quality similar to that of a movie yet npc's are not limited to 2-5 lines like most but actually appear to have countless options based on what direction the conversation is heading towards.  I am thinking of how i would play it on my 2nd playthrough while i am not even past my first playthrough and what i would do differently for example if i should more of a villain, hero or merchant etc.  If Larian where to make a 3rd original sin i would buy it... i never tried the 1st but i got hooked from the 2nd even if it had a couple bugs and its crafting window was lacking."

Want to teleport your enemy 3 feet into the air into a pit of fire. ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it go for it. Want to go murder a castle of enemies just for the fun of it, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it go right for it.

Super Elephant,107,1,1,July 5,Recommended,140.0,"D:OS 2 is a thrilling and beautful adventure across the fictional land of Rivellon in search of becoming the next divine. The combat is deep and unique, and especially more fun on the higher difficulties where more strategy is involved. The voice acting is spectacular, particularly with the main cast of pre-generated characters.   However, where the game falls flat is its lack of originality in the main storyline. Esentially it brings upon the typical ""hey theres a bad guy and hes bad and powerful and we gotta be more powerful to defeat him"", with a few extra bits thrown in there. It continues like this until the later acts where it picks up. Thankfully, there are individual character stories that take place between for those before mentioned pre-generated characters, if you happen to have any in your party.  Overall, being a $45 title with easily 65+ hours content on just your first play through alone, this game is easily worth the price. And even being, there is an upcoming ""enhanced edition"" which is said to improve on the main story. I cannot recommend this game enough, despite its downfalls in the story and is easily in my top 3 games of all time."

Great character customization, a lot of different classes to choose from, you can learn new skills along the way by finding the scrolls as you play the game. Every companion and character you find/talk to in this game has an incredible story, every choice you make changes the way the story goes. The turn based combat is really fun, challenging and sometimes frustrating.  Now, this game doesn't hold your hand, it's not easy, everything you do requires thought and good decision making, from combat to quests, finding stuff, everything is a challenge. If you're looking for an easy story RPG you should probably look elsewhere.  So far i've only completed the first part of the game, or act 1 whatever you wanna call it (took me about 13 hours), and it might already be the best RPG i've ever played.   I give it a 10/10.

I got the feeling that I played a good old paper RPG like D&D: no proper ""classes"" (you mix your own), lots of characters, speeches, way to fight, ...  BUT it's definetly not for everyone. It's like you have a sadistic GM: it's tactical, it's hard, it's unforgiving. Prepare for looots of quicksaves, or you'll live with the consequence of your acts Wrong move ? Dead. Wrong answer to a pnj ? Dead. No characters with this ability ? Quest almost impossible to do  Exemple: (very very light spoiler ahead)  I could talk to a Scarecrow: i start the discussion, and then there was NO way, at least for my character as i build it, to avoid the fight with 10 scarecrow 2 level above of me -> F8 to last quicksave	  For those who know/liked the 1st opus: run for it ! Same base, but everything is enhanced, with a lot of quality of live changes, etc ...  I highly recommend for anyone who like hardcore tactical RPG. Btw, the 1st opus is absolutly not needed, for lore-lover, a quick wikipedia summary is enough.  -----------------------------------------  C'est un super jeu !  J'ai vraiment eu l'impression de jouer √† un RPG papier oldschool genre D&D: pas r√©ellement de classes (on construit celle qu'on veut), beaucoup de personnages, de dialogues, d'actions possibles ...  MAIS, c'est pas un jeu accessible/plaisant pour tous. Comme dit plus haut, c'est comme avoir un MJ sadique: c'est tr√®s strat√©gique, tr√®s dur et impardonnable. Pr√©parez-vous √† souvent faire des quicksaves, ou alors vous vivrez avec les cons√©quences irr√©m√©diables de vos actes. Faux mouvement ? Mort. Mauvais r√©ponse ? Mort. Aucun personnage avec telles comp√©tences ? Qu√®te quasi-impossible.  Exemple: (tr√®s tr√®s l√©ger spoiler)  Je pouvais parler avec un √©pouvantail, je lance donc le dialogue, √† partir de l√†, il n'y avait AUCUN moyen, pour mon personnage tel que je l'avais construit, d'√©viter le combat avec 10 √©pouvantails 2 niveaux au dessus de moi -> F8 vers la derni√®re sauvegarde rapide	  Pour ceux qui connaissent/ont aim√© le 1er opus: prenez sans h√©siter ! C'est la m√™me base, mais tout est am√©lior√©, avec beaucoup de modification ""quality of live"" , etc ...  Je recommande vraiment pour tous les fans de RPG ou tactical game un peu hardcore.

The gameplay is a callback to the classic RPGs era: isometric camera, point and click movement, multitude of meaningful different dialogue choices and choices in general, a strong emphasis on exploration to find secret caches and treasure, and a quest system that will not hold your hands. This game rewards you for being attentive and reading, more often than not you will not get clear quest markers that show you exactly where you need to go and what you need to do, you'll have to figure it out by yourself. The same goes for puzzles.  The world building is great, you will feel very inmersed into the lore, the characters and the world you're exploring. The world you play through is divided in 4 giant maps that you will access sequentially, however, you can freely explore and do things in the order you prefer within each one of these maps.  The writing and voice-over is also excellent, although sometimes a bit cheesy, but it's clear that most of the times it was intentional. The story is a lot more mature and dark than the first original sin's. Humor is nice. I recommend you take the Pet Pal talent with at least one of your characters, the dialogue with animals is just too good, sometimes hilarious and other times depressing.  As for difficulty, you have 4 options: explorer, classic, tactician and honor, which are easy mode, normal mode, hard mode and hardcore, respectively. Honor mode will delete your save if your entire party dies so you have to start over from the beginning, definitely not recommended for your first playthrough. Tactician is challenging at first and it will make you sweat each and every victory, but it's also really rewarding, and once you get the hang on the game's mechanics it will feel a lot more natural and accessible. Classic is still challenging especially if it's the first time you play the game, but enemies will have less health and armor, and the AI will be more prone to making tactically inefficient decisions to give the player some more room for mistakes. Explorer is the difficulty for people who just care about the story and want to breeze through the combat as quickly as possible.  And finally, multiplayer and extra features. Coop is a blast, playing a campaign with a friend is great. Up to 4 people can play together. the game adapts perfectly to multiple people playing the same campaign except for one thing: the dialogue. Only the person who starts a conversation with a NPC gets to choose the dialogue options, which honestly can be a little frustrating when you and your friends don't agree with something, but otherwise everything else is perfect. The game also features a GM mode where you can create and edit your very own campaign, and then share it with everybody else. I can't talk too much about this feature though because I have only checked it out real quick, it looks very complex and the editor seems like it gives the user a lot of tools, so all I can say is that the potential is there.   Overall, I won't be surprised if this game becomes a classic and we start seeing a lot of new CRPGs being born thanks to it. The developers have earned this success, and this is a 100% recommended purchase for every lover of the genre, and also for people looking for a great time even if they're not very keen on the genre."
The Geoff,91,1,0,"December 26, 2017",Recommended,131.5,"This game is rad as hell. There is so much attention to detail in every aspect of the game. It easily makes it into my ""Favorite Games of All Time"" list. I would do a long, in-depth review, but I feel like it would be better received if I did pro's and con's. However, know that I could gush about this game for hours.   PRO'S -Great Story -Incredible attention to detail and good flavor text -Great characters (The sassy lizard man and sassy skeleton are my favorites) -Combat is INSANELY fun, yet difficult -There are easily over 100 hours of gameplay in a single playthrough. I haven't even finished mine yet, and I'm at 94 hours while writing this. -Tons of quests -Different factions you can help, or ignore -You can have sex with a sassy skeleton -Cool environments and areas -Magic is actually fun and useful. (Something that I think is sometimes rare)  CON's -Pathfinding can sometimes make you facepalm -Character creation could be a little more in-depth -Some quests could use a liiiiittle more direction to the player because it can be hard to figure out where to go"

Big Daddy BeefDick,82,1,0,March 2,Recommended,263.6,"Fantastic Game if you're into RPGs. They took Divinity Original Sin and made it better it most aspects. The game is engaging all the way through and provides hours upon hours of game play with different ways of getting things done. The new restructure of Stats and Abilities makes you feel alot more in line with where you should be compared to other creatures of your level without feeling broken.   They simplified the way a lot of things work and the only one that irked me was Crafting. Crafting in Divinity Original Sin and Enhanced Edition really brought a lot to the game with money making and being able to stack resistances to make up for lower end gear that you just couldn't find an Upgrade for. In Divinity Sin Original Sin 2 you can forget about that and weapon enchants are down to just Two methods. Poison Barrel or an Eternal Object for Lightning. Poison Barrel adds Poison damage which honestly hurts for a ton of fights where you're partially healing the creature you're damaging(Undead).  The Dev Team is great, even after being released as a full game for this long they are still pumping out Bug Fix Patches and Game Balance Patches which shows they care about the Game and what the Community thinks.  I'd give this game an 8/10, Larian Studios really knows what they're doing."
Seppy,89,1,0,March 2,Recommended,56.4,"Total: 9.8/10  Here's my review    Customization/Progress 9.8 Customize things like: Appearance, Attributes, Abilites, Skills, Talents, Tags and your battle music whenever you kill an enemy. Every small upgrade you choose makes a big difference. Its a little poor when it comes to the face/hair customization but the other things makes up for it    Gameplay 9.8 Gameplay is smooth and feels immersive. Especially the dialogues and the impact it can have in most cases. The turn-based action gives you alot of time to think for the right moves and it's a game where you can relax and not just button mash your way through like Diablo. The ability to play with your friend(s) through the game is also very enticing. The reason I took away 0.2 of the score is because it can be quite confusing for newbies to find out what to do (especially if you haven't played Divinity 1 before)    Graphics 9.9 Suprisingly good graphics even up-close, but the ""Deathfog"" is annoying to watch while the camera is moving which is why I took away 0.1 score. Fortunately you won't see too much of it   Optimization 10 Very good optimization, with ""High"" settings I don't even notice frame drops in fights with alot of things going on.

There are some quest markers on the map but not for all quests. Basically if you enjoy a ton of exploring this game is for you. Personally I like my quests to be more laid out, it's just a choice thing. ~I also find the game fights to be very challenging, but also overly reliant on the game wanting you to use elemental combos. Trying to beat down an oppenent that is not weak to a certain element or combo just will not work. But using rain then hail, or oil then fire, or rain then electric = easy fight.  If I rated this I would give it a 7/10. If the questing was a tad easier/laid out more clearly it would be a 10/10 for me. Again that is just a personal choice with RPG type games. For sure a buy.  **Edit** Need to patch a few bugs I have found. The main one being the quest journal not updating."

Other people have been saying this is the game you dreamed about -- it is. I went into this thinking it was just a generic diablo clone (which I like) and instead got something with the depth and freedom of the first two fallout games and the writing of an HBO series. All the characters are vibrant and lively, and even with a custom character you can find yourself playing exactly the personality you want to play with how varied the choices are. I hope other companies take note -- this is the sort of RPG and storytelling people are after in open world games."
sonofabelll,78,1,0,"November 17, 2017",Recommended,213.6,"Where does one begin? I do my homework about games, and I rarely rarely rarely pre-order anything ever. This game. This game has everything correct about gaming. This game has everthing correct about having fun. This game reminds me of the days where I enjoyed the story, not just the 10-second thrill you get after grinding for 2 weeks for a better weapon. This game took me back to my first play throughs of ocarina of time, of donkey kong, and of knights of the old republic. The combat in those games were great, but the story is what made them legends.  Okay, so to make sense of everything I just wrote... Whatever you think you can do, chances are you can do it. Whatever you think you can't do, chances are you can do that too. For example, a mop bucket? OR A PROTECTIVE HELMET! Doing a sidequest to get a key to unlock the door? OR JUST SAY NUH-UH AND TELEPORT A GUY THROUGH THE GATE TO STEAL THE KEY FROM THE GUARDS AND THEN LET EVERYONE ELSE THROUGH BUT THAT RAISES THE ALARM SO NOW YOU HAVE TO BATTLE YOUR WAY OUT BECAUSE THE DUMBASS LIZZARD ISNT SNEAKY! Is that a weird black cat following you? OR THE MYSTIC BLACK WIZARD CAT THAT CAN TELEPORT YOU TO PLACES!  The game has so much content, and it intentionally bars you from about 1/3 of it due to party member limitations. The sheer amount of interaction my character has with the rest of the NPC's throughout the game and how it has shaped my path is amazing. The replayability is amazing...................oh yeah and I'm still in the first zone and I can say all that.  If you were wondering what you should do with that time off this holiday season, forget the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t EA is doing and buy this game."

It took me 100 hours to complete the game in Tactician mode and to clear Lohse's and Red Lobster's (uh, I mean the Red Prince) stories. I'm planning to restart the journey in HONOUR mode during the Thanksgiving break....   The battles are challenging (sometimes painstaking in Tactician mode) but almost all of them are well-designed.  I need to spend a lot of time making the strategy for each one, which as a result makes the victory more encouraging.  For me, a non-native speaker of English, the obstacles are some esoteric words. Hopefully in the enhanced version offical Chinese subtitles could be added.   P.S. I also got the DLC. The OST is awsome, so as the artbooks!"

I am now going through my second playthrough on Honour mode and another playthrough with my friends and am finding all sorts of quests and meaningful dialogue I passed by while playing solo.

Galahad,324,1,0,January 6,Recommended,272.0,"Games like this are what make me appreciate video games. This game has it all and is so well constructed. Larian has outdone themselves here and I can not recommend this game enough.  Some selling points:  -Deep strategic combat possibilities which feel amazing to master. Not only that, but the battlefields are usually constructed to allow for many approaches to combat. Status effects, different types of armor, and a myriad of skills and abilities means hundreds of ways to design a character and a vast amount of unique ways to approach combat.   - Flexible character customization possibilities. The game doesn't lock you in or punish you for not optimizing your character construction, instead it allows you to respec after you gain a deeper understandning of how everything works.   - Extremely pleasing aesthetically. Th terrain, art, armor  and weapon design, all beautiful. I enjoy just walking around in the game not even doing anything.  - Gripping and Engaging Atmosphere. The game pulls you in and contains realistic elements that make it's world fantastical but also believable. People actually notice when you steal something from them. They notice when you have a fight in the backroom of a tavern and forget to close the door.  - Interesting Origin Characters with their own stories but also the option to forge your own character in that world.  - Vast amount of things to do, places to see, secrets to find, enemies to kill. This game is huge and only costs 45 dollars. That alone makes it an alluring investment.  Downsides:  - some bugs, glitches. I've found these are very minor and usually solveable. Journal wasn't working, restarted game, fixed. Helmet stopped displaying on character, didn't care didn't like that helmet anyway. Larian clearly cares about this game and I think they will continue perfecting it.  - Learning Curve. I will say the game is a complex one to master and at first looking through all the skills, stats, terrains, items, etc. you can feel a bit lost. So it requires some patience. I found the complexity enjoyable but others may not.  Really I think this game is the definition of adventure, I've loved every minute going on quests, exploring, and feeling like I'm not sitting in front of a computer. It's blissful escapism and exactly what you want from a fantasy adventure game.  To anyone from Larian that reads this: thank you very much for your work and what you've created. It's a masterpiece and a fine example of what is possible when games are taken to their highest level. You should be proud."

Goose,277,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,161.1,"To say that this is a great game, actually does it a disservice, it is a phenomenally made game with amazing RPG elements and spot on tactical gameplay.   At first I thought the game was a bit overbalanced on the NPC's side,  but ended up finding out that it was just me.  A few key gear purchases and suddenly I was taking out fights that I had an incredibly difficult time before.  The combat does a great job of making you feel powerful while never making it feel easy.  Your tactics matter.  From your choices of companions (and what specializations they have) to the positioning on the battlefield, to trying to create your own ambush instead of getting ambushed is just amazingly done.  The game does not hand hold you along, but at the same time it does not feel hard to keep up with all the different quests and side missions that you have on your plate.  Not every fight is meant to be tackled the first time you see it and the game rewards you for taking out something in an ingenious way with an every increasing power level on your gear.  You are always advancing in one way or another.  I never write reviews, this is probably my first so hopefully that says something.  Such an amazing game, do yourself a favor and buy this!"

I then snuck in my rogue and back stabbed one of the archers (and turned him into a chicken). Next came my wayfarer, using fossil strike and a fire arrow I blocked the enemy from approaching my backline. Afterwards my summoner made a bunch of creatures. Poison, explosions and madness ensued  While all this was happening the boss was still casually talking, replying to my threat 'That's cute.' with a rogue behind him, 4 summons next to him and a wayfarers crossbow aimed at his skull.

NEW PLAYER ADVICE/TUTORIAL If your starting divinity as a new player, heres some advice before you start running into the game head-on thinking this is skyrim; as you will add to the list of players claiming this game is way too hard on classic mode...   No spoilers here btw.  STARTING THE GAME At the very start of the game you are asked to create your character (sorry, spoiler!). DO NOT RUSH THIS PART OF THE GAME. Before you even look at building a class, or rushing into the game, the classes in the game develop over the course of the game, so your playstyle with said character will also change. This game is very slow and methodical, not unlike a game of chess; you have to plan ahead and think through your actions, there is no timer!  For players that have come from COD, or Diablo etc. this is not hack and slash, so you cant just run in head-on; its like sending your king and queen in to try and kill the pawns as fast as possible. try to think about what will happen each turn, and plan 2 turns ahead.  SAVE OFTEN pretty much self explanatory, but you get jumped a lot, so safe often so that you dont have to retrack the past 10 mins of walking around.  READ EVERYTHING AND SPEAK TO EVERYONE. This is probabally the best piece of information i can supply, and without revealing too much. divinity is about tactics not hack and slash, so speak to as many NPC's as possible and explore every area. this will grant you more experience and access to more items. As the enemies in divinity are all level based, this will allow you to stand on equal footing with them, rather than being 3 levels; wearing a loincloth and wielding a knife on a stick (actual weapon, sorry spoiler!) against a group of 7 decked out enemies all positioned in highground and chokepoints. Also reading enemies weaknesses and levels/armor etc. will help you to control fights better.  YOU DONT HAVE TO GO THAT WAY! Many situations you come up against will look pretty damn scary, especially when you realize the enemies ounumber you, outflank you and outlevel you. This usually means you are underlevelled for the area you are currently in, so go back and complete a few more side quests, or just try taking a different route and coming back to said area (hint, you might not even HAVE to complete that area, but this could mean it holds some good items, and more levels!).  WHAT IF... This is the most important question to be asking yourself during the course of the game, and will mean the difference between winning a fight with 0 Deaths, and losing a fight without killing a single enemy... analyse what you can do, what can happen if you do it, and how your opponent can respond (sorry this is vague, trying not to spoil anything). abuse the terrain and your opponents limitations!  TO CONCLUDE This game is as difficult as you make it, which is why a large group of people find it so difficult, because their game is half complete! turn every area upside down before you move on, as there is probably about 3 quests you missed with 2 levels of xp. And DONT RUSH CHARACTER CREATION! Dont be ashamed if you start a new game after playing for an hour on your first playthrough, i did, because i realised i missed so much and learnt what i was doing wrong. Good luck and take your time!  (spoiler) PS. dont let the cat die...       "
Hexadorus,189,1,0,"December 4, 2017",Recommended,160.7,"I don't write many reviews on Steam, but I just have to say that this is a RPG gem.  The sheer amount of content will keep you occupied for several playthroughs, and the way it handles co-op is exceptional.  Bringing a friend or three along for the ride is so fun, and doesn't feel tacked on; your story will become that much more interesting, and at times hilarious when your friends are calling out for help!  If EA published this game, it would cost you thousands of dollars for this much content, which makes the actual pricetag a steal.  I haven't had this much fun in a top-down Roleplaying game since Baldur's Gate II.  If you're on the fence about buying this game, take it from me that you will be engrossed in the story if you wind up purchasing it.  It does take several hours to get into the swing of things, but after that, you won't be able to put it down."

That being said, I've probably played through this game like 6 times so far and not only is it still so fun, I'm pretty certain there are still things I have yet to see! The game is amazing as is, but the mods really let you take it to the next level.  Already, there are mods for crafting, combat balancing, new spells/items, and a host of other really cool/enriching elements that can be added.  I love to browse the workshop to see how I can spice up my next play through.  I'm more of a single-player person and so I haven't tried playing this game online, but I imagine if you enjoyed multiplayer then there will be 100s of more hours of quality gaming to be found with D:OS 2.

yvesp,67,1,0,"December 26, 2017",Recommended,375.6,"Larian turned gold to lead, but this game is probably worth it, provided that you know what you do.  First off, choose wisely your play level. I chose tactician as a veteran of RPG. I was well served. Indeed, tactician it is! But it doesn't say that you should also scratch every single little advantage that you can (steal as much as possible, stack on potions etc.) in order to be well prepared for the last fight. It also doesn't say that you shouldn't expect your characters to be heroic! Indeed, in many situations at that level you will have to resort to cheesy tactics such as some characters fleeing the combat to recover skill timers, heal, then come back while the combat has been frozen because you left one character or invocation hold it... Or by reloading consistently because you were not prepared for a nasty surprise in a combat and had nothing left to deal with it; so you reload, come back with smart prepositionning and the combat will go smoothly. I remember a fight against some outrageous horror -helped by numerous cronies, all of them more powerful than my characters despite being one level above-, which I easily lost head to head, then won after reloading, placing my characters far enough, engaging with invocations and keeping my characters far enough -actually out of combat- that I could always cast a new invocation when one died. I finally won that fight without a scratch. Smart ? sure. Pleasurable ? Hardly.  So unless you like going very slowly, always moving like there is a fight at the next step (or reloading often), managing inventories to be sure each character has the absolute best equipment, has the necessary consumables,  and so on (i.e. total micromanagement), skip the tactician level. At normal level, the game is going to be challenging enough for most players. Especially the last combat, which I never finished -I have done quite well in the first part, but am hopelessly outnumbered in the second part. I probably know what is wrong, but I won't be going back batching the potions that I am missing, respecing my characters to more useful stats, traits and spells, changing runes for more useful ones etc. you get the picture for tactician level.- So, I won't know the end of the story line I chose, and I won't change my storyline just so the last combat is easier. That's a bit sad.  And NO: YOU CANNO'T CHANGE THE DIFFICULTY LEVEL DOWN! That's a real shame!  Also, there is no excuse for larian in turning an excellent character development/combat system into the mediocre thing that it has become. In that respect, Original Sin 1 was way better. The current system has clearly been designed in order to foil the player and outrageously favor the opponents. You cannot inflict secondary effects (blinding, stunned etc.) as long as the target has magical or physical armor (a new protection that comes above your hit points.) This means that the first rounds of combat are always going to be damage dealing: you won't have any crowd control coming until you've done some attrition first. Worse: the system favors teams which choose a damage type and stick to it. I made the mistake of wanting a balanced party: the result is that I am too weak for the last fight. Actually in some fights, I had characters standing aside, watching the combat go because they did not deal the right kind of damage...  After all this has been said, I still recommend this game because the story looks good, the world is well developped and generally speakig as RPG go, it stands on the top if you don't fall into the trap where I fell.  EDIT: I finally found the courage to do what I said I wouldn't do, and of course finish the game. As expected, I had to respec my characters, and decided to go for lone wolf. The advantage in lone wolf lies not in the power of the characters (they indeed are stronger, but you have overall less firepower), but in the fact that you don't have to bother about the survival or such and such character, as well as reducing the drain on your consumables (you use two instead of four for a similar effect.) The fight was easy [SPOILERS (light) AHEAD] mostly for use of the special tea sold by Mrs Kremm, combined with at least +50% full elemental protection potions and five star dinner -i.e. all elemental damage did heal me, which both let me remove most healing spells as well as use my own offensive spells for healing-, the pawn and duck duck goose (for good movement, not mentioning spells.) Other talents which I thought would help did not (guerilla) [END SPOILERS] ; I changed my main character from pure mage to hybrid melee (fighter) / mage, helped by an archer/assassin ; as explained above, this was a choice to favor physical damage over magical damage, choice made necessary by the difficulty of that fight. I of course had to spend considerable time to prepare the characters and the consumables, buy or craft the required potions and books as well as redistribute equipment. The trouble is that in that fight I did not recognize the character(s) I played consistently from the beginning (no respec before the end), which is annying (to say the least) for a RPG! The other trouble is of course that I could not have to feeling that the hero was well above the other contenders to deserve my victory. Indeed, the stats of all other human opponents were consistently above those of the hero. Understand who can!"
Nekomatagirl,108,1,0,September 4,Recommended,117.0,"--No spoilers--  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a game that at first kind of looks meh. The graphics might not appeal to some and others might find the spells and other things clunky at first. But the game is rather quite the opposite of those problems. It's a great game but a game you need to get invested into. I enjoy the combat greatly because there is so much to do and so much to interact with. I also really enjoy sidequests and this game has a ton of them. There is a lot to explore and discover.  At the time of writing this I have about 116 hours and still haven't completed the game. Do not think that it tastes that long to finish a campaign, but merely there is a lot to look and do. One of the problems of the game isn't even the game's fault. It is the players. Some people drop games or get to busy to continue.  I've restarted the main campaign about a dozen times (sometimes my fault) before finding someone that would go all the way. But it really is a blast when you are with a friend or friends.  Though I must say the crafting system is kind of lackluster when it comes to anything but potion making. I barely use it unless it's to make potions. Some places are annoying to deal with and that one battle with oil slugs or whatever they were called didn't do my computer any good. Loading screens are longish but you barely have to do any load screens at all because the entire map is just available to you. The dialogue and narrator are also one of my favorite parts of the game.   Overall? I recommend it highly! It's absolutely worth it."

You'll want to replay this game with new character ideas or to test your knowledge of the game in tactican or honour mode. But if I thought DOS1 was brilliant and needed changes, then I must admit I feel the same way about DOS2. My main issue being that the combat system filters you to certain ways of playing which DOS1 did too but DOS2 does in different ways. Party of 4? Stick to either physical or magical damage focus for all, as mixing stats makes both weak or one side essentially useless (but doable on explorer mode). Party of 1 or 2? Hit that Lone Wolf talent on character creation and you'll have the most fun the game can give. To an extent you can mix damage skills quite well and not have a bad character.   With that said, you'll have many hours of fun making characters that work and even those that don't (which you can thankfully fix after act 1)."

So I am now unabashedly jumping on the bandwagon, writing that the game deserves every praises and accolades showered its way.  As a computer role playing games veteran, I played its spiritual ancestors, the likes of ""Baldur's gate"", ""Neverwinter"", ""Planescape: Torment"" and ""Arcanum"", and I can say that I am feeling right at home with Divinity: Original sin 2. It feels and plays the same but not quite, with the improvements in technology providing luscious sceneries and sumptuous special effects, all the while with great sounds, voices and a haunting music.   The combats can be made as difficult as one wants, and there is a whole world to explore with its mechanics and secrets. Spells and environments combos are there for the finding (or the googling...). There is very little hand holding but at the same time the game offers many ways to solve its plethora of quests and side stories, and it is designed in such a way that walking off the most obvious path is rewarded ""sometimes"" so it leaves the player wondering whether he should. Compulsive item collectors will have either a field day or nightmares trying to keep track of everything, and new dialogues will open up depending on which character speaks or takes the action.  So if you feel like going on a great adventure, alone or with friends, grab the game, then your sword, staff or wand, and be prepared for the journey of a lifetime (or two, or three..)."

Some of the best voice acting I've ever heard in a game, really can't recommend this enough.

VonKlaus,357,1,0,"September 24, 2017",Recommended,100.5,"Wow.  I just finished my first full playthrough and this is easily the best game I have played this year.  It took me 67 hours at a moderate to slow pace and I was mainly of the first 2 difficulty modes.  The only real negative that I have is that I wished they had kept more of the weapon and armor upgrading from the first game.  That said, the runes you can add to items do help fill that role.  Well done Larian on such a fantastic expierence!"
Thunderface,77,1,0,May 12,Recommended,162.4,"it's simply the best  ISO-rpg out there. And unlike most of them, it has a great story, voice acting, and world all combined. I never felt the best combination of those things since planescape torment or Diablo II. The gameplay is deep and thought provoking. And the ability to manipulate the evironment is second to none.   The game ALMOST falls into the 'you are the chosen one' trope (like the first one) but does a clever twist on it towards the end. The pacing can be tough, and the story can be fragmented  - but that is the nature of a real 'choose your own adventure'. The begining animated sequence is a little add as well. It was better in the alpha when it just immersed you in the world straight away.   Fane (the skeleton) and Izban (soldier) are by far the best voice actors and background stories."

There is a ton of polish. And the world building is fantastic. I feel like I'm reading a LOTR series, except I get to take part in the events. There are kings and queens and emperors, and monsters and villains and heros and gods, and things going on over here and over there while I'm doing my thing.  Most current RPGs make it really hard for me to imagine myself as taking part in the story. For DOS2, it takes almost no effort. I really want to know what happened to my characters ancestors, and what my friend wants to do, and what their family is doing, etc. I can make decisions based on how I would react in each situation.  And on top of all of that, they have coop too! Like WTF, they don't know when to stop!  It really feels like a labor of love. For what you get, this game is wayyy undervalued - I'd be willing to pay at least $80 for all of these features."

Faux Dog,222,1,0,January 11,Recommended,312.3,"Probably one of the best strategy RPG games I've ever stumbled across. I bought the game back during it's EA, before a lot of the current content was around since it was cheaper then. However, finally taking the time to play it has shown me it was worth waiting for.  Fights all require a lot of strategy, I always end up challenging myself on SP by having no companions. I sometimes get cheesed out in fights, but have always re-tried with different tactics in order to overcome what was presented to me.  There's a lot of side quests and fights to help you level up if you find yourself behind in a particular location.  tl;dr +Good combat system. +Character respecs allow you to change your character if you're not liking your build. +Looks and feels fantastic as games go. +Music is awesome, instrument choice isn't used in every track, but combat incorperates it.  =Loot everything, never know where a good item will generate.  -Some fights will cheese you to death if you play solo like myself(So not inherent fault of the game.) -Saving can take a very long time if you've interacted with all the objects(Again, probably mt own fault.)"

As is, at the time of writing this review, Divinity has come the furthest amongst its RPG peers in reaching a new degree of freedom and player agency. The amount of effort put in by Larian Studios often breaks the fourth wall and smacks you in the face from behind the monitor. It is just that obvious.

I have played quite a few Divinity games, Divinity I, Divinity I Enhanced, and now this one. sadly, I have not beaten Divinity one just yet...becasue this game has ensnared me it it's beautiful artwork, charecter classes, and story. In this game, Divinity one is turned around as you now play a sorceurer, the 'bad guys' from the first game.   As expected, the combat is tougher than the first since you start with the bare minimum. You can't run in swinging on the first Island, it takes quite a while before you reach the 'run and gun' stage of blowing away the compition. hell, I was wrecked by some silent monks because a spell went a little crazy.   The Island rquiers you to play smart...very smart. you need to watch everything and make sure you are not standing in water before you electrocute it. you have to look for archers hidding in the bushes. You have to heed the warning of 'don't break this jar or something bad will happen to you' (That something bad being five skeletons showing up an wrecking your face)  In short, the game is difficult if you are reckless. A single wrong click will screw you faster than a missed swing in Dark Souls. I recommend saving often and having a backup file just in case. the Island will trap you, and It will kill you. You have little hope of succsess... Welcome to Rivalon.   now, some positives and negatives: PRO: -Voice acting. Totaly worth it -stratagy to make my brain hurt -A litteral TON of loot -dark humor in a dark game that I shouldn't have found so funny. -steal EVERYTHING!....then die -Super Rewarding when you reach that point where you can actually fight, insted of flail and hope you hit. -A actual story, something that I miss in many of the other games I play, complet with plot, conflict, and a resolution...if I ever get there.   CON: -The mouse can be very picky when you click, and will not hesitate to f**k you over. It can be a real rage feast when you try to shoot an arrow, but insted you walk next to the guy with a sword bigger than you. -The Price. I got this a while ago when it was in development and I had the money. After playing Divinity one, I scooped this game up fast. If you are on the fence about the game, wait until it goes on sale. This game is totally worth the price to me, but I knew what I was getting into. 20/10"

Del,147,1,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,181.5,The most enthralling RPG I have played in years. Improves upon the original in every way concievable. The game encourages you to cheat and break it in any way possible and never skips a beat because of it. There are endless permutations of party compositions and this is one of the few RPGs where just about any character you could make is viable (unless you want to mix bows/daggers/spears with swords also spears suck don't use them even though you want to)  -A person who hates turn based combat
DASUltima,316,1,0,"October 12, 2017",Recommended,155.4,"This game is a masterpiece, plain and simple.  I highly recommend it to all those remotely interested.  Coming from somebody who had not finished the original due to several factors, including; messy story-line and general boredom from the odd pacing set in the game, I can wholeheartedly say that this game vastly improved upon the original's flaws and then some.  The player comes for the game-play (advertised as no rules sandbox of sorts), and stays for the story (which kicks off rather nicely). And truly what magnificent game-play and storytelling it is. The adventure is told through both ""Origin"" characters and an unique ""tag"" system that allows the player to select titles of sorts that give additional dialogue options. Pretty neat stuff.  There is never a dull moment to this game as it is stuffed to the brim with content. Over 120 hours played and I still don't want to put it down. Adding mods to the equation just adds more and more replay-ability.  Granted while the difficulty can be rather steep for some, and having beaten it on ""Honour Mode"" (Ironman on steroids), I can say with certainty that truly enjoying the game requires both and open mind and a knack for the unconventional.  Thank you Larian, for easily the best experience the past several years.  Tldr: Play, Love, Kickstart Divinity Original Sin 3"
Suq Madiq,171,1,0,"September 18, 2017",Recommended,109.3,"The game is alot of fun and i have had a great time in it, so far the only and biggest complaint is how buggy the quest journal is and just ignores updates through the game.  Hopefully this will get a fix or a mod to sort it out."

Plenty of (well narrated) quests will keep you busy for many hours. The character development and skill system is also interesting since it provides to opportunity to try out different approaches to gameplay and combat. What I also like is the fact that the higher difficulty levels are definitely challenging and require some planning before engaging in combat.  However, the complexity might too challenging for people how want to have some quick fun. You will need some time to get used to all the options that you have.  Camera movement is also a bit annoying in my opinion ... but maybe I am too clumsy. Many people also seem to have experienced save game bugs, which is of course a pain in the‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•and should not happen after release.   All in all, I definitely recommend buying the game but be aware of possible save game bugs. Hopefully, good sales will result in more games of that quality."

In terms of strorytelling, this rpg provides an immersive experience with a story you won't guess from the first gameplay hour. It's epic and it's character dependent (to a point). The optional pre-made characters enrich this story, even if the player does not play one (they can also be rectuited as party members).  In terms of rpg gameplay dynamics, the potential this game offers for character skill variation can result in absurdly overpowering characters, yet the level progression system somehow compansates; resulting in a feeling of powermonger.  On top of these, all dialogues are voice acted, graphics are beautifully stylized (ne can especially find the richly colorful style goes quite interesting with story) and the game camera works wonders.  As a result, I was quite happy that I backed this game and it was honestly better than I expected."

You also need to pay attention to what's going on, as with the original there is almost no hand holding in classic mode. I my case this lead to me falling back into old habbits and killing everyone that looked at me funny. Due to what appears to be an increased aggro range this has lead to most of the camp now being used to grit the path when it gets icey (i'm guessing this will come back to bite me, but it's fun anyways).

Definetely worth every penny even if you buy it for the full price.  I don't believe there are any other RPG out there that makes the class system so obsolete. You can play with your character any way you like, literally.. Wanna play a melee pyromancer mage? An elementalist who controls every element? A baddass ranger who is also a dual wielding rogue? A Warrior with a big‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•weapon who flies (yes, with wings) around the battlefield while shooting laser rays out of his/her‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• Go ahead, no one is stopping you. Your own imagination is the only limit in this case.  Multiplayer is also fun, nothing beats when your friend uses a poison bottle (combined with red dye to look like a healing potion) in combat and dies without knowing why or how. You can play with up to 4 players online or even play local co-op if you have 2 controllers.  Also, speaking with animals? PRICELESS! A powerful wizard who happens to be a rooster, known by the name of Magicockorel, teleports you away if you make the mistake of not believing in him and call him a liar. The conversations are so good that I felt like speaking to a dog or a chicken. What else to say?  But to be honest there are some flaws in the game, especially in the inventory management and crafting sections. I wish the developers had implemented some basic UI options like a simple ""search"" bar to ease dealing with the overwhelming components, ingredients and foods that keeps piling up in the inventory page. Minor bugs in quests are also present that sometimes prevents a quest completion.   Nevertheless, it's a GREAT GAME."
Gamrage,86,1,0,May 8,Recommended,384.2,"I'm surprised that I haven't written a review of this game since I first started playing it. This game from my own perspective offers quite a bit.   Story: Every single quest has multiple ways of being approached and there is no system of good or evil. You could be doing good thing for terrible people or bad things for noble causes. You could just be pure evil for the sake of being a jerk, and you could make every kindhearted decision out there. There is no wrong choice and anytime you block a certain path due to a choice you made, there is always another option to be explored.  For the amount of choices that this game gives you in terms of social and story progression, it's worth a full price buy in that alone.  Gameplay: Honestly, there is no such thing as a game without bugs. For all the bugs that this game has, it has a devoted team of developers to constantly patch and repair whatever the community reports to them. For every feature the community asks of the devs, they take everything into careful consideration. The combat mechanics are simple and complex at the same time. Every attack has it's own property, physical or magic. Physical damage has no sub categories while magic damage splits into, fire, water, earth, poison and wind. What makes the magical damage so complex is how the elements interact with each other and the environment to make the gameplay more immersive.   Unfortunately, if you want to play the game for pure optimization and not immersion, most people go into pure physical damage builds to ignore the majority of elemental immunities that certain enemies might have in the game.  To sum it up, the game is great and worth more than it sells for."

Jubi,103,1,0,May 16,Recommended,335.3,"REVIEW UPDATE Adding on some extra thoughts due to the Definitive Edition.   The Definitive Edition takes an amazing game and makes it even better. Performance improvement, glitch fixes, balance changes, a revamped ACT 4 and a lot of quests got extra dialogue to improve flow and better explain objectives. Inventory system and the Journal are much better now.  Nearly every improvement was for the better - the only ones that anyone might be upset about are the exploits that got fixed!   My original review is down below. But in short: The Definitive Edition is an improvement on an already amazing game.     -----ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW-----   Easily one of the best games I've played. You can go at it solo, controlling anywhere from 1 to 4 characters, or team up with friends for up to 4 player co-op.    A rich, beautiful world, memorable NPCs, great story telling and voice acting, fun quests. It's earned every single award it got.  Plus there's so many different ways to play! It has a very tatical aspect to it: building your character up, trying skill combos, moving around the varied battle fields, using mechanics to your advtange, controling the fights through terrain effects. It's challenging, but as you get stronger you actually feel stronger. As you leran more you start finding ways to overcome fights by clever use of mechanics rather than brute force. Of course, the brute force works juts fine!    There's no defined ""class system"" - as you level up you can put your skill points anywhere you want. As you gain more skill points in different areas (like say necromancy or pyromancy) you become more effective with those types of abilities, and can learn stronger abilities in those trees. You can freely respec anytime you want after Act 1, making the only cost to respec being your armor and skill books. This system allows you to try out tons of different builds: and a lot of them work! You're starting class only determines your starting skill points/abilities and weapons you'll get (which will all be replaced quickly). But even then you can customize your class during character creation.  You can go at it with origin characters, characters that have a lot of extra presonal story and quests built into it, or make up your own character! Want to be an undead lizard? Go ahead. Even if you aren't playing an origin character, you can still recruit them as party members to see their stories (but you won't have as much control over it).    It's an amazing game."

I spend so much time fine tuning my party's skills not because I feel like I have to to make progress, but because I want to because it's so much fun. So many quests, so many choices, so much fun.  If you buy this game and feel overwhelemed at the starting Fort Joy, try to get past that hump. I almost dumped this game because it was too hard with no good gear but now I'm having a blast."

[ Áãº ] Wulfee,131,1,0,"September 9, 2017",Recommended,97.9,"I have to say, they really did it this time. If anyone knows how to make a new game whilst improving on it, Larian knows how.  Pros- +Gritty- Honestly the first DOS was a bit too much on the comedy-irony side of the coin, and lacked the emotions I wanted from an rpg. DOS 2 on the otherhand, flipped that and made it a more emotional world where you connect with the people you save (or at least try saving). +Spell combination- Spells combined and formed new wonders in the first game, now it's even better with logical after effects. Stone skin putting out fire and stopping bleeding makes sense, and thats exactly what'll happen here. +Graphics- The graphics have improved, and no longer do people look like cartoonish buffoons living a care free life like in dos 1. Though I do hope they add in more customization to characters, and i'll get to that soon.  Cons- -Character customization- There was barely any in the first game when it came to choices, unfortunately it's the same here. Hopefully with better mod support we can just get it through the workshop. But I have hoping to have a deeper character customization. -Elves- The elveslook very strange indeed, nothing like its counterpart in the opening picture. They seem to have dents or vein lines? or something weird across their body, and look more akin to the avatars (those tall blue folks) than an elf. Maybe thats just how they look in the Divinity universe, but who knows.  So far that was all that I could think of. At this time the game is still in early access so I don't want to criticize the other parts yet, like the lack of portrait pics for npcs or no voices, but till then kudos and cheers."

I can't write one of those hyper-detailed ""very useful"" reviews, but:  1) the entire game is hand crafted with great detail and care. Everything has had a great deal of thoughtful effort put into it.  2) there is a LOT of it. This a long and content-filled game. You can rush through it much faster if you want, or spend time to see it all.  3) graphics are great, actually beautiful, detailed and rich  4) voice acting is top quality, and the game is fully voiced  5) the environment is very open-ended.

Sargonist,51,1,0,"September 16, 2017",Recommended,62.8,"Very VERY Good game. Exciting, Story Driven, great customization.. The only thing id say about it, and its NOT a negative, is its VERY HARD. If you create a HERO, and DON'T build him/her correctly & a good mix of party members, you MIGHT find yourself stuck, dying every direction you choose to go the first few hours. In fact you might have to start over a few times. Choices MATTER so MUCH, Saying the WRONG thing to the WRONG person can spell disater VERY quickly. Tread conversations with Most anyone very CAREFULLY. I reccomend researching the kind of build you want and forming a very good party to mix them in with. The Voice acting is INSANE, EVERYONE has a voice, and conversations rarely follow the same route with each different party member.  I only have 10+ hours in this game, but i can tell the REplay value is  going to be great. Another thing, is multiplayer seems to need a little ironing out.. So if youre buying this for Solo, GO FOR IT.. Multiplayer? UNLESS you have  FOR SURE Friend(s) to play with, id hold off on Multiplayer with RANDOMS for now. All in All, id say buy this game ASAP..  its worth every penny..  This is like.. my 2nd review.. so sorry if its lame.

B√ºrgermeister,140,1,0,"October 11, 2017",Recommended,129.1,"At first I was hesitant at getting this. It looks great, and like a lot of fun, but maybe not worth the price. I thought maybe I'd pick up the game on a sale or something.  But I'm very glad I got it.  The story is very rich and there's so many ways to play. I'm excited for my second and third play throughs.   You can steal from anybody, kill anyone, befriend NPCs, talk to your followers if you choose to have them, and each story is different from character creation. Each race is treated differently, you have different dialogue options if you're an Outlaw, or Scholar, or even if you play a smart Wizard, you can persuade people with your smarts, or intimidate people with your strength.   The combat is very fun, and comboing spells and attacks is awesome.  Classes aren't really set in stone either. If you're a Fighter but decide you want to shock people, or grow some wings, you can very much do so.   And the GM mode is amazing.   As a Game Master for D&D games, I've always wanted a game to play it in, to immerse the players, and let them explore with out having to explain every small detail. And this game does it very well. You can create custom items, NPCs (even down to what hat they wear), allies, and customize the pre set maps the game gives you. I would honestly buy a DLC that includes more maps. But there are plently right now, I'm just afraid that through multiple play throughs we'll all think ""Oh, this map again.""  This game is a masterpiece, but it's not perfect.  The combat is very hard, even on the easiest difficulty it sometimes feels like I need to kill a couple NPCs who don't deserve it so I can level up and continue the story. And sometimes this makes the game feel linear. I don't know if I'm missing something, or I chose bad classes for my party, but either way that's a big down side for me.  That being said, at the time of posting this review I'm 71 hours in, and I havent even completed my first play through, which is a good thing. I'm taking my time, exploring the world, talking to every NPC and living the world.  UPDATE (very minor spoilers):  I finished the game, and I have to say while the ending was good, it was very buggy. I was unable to use res scrolls, enemies would teleport everywhere, and some other minor things.  Arx also felt very bland for what it could have been. Driftwood and all of Reaper's Coast felt huge, and there was so much story there, but Arx... You were there for one thing, and that was to beat the game. I tried to find more to do there, I tried to find side quests, just anything, but there was nothing. Maybe I missed stuff, maybe I didn't. Either way I feel the game no longer deserves my original score of 8.5/10.  8/10"

A coop strategy RPG, with enough customization, depth and variety in character creation and builds to keep you busy for a long time.   After playing around 20 hours I still haven't decided on a build or character that I want to continue on. (I'm very picky) There's so many fun mechanics that it's hard for me to decide.   That being said it's not SCARY depth-filled. If you're casual you can still pick up an easy build and steamroll for the great VOICED story. THEY ACTUALLY VOICED THIS GAME WHAT?!

RC,37,1,0,February 20,Recommended,280.3,"This is the first time I have written a review on steam, and this game made me do it.  I'm playing honour mod, and after some 40 hours, and about 2-3 dead characters, I've succesfully managed to get to level 6 with a very solid party that is looking to become very powerful.   Lore: I haven't played any of the other divinity games, and am completely clueless to the lore. However, the NPCs do a good job of explaining their views on the world, and there's various books you'll find giving you insight on different, relevant subjects. I'm not the guy who usually reads books in rpgs, but in DoS2, so far at least, there's only a couple of pages long at most, with interesting content.  Companions: I instantly got hooked on the potential companions, legit within the first 30 minutes of playing the game and without even being aware they were potential companions. Very unique personalities, well written dialogue, excellent voice acting and actual, interesting backstories. It's so good it's actually difficult to pick who you wanna roll with. In turn though, that adds to the games replayability factor, so that's another plus.  Fane and the Red Prince though, those guys will probably be in all of my campaigns.   Speaking of replayability: You can get crazy inventive on your builds. There is SO much you can do with your talents and skills. Want a traditional DPS Archer? No problem. Death knight wielding necromantic skills, a big‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•weapon and plate armor destroying the front lines? Sure. Support caster? Fire mage raining hell? Electromancer thundering all over the battlefield? no problem.  Also, skills combo really nicely with each other so not every comp is viable, and on the harder difficulties you don't want to spread too thin (Jack of all trades and master of none will not get you far). You also want to not create anti-synergy. A water/ice wizard will combo extremely well an Electromancer, obviously, but not as well with a fire mage or geomancer.    Strategic layer:  On the honour mod (perma death), this game does an exceptional job of encouraging tactical play and strategic decisions. Xcom2 - Long War on legendary difficulty comes to mind as a comparison, except you don't really have to deal with ridiculous RnG punishing otherwise brilliant play.  Combat: 10/10.   Story: Very engaging and immersive. Also you can do pretty much anything in this game. There's nothing stopping you from walking in the city, guns blazing, and attacking everyone in sight. Well, except from getting killed. So maybe don't do it at level 2.   Quests: Can be finished in a good number of ways. They're unique, they have flavour, are interesting and I have yet to find a single ""Go fetch me 15 of x object"" types of errands, or a quest repeating itself.  Like I said, I haven't played any of the other games and am completely new to this title. And yet this review still reads as if it was written by an avid fanboy. What can I say, it's just that good. For the quality this game offers, honestly, it should cost at least double. Get it. Stuff like this does not happen very often."

ScottaBlast,149,1,0,"December 16, 2017",Recommended,137.0,"Oh boy, where to start?  In the past, I've played the original Divinity, multiple GOTY RPGs such as The Witcher III and Skyrim, along with playing Dungeons and Dragons for years.  After beating this game on classic difficulty, I've realized it is my favorite game of all time, trumping those previously mentioned.  Divinity 2 is the closest I've ever seen a video game get to DnD, near perfectly emulating the freedom of the players.  Notice how I didn't say sense of freedom or illusion of freedom.  Other games try to decieve you into thinking your actions matter, when in all actuality, they make little to no difference.  Here, the game responded multiple times to actions I had done dozens of hours prior.  Not only in simple little references, some had astronomical impacts.  There are also 4 different endings with significant, world-changing differences. You can try to kill anyone, try to steal anything, and have to live with the consequences.  It doesn't hold your hand, and because of that, it makes every decision and discovery you make feel like your own.  Divinity 2 is also a huge step up from the previous game, mainly in terms of overall polish.  The original game was great, however there was an incredibly boring starting zone, poor music, sub par graphics, and nonexistent character in your party.  This sequel does what any true sequel does and improves on the old, in nearly every way, while adding new elements.  Upgraded music, graphics, along with the introduction of origin characters with some of the best writing I have ever seen help breathe more and more life into an already thriving world.  The developers also streamlined the combat system while keeping the depth that make it the king of tactical rpgs.    One of the things that stood out to me was how good the story was and told.  With a lot of big, AAA games such as destiny, there is an amazing story, but the delivery is mediocre, turning a great concept into a meh grind.  Here, everyone is fully voice acted well.  You can tell from talking to people in game that this was a labor of love.  The actors poured their hearts and souls into their performance and it really shows.  The story is also brimming with twists and turns that you never see coming, which caused me on occasion to stop in shock, before yelling at the monitor or tearing up.  There is also one origin story character quest (Lohse's) which really hit me hard.  Never have I ever been so happy for a character before.  Then there is the multiplayer.  This game was a full and satisfying package on its own.  But on top of that, they added drop in and drop out multiplayer, so you can experience on of the best games ever with your friends.  There's an arena mode for pure combat.  AND A GM MODE TO CRAFT YOUR OWN GAMES.  This is huge.  The fact that I can run a Pen and Paper RPG for my friends through a medium such as this opens the floodgates to opportunities normally nonexistent if it was just a normal game of DnD.  It also gives people who host online games the option to give their players the  impression of a more living, breathing world.  The only negative aspect of the game I have experienced are the bugs.  They are few and far between, only amounting to a rare crash, or the voice acting not loading or being delayed.  However, Larian studios are hard at work and have been continually sending out patches to address these issues.  Best game I have EVER played.  I finished the game in 85 hours, doing everything I could along the way, and it's not even $60!    10/10  buy  this  NOW!"
DarkOwl,327,1,0,"December 30, 2017",Recommended,87.4,"I dunno. I enjoyed the first Original Sin more. Something about the setting and direction was more enjoyable. I feel that both suffer from the problem of, unless you figure out (or follow guides) to exploit the crap out of things, it's not a game that rewards general play. This will appeal to some people, but if you aren't super interested in deeply understanding its mechanics, it may not be a good experience.  I got to the temple area, I've explored a bit, but I'm kind of bored. I don't want to deal with the slog that combat is, and I don't much care for the plot. Also, every other fight seems to become an entire screen filled with fire (especially the blackpits).  I'd recommend it I guess... but tbh I've kind of just given up on it and don't have the desire to complete it."

On another note; it's truly amazing that these days it takes private funding to make a high quality gem like divinity 2. The big game developers have taken advantage of the gamer community for far too long by releasing crap after crap unfinished indie turds, and pay to play DLC to boot..

"Assius, God of Booty",107,1,0,January 17,Recommended,108.8,"Wow. Just wow.  To start off, I had no idea this game was, well, this game. I'm in to RPGs like Skyrim, the Witcher, Dragon Age(ish), and fantasy stuff like that. I had always seen this game advertised on steam's front page in recommended for me, but i never took it seriously since it gave me a very ""Diablo 3"" kinda vibe, and that felt too grindy and un-fun for me. But eventually, I finally caved a decided to take a good look at it and felt i should try it out, since I've heard pretty much only good things (see entire review section of this game lmao). Basically, i didn't many expectations starting out.  Holy‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• This game is good. Like really good. Like REALLY, REALLY good. I did not expect to fall in love as much as I did, nor to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing binge the game and end up earning 80 hours played within a week. I believe a testament to this game's quality is how hard i fell for it, even without playing (or even really knowing about) the first Divinity. It's detailed, it's fun, it has a great story, the gameplay is engaging and does not get dull, and the sheer freedom the player has is incredible. The game's dialouge and overall feel gives me a big DnD vibe. There are many, many branches a dialouge, quests, and the story itself can break off into which will seriously affect how you go forward in the game, even affecting the ending in a very critical way, not the ""good"" or ""bad"" ending bs you normally get from choice-based gameplay like Dishonored or Mass Effect. Moreso, the games gives you more freedom in how you want to build your character, not confining people to class, but rather providing a ""skill level"" you must be leveled up to in order to learn certain abilities, which are all fairly low.  I don't have the ability like other people to give you a long review about every little thing, so I'll leave with this: If you are looking for a fantasy RPG that will reward you with a in-depth experience and let you truly craft your character to be exactly who YOU want them to be, then this is the game for you.  Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a calibur of game that belongs with the other incredible RPGs like Skyrim or The Witcher 3, and possibly has the potential to surpass them, in my opinion. 11/10 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing fantastic"

Regina,89,1,0,February 26,Recommended,192.6,"It's been a very, very long time since a game enthralled me like Divinity: Original Sin 2 has. I love a good RPG but they tend to feel like more of the same after you've played enough of them. Not Divinity, though. I found myself unable to turn away right from the get-go, wanting to turn over every single stone, search every crevice before moving on - and I'm sure there's still plenty of secrets I missed. I had over 12 hours logged before I'd even escaped the fortress for the first time.  The gameplay is engaging, the story compelling, the music enchanting, and the world a true work of beauty. I haven't felt this way about a game since I picked up Dungeon Siege off a Walmart shelf back in the early 00's."

Johnford,414,1,0,"September 19, 2017",Recommended,187.2,"Can't stop playing! It's too good! I haven't been this engrossed in a video game since Witcher 3. The various systems of the game are so well crafted, and open up so many possibilities both in terms of combat and how to deal with quests.   The tag system and large dialogue options allow for proper roleplaying. There's a TON of things to do, and none of them are of the ""icon clearing"" variety found in your typical open world GTA/Ubisoft AAA bore.  The writing is very solid, it doesn't take itself too seriously and it's very funny, but deals with serious subjects (racial tension, faith, abuse of power etc...) in a mature way. The music is also seriously underrated.  The graphics are good in terms of the environments, but I guess I'm a not a big fan of the character models. The faces are quite ugly, and the fact that every ""finesse""/rogue armor pieces are baggy pants and sleeves kinda irks me, it doesn't look very light and stealthy. A very minor gripe however, since we don't spend too much times looking are our heroes up close.  I've read that some people have encountered broken quests, and I guess it can be expected at launch given the insane number of them and unlimited possibilities (you can literally kill any NPC, steal any item etc...), but personally the only issue of that kind that I've encountered was just a completed quest (I got the item rewards for it) that didn't clear out from my quest log (The Imprisoned Elf).  I'll just finish by going back to how good and fun the combat is, the interactions between the different elements is a fantastic sandbox to play, and sometimes horribly fail, in. The AI is not exempt from that, I cried laughing last night when an enemy rogue went invisible and promptly revealed himself by falling on his butt after sliding on an ice patch he had created moments before! There are so many builds to be created and ways to approach a fight (including not fighting it at all sometimes, either through dialogue or sneaking/thievery), I can't see myself getting bored anytime soon!  The replayability seems huge as well, since you can have very different questlines depending on who you bring along in your party and who you're playing as your main character.  TLDR:  Fantastic RPG, breathes fresh air into the genre, most fun turn based combat this side of XCom, gives you a ton of freedom and fun with it's system. Serious GOTY contender!  Edited because apparently the word for butt that starts with an A gets censored, by Steam... what?"
deltachi205,175,1,0,"September 20, 2017",Recommended,92.2,First time review here.  Just thought it was time to review a game I enjoyed more than most.  This is honestly my first dive into the hardcore crpg genre and as such I decided to dive in head first.  I have been taking my time to slowly read everything and triple check all areas.  That being said I'm ~20 hours into the game and I'm hooked.  Those 20 hours are over 3 days and I'm still enjoying every second.  Pros:    -Immersive gameplay that introduces you to your party and their backstory  -Voice Acting...simply put EVERY SINGLE LINE is voice acted.  This helped a newcomer like myself really want to hear all the dialogue and enjoy the story unfolding.  -Battle Mechanics...Every battle has a million ways of being approached and with the customization of your party you can take that to even more possibilities   Cons:  Only minor things that are more annoyances than cons...  -Party refuses to walk through status effects outside of combat.  Its nice that they auto walk around these things but the fact that they just won't follow the leader if there is no way around can be frustrating.  -Slower pace out of combat can tend to keep you out of the action longer if you are walking from one side of the map to another.  Nothing major here and honestly I'm reaching to find any cons so far.  TLDR: This is one of the best games I've played in a long timeand I think I've found a new favorite genre.

[RnT]Hank,160,1,0,"November 27, 2017",Recommended,93.7,"78 Hours in, not halfway through 2nd area yet.    Similar to D&D but with its own very unique universe.  Like Baldur's Gate only good.  Pros - Single, Multi, World Builder, DM mode.  Easy, medium, hard and hard +1 save file.  Long game (so far), hard game even on medium.  All NPCs are interactive, all can be killed, most will trade.  All dialogue is voiced, multiplayer dialogue can include input from all players.  Many ways to complete objectives - cleverness is often rewarded.  Looks generic on the surface, but the races are all very unique and a few small changes make for a big difference.  (Example, all elves can eat body parts and gain their memories.  Simple twist, major consequenses.)  Cons - Inventory management is tedious.  Crafting ""discovery"" is stupid, but IMO wikis ruined that for all  games.  There was an instance of me being able to kill and loot the same guy in two different locations on the same campaign - didn't hurt my game much but I guess it was immersion breaking.  There really aren't enough cons here to make a list."

strekalalex84,48,1,0,"December 2, 2017",Recommended,201.2,"The mechanics of the game's system is somewhat similar to Pillars of Eternity, in that your character's stats function in terms of percentages and there is a skill system of sorts that you build from 1 and up. It is an open classless system where, while one selects a few options as a baseline at character creation, one is free to invest in any of a full variety of skills over the course of the character progression. However, it does turn out that, at least from an optimization or min/max perspective, maxing the Warfare skill ends up being the default choice for builds that care about damage. There are a few other potential balance issues with the skills, but that's the big one.   The overall combat difficulty in this game seems to be harder than one has probably come to expect from most new RPG's, even on classic mode (the equivolent of the ""normal"" setting), though things can get easier as one learns and exploits the system. But, especially when approaching it on my first playthrough, I too often found myself putting it on story mode (""easy"") to overcome otherwise tough battles. I dislike doing such a thing in an RPG. It feels cheap, But I found myself doing it. The dual physical and magic defense system is simple and functional, though perhaps it is not the most nuanced or fun basis for combat in the way that it works. Combat becomes a matter of destroying enemy defenses in order to leave the enemy vulnerable to taking damage.   There is an attempt to have a little dialogue depth when talking with companions and important NPC's. I would say the dialogue and roleplay involved in it is okay. Nothing super immersive and detailed, nothing like a Torment game or a Dragon Age: Origins, but it's there more than would be the case in a more pure action RPG. There is some choice and consequence based on certain dialogue choices. Your companions have distinct back-stories and personal goals, and stories of their own that can play out over the course of the game. Further, due to the 4 character party limit, there is a little bit of replayability in terms of playing with different companions.   One of the problems with the game is that there simply is not enough explicit direction for the character to be able to follow or complete quests, since there are no quest markers and not much in the way of detail in the journal. Sometimes this is the case in such a way that breaks certain quests because of timing and choice/consequence issues. In and of itself, I don't object to a lack of quest markers or the idea of having the player have to work for things a little. But while it isn't much of an issue in the early game, by the mid to late game I found myself with a journal half filled with unfinished quests simply because I had no clear idea or memory of exactly where the characters I'm supposed to talk to are, or because I had progressed too far doing other quests and missed a vital quest cue or one-shot oppurtunity.   On a 1-10 scale, I'd give it an 8/10."

Some of them may seem uninspired at first, but as you go along they become more and more complex and, for me, more interesting.  -Graphics, soundtrack, visual arts mostly in the right place. Voice acting isn't terrible but some accents are a bit pushed i should say.   -Some good old dungeon crawler humour, mixed with tactical turn based combat gives a unique feeling, which i find awesome.   -Environmental storytelling, crafting and easy-to-comprehend platforming all add up to the fun.  -Enemies are NOT easy so far. I do hope that the game lets you kick some‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•in the later levels. (In some areas at least)  -User friendly map system and interface.

Kill3r,592,1,0,"November 25, 2017",Recommended,181.8,"I don't usually play Turn Based games; when it comes to RPGs, I'm more of an free actions kind of guy (Gothic, Dragon Age, Witcher etc). However, a colleague told me about Original Sin and I've purchased D:OS EE and had a blast with it. Unfortunately, I arrived late to the party and didn't get a chance to help Larian with their kickstarter for D:OS2, but I did pre-order it (which I almost never do). And I'm glad I did.  The goodThere are some good changes to the first game: - you can choose your companion's class when you recruit them - you can respec your character and your companions at almost any time! - if you respec, you don't lose your learned spells/skills - you now have a skill bar with many slots at the bottom of the screen - summoning, hands-down one of the best class in the game; summons can really turn the tides of battles, especially since they can be infused with different elements - full voice acting (I know EE also has that, but the original D:OS didn't)  The so-soThere are also some changes, let's call them neutral; some I've learned to like, while others not so much: - physical and magic armor: you first have to tear through your opponent's armor before you can apply any CC to them; this bothered me a lot at first, when I didn't have the means to get rid of their armors easily, but, as you gain more skills and spells, it becomes less of a problem; there are still some weird things about this system, like you fight an attack dog and it has physical armor for no reason (I mean, I understand when a human enemy has physical armor because he has a breastplate, but a naked dog?) - you have to spend skill points on Memory, which increases your skill slots; I didn't like this at first, because I'd want to spend my points on other attributes; however, it isn't as bad, as you receive free Memory slots when leveling up at certain levels - Source Points; I still don't like this mechanic as some of the best abilities are now locked behind the need of source; these good abilities already had the disadvantage of using more than 1 Memory Slot, but you also need Source to cast them; of course, you can steal source from enemies or corpses, but enemies can also steal you source - a bit of spoiler ahead: the companions that are not in your party at the end of the first area will die, so you cannot see their storyline for the remainder of that playthrough; in my opinion, this is horrible game design, but I guess it helps with replayability - your party members can leave you permanently late in the game, depending on dialog choices, even though you had a good relationship with them (high attitude) until then; I was shocked when this happened, because I don't understand what the point of companion attitude is - new game modes: PvP and Game Master; I haven't tried these yet, so I don't know if they're good, but they're there - it also comes with a free Map Editor  The badThe game also has some bad parts, of course: - I didn't play it when it launched because I was sure there were going to be bugs. I've waited for a week or two and a few patches and played it without major technical issues (though I did have a 100% crash in an area that had a lot of lava around, but lowering the graphical settings resolved that). - on the gameplay side, as many have pointed out, the last part (Arx) isn't as good as the rest of the game, but it's not really that bad. There are some weird fights with respawning enemies in a certain embassy, but those can be avoided by sneaking. P.S.: When writing this review, I'm just before the last fight, so I'm not sure what that's like.  The uglyRed Prince and the lizard kin. They're ugly AF.  VerdictThis is a must buy for any gamer who likes party-based RPGs."

I typically find top down cRPGs rather boring but this is definitely one of the top 10 games I have ever played. Time will tell where it lands but it is incredibly good.  There are plenty of full reviews out there so read those if you want a general review. Here is what I specifically like about it: Larian loves its players and it shows.  They really do. In DOS2, you can customize this game to make it the game you want to play. For example, I am not a hardcore CRPG guy. I like a more casual experience and I also want to play this with my partner, preferably without having to cash out for a second copy. While that might be difficult for most games in the genre, DOS2 lets us set the difficult to Explorer (which feels perfectly balanced for us) and play coop in split screen. It also allowed us to redo our builds after the first act so that any mistakes made could be adjusted without having to start over again. It also autosaves plenty, so we could easily recover from any mistake.  I could easily see how I could play DOS2 by myself and love that too. Or to play it with 3 friends who really love hardcore games. In fact, this is the closest any videogame has ever come to being a tabletop pen and paper roleplaying game IMHO.  Can't wait for DOS3."

Seemingly endless character options and abilities beg for replay and the inclusion of complex generated characters to role play only make the emersion more delightful. Excellent voice acting and compelling storyline makes this one of the best RPG games I have ever played. Diferent difficuty modes allows for a more casual approach to combat in the easy mode to forcing you to really think how your battle will play out in the hardest mode which does not allow reloading a saved game if all your group dies.  This game hits all the marks and exceeds them. No serious bugs. Appropriate rewards. Meaningful crafting and colorful, tactical game play that rewards thinkers and not point and click mindless fighting. Elements interact and affect combat.  I can't recommend this game enough."

marklane212,48,1,0,"December 4, 2017",Recommended,89.0,"9.5/10 The only thing that this game needs is more content. The story is incedibly immersive and the character creation and development is 2nd to none.  NEW PLAYER ADVICE/TUTORIAL If your starting divinity as a new player, heres some advice before you start running into the game head-on thinking this is skyrim; as you will add to the list of players claiming this game is way too hard on classic mode...   No spoilers here btw.  STARTING THE GAME At the very start of the game you are asked to create your character (sorry, spoiler!). DO NOT RUSH THIS PART OF THE GAME. Before you even look at building a class, or rushing into the game, the classes in the game develop over the course of the game, so your playstyle with said character will also change. This game is very slow and methodical, not unlike a game of chess; you have to plan ahead and think through your actions, there is no timer!  For players that have come from COD, or Diablo etc. this is not hack and slash, so you cant just run in head-on; its like sending your king and queen in to try and kill the pawns as fast as possible. try to think about what will happen each turn, and plan 2 turns ahead.  SAVE OFTEN pretty much self explanatory, but you get jumped a lot, so safe often so that you dont have to retrack the past 10 mins of walking around.  READ EVERYTHING AND SPEAK TO EVERYONE. This is probabally the best piece of information i can supply, and without revealing too much. divinity is about tactics not hack and slash, so speak to as many NPC's as possible and explore every area. this will grant you more experience and access to more items. As the enemies in divinity are all level based, this will allow you to stand on equal footing with them, rather than being 3 levels; wearing a loincloth and wielding a knife on a stick (actual weapon, sorry spoiler!) against a group of 7 decked out enemies all positioned in highground and chokepoints. Also reading enemies weaknesses and levels/armor etc. will help you to control fights better.  YOU DONT HAVE TO GO THAT WAY! Many situations you come up against will look pretty damn scary, especially when you realize the enemies ounumber you, outflank you and outlevel you. This usually means you are underlevelled for the area you are currently in, so go back and complete a few more side quests, or just try taking a different route and coming back to said area (hint, you might not even HAVE to complete that area, but this could mean it holds some good items, and more levels!).  WHAT IF... This is the most important question to be asking yourself during the course of the game, and will mean the difference between winning a fight with 0 Deaths, and losing a fight without killing a single enemy... analyse what you can do, what can happen if you do it, and how your opponent can respond (sorry this is vague, trying not to spoil anything). abuse the terrain and your opponents limitations!  TO CONCLUDE This game is as difficult as you make it, which is why a large group of people find it so difficult, because their game is half complete! turn every area upside down before you move on, as there is probably about 3 quests you missed with 2 levels of xp. And DONT RUSH CHARACTER CREATION! Dont be ashamed if you start a new game after playing for an hour on your first playthrough, i did, because i realised i missed so much and learnt what i was doing wrong. Good luck and take your time!  (spoiler) PS. dont let the cat die...       "
Hexadorus,189,1,0,"December 4, 2017",Recommended,160.7,"I don't write many reviews on Steam, but I just have to say that this is a RPG gem.  The sheer amount of content will keep you occupied for several playthroughs, and the way it handles co-op is exceptional.  Bringing a friend or three along for the ride is so fun, and doesn't feel tacked on; your story will become that much more interesting, and at times hilarious when your friends are calling out for help!  If EA published this game, it would cost you thousands of dollars for this much content, which makes the actual pricetag a steal.  I haven't had this much fun in a top-down Roleplaying game since Baldur's Gate II.  If you're on the fence about buying this game, take it from me that you will be engrossed in the story if you wind up purchasing it.  It does take several hours to get into the swing of things, but after that, you won't be able to put it down."

Anon Ymous,68,1,0,October 21,Recommended,118.6,This is the actual game of the year. My only problems with it are that putting too many mods onto standard edition makes targeting act screwy and your hits will sometimes just go through the enemy or actors will act outside of the turn order. I recommend playing with mods that change the armor and cc systems because if you don't you're strongly incentivized to play a party of 4 of the exact same character. This game is great with friends and pretty good alone. 9/10

There are so many options that it could easily overwhelm a player that has never played an RPG game such as this one. The game rewards you for experimenting so save constantly and don't be afraid to experiment and explore. The game also reminds me a bit of one of my favorite RPGs Dragon Age: Origins.

Skeletor64,17,1,0,January 2,Recommended,147.9,"This is my first review so I'll keep it ""short"" and try to get to the nitty gritty. I bought this game on a whim after seeing a friend of mine had it on his wishlist and couldn't figure out what to get off the store. I wanted something immersive, with serious replay value becuase I (like most people) don't care to drop $40 to $60 on a game you play for 20 hours and never touch agian. Knowing nothing about this series I went ahead and bought it totally blind to what I was in store for, and I'll go on record saying I have ZERO love in my heart for turn-based combat. This game has literally changed the way I feel about turn-based combat. I have never played a game that literally ran off an element I didn't like and still love to play the game, yet I'm drawn back to this title agian and again. In what time I have played it I've barely scratched the surface and I'm constantly wanting to know more. The world is BEYOND immersive, nearly every single NPC has some quest or bit of lore that you can soak up anytime you want, making you run from NPC to NPC trying to figure out the current task or quest you happen to be focusing on at the time. It is not an easy game, but the drive to learn and lose yourself in this world is so great the challenging combat becomes less about a challenge and more about a the actual world itself. I became less driven about the loot as I normally would and was solely driven by want to know more of the story. No game has done that to me since the original God of War. Basically if you want a game that you can totally lose yourself in, this is THE game for you."

OniRaze,49,1,0,February 10,Recommended,115.4,"Okay, after about 84+ hours into this game, you can assume that I really love this game considering the amount of time I put into it, and you're right. I LOVE THIS GAME. Now, I am not a fan of turn-based rpg's, but this one really made me reconsider. The combat in this game just makes you feel that you need to spend A LOT of time thinking about what your next moves will be because one wrong move can potentially destroy your hopes and dreams of winning the battle. You may think i'm exaggerating, but i'm not. This game really makes you use that thing between your ears. For an indie game, this gem is worth the price.  Lets get down to the pros and cons shall we?  Pros/cons (+/-): +Combat is really good. Makes you think. +ALL of the NPCs are voiced and just doesn't present you with a dialogue box with no one speaking. +Narration is godly +Build according to what you want out of your game. There is no godly class (well, there are some), play what you want. +++Free skill/attribute/talent reset +Amazing soundtrack +The ending(s) depend entirely on what choices you make. +You don't need a full party of 4 to progress. I've seen a lot of players do it solo and it's glorious. +Every map is massive and chock-full of secrets to explore +No loading when fast travelling to waypoints and going in/out of dungeons. +Romance. (There's no gender discrimination either) +Moddable. (check nexus mods for more) +Multiplayer! Play with friends, or play with strangers that could potentially destroy your game. your choice. +Caters to casual and hardcore players alike.   -Could use a little bit more character customization. (Not a lot of options to choose from) -Monsters don't respawn. Therefore, no grinding. :( -Some quests are confusing to complete. (Had to consult the wiki on how to do them) +/-Classic difficulty (aka normal) might come as a shock to new players (like me) considering the massive spike in the learning curve of the game. -Needs more rebalancing. Mages have cooldowns that are too long, Melee classes are too OP.  -Needs more skills -Some skills have a very long animation that makes some fights very long. (yes, im talking to you, source vampirism)  Questions people may ask:  Should I buy this at full price? -YES.  Should I wait for a sale to buy this? -Why would you even do that?  Do I have to be MLG to play this? -Nope. ;)  Overall: 10/10 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! "

Its completely awesome in so many ways. The combat, the lore, the sound effects, the skills, the environment, the score, the voice acting.. just head to toe this game is crafted with every detail taken into consideration.  If offers tons of replay value, a nice variety of characters, and so many ways you can approach fights, dialogue, progression.   Its not a hold you hand game.. there are things you will find and things you will miss. It will frustrate you, it will challenge you, and it will provide you a feeling of satisfaction when you win or turn the tide of a fight. It will make you think, it will make you plan and use tactics, it will make you really work on your team and its synergies.   I've already clocked almost 75 hours and haven't gotten too far into Act 2 before I decided to start over now having a better understanding of the game mechanics (this time playing as a lone wolf build).   There simply are too many things in this game that I like to list off here.. as a long time ARPG player I don't tend to spend much time or money with turn-based RPGs, but this game has changed that standpoint for me big time. Its so well thought out, so well designed and is such an intriguing game. Get lost in Rivellon, go explore, talk to everyone, find all the secret loot and solve its many puzzles.   When you leave a game and realize that you're thinking about it when you're not playing about it quite often, you know that its something special. Haven't felt that way about a game in a while!"

Freddy K,117,1,0,"October 13, 2017",Recommended,185.4," Rating; 9.8/10  Seriously engrosing gameplay! It's a blackhole that secretly sucks hours and hours until you realise that you spent 20hrs on the first island - and that's not even half the gameplay.  The story is rich, voice acting believeable, and it allows you to make choices - ones that matter, and ones that don't.  But not only that, the choices can be conflicting, it really forces you to think about decisions and consequences.   So actual features that I really enjoyed working with Character choice - kill them/ steal from them/ distract them and loot their home/ story choice/ choose who you want in your party [or none at all]. Combat is both easy and difficult - easy to understand basics, but every fight with my mages, I ended up standing ontop of cursed fire due to some ill-fated mistake I made. Explore! - so much to explore, rewards for exploring, and little tid-bits of joy in every corner Visuals are amazing - with specific areas having different ambient glows/effects, which can be like night/day For example the graveyard is dark and dreary, then you move several metres outside to the green pasture, and it is suddenly happy and chirpy etc.,, I have to wrap up this review, because I just subscribed to new mods for D:OS2, and want to play them, so here we go!  It's worth every cent! I was dubious at first, turnbased RPGs aren't what I would have said 'my thing', story rich games aren't 'my thing', but D:OS2 ties them in so well, that it's entertaining and just works well.  So many small things that this game brings to the table that are worth attention, but alas - you'll have to check those out yourself.  I have one con about this game; it's hard to play 'the bad guy', in the story. You can be a‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•to people, but the core story doesn't have some ultimate evil badguy option, which was a bit dissapointing as my second playthru as a solo-thief/asssasin means I can't take over the world and make everyone my slave.

Connectivity works as intended.  Character movements are fluid although excruciatingly slow when out of combat.   Throughout the world, there can be clutter (lootable/theft-able) items surrounding NPCs you wish to interact with. A ""are you sure you want to steal this item right near the owner because isometric cameras are ridiculous while in a tent"" feature would be nice. Incredibly frustrating to 'load' a previous save file because I clicked a half milimeter to the left of the NPC only to steal his +5 I don't need this cooking pot because I'm overlevled for it; only to be attacked by every person in the same post code.

The game has a fantastic soundtrack and sound effects, the world models and textures work well to expand the world and the way elements of the game interact often leads to fun interactions (or massive explosions)  I found the game can vary in difficulty although this appeared to be due to my own inexpierience. The only issue that I truly had with the game was the large upload once I finished playing (as of 2017).

Nxmzy,180,1,1,September 15,Recommended,72.6,"AHHHHHHHHH where to start. You are thrust into a world of magic without knowing what to do, but you use something called the HUMAN BRAIN to explore and inspect the world around you talking to every detailed and voice acted character, listening to the smooth Chocolaty voice of the narrator. This is your world, this is your land to trade and kill on or that's what I would say if it was an MMO but THIS GAME GOOOD is what I'm trying to hint at.  The Gist - You start out as a prisoner the lowest of the low (kinda, Prisoner might not be the best word for this) and are shipped off to an island for reasons you need to find out by playing the game. You try to escape and meet whatever your goal is. One thing to note is this game does not hold your hand you have to find out what you want to do or what you want to be.  Combat - The game consists of a turned based D&D styled combat where you have your move and initiative whoever has the highest initiative goes first lowest last etc... There are Spells scrolls abilities and more you can also just attack (melee) It can be very action packed at times where you're at your last heath and the enemy misses giving you one last chance ONLY TO MISS AS WELL there are also huge monsters that can kill you almost instantly in not prepared. [combat 9/10] There are just times when it doesn't work as well though  AI - Brain dead at times but it works, and can also be funny. [ AI 7/10 ]  Story - The story is kinda Celica BUT it works how everything molds together and even better for each main quest there are usually about 10 different ways you can do it or you could just skip it all together (this might only be for the first section the skipping part IDK that yet)  Map(s) - There's about 4 of them and they are each with there own story and problems you can choose to fix or simply just kill them all the people (BTW I tested this and yes you can kill every one IKR AMAZING I LOVE KILLING!!!!!) no people no problem. Every map is diverse and different from the last with different looks and settings which only helps the game to feel EVEN MORE ALIVE. (Maps 10/10) They are all ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ING fantastic love em.  Quest system and shizz - For you to start a quest you must speak to someone who has one right? YAH YEET pick up a sword BOOM you just started a quest pick up a phoenix egg BOOOM you just started.... well I guess ended a quest but hey that's for you to find out. The quest system is pretty regular compared to most quest systems BUT GUESS WHAT there is no back and forth quest EX: Hey you send this letter to queen stupid face so she can send me back and equally useless letter so I can send her back another and another etc... This game Has NON of the thankfully also you can get a quest from animals these Devs were on like weed or something when making this game because some of the quests are AMAZING there was one where I had to kill a chicken. [Quest System and shizz 10/10] amazing overall.  Conclusion - This game is a must buy for D&D players strategy players and also starters it is well optimized and loading is like zipping fast but in some areas, they do throw a lot at you so be wary of that, and if the game is on sale it's even MORE worth it. So it's a Buy. [This Game is a 9/10 With a Badass seal of approval]  Quick shizz:  Cons - Kinda repetitive at times/story can lead you astray in the last part /  Pros - Good combat / Replayable / Great sound design / Awesome music / Good effects or graphics / Gorry / Charm / Fun even if you don't have friends :D (like me ;-; )."

Poor blacksmith decided to start walking as I moved a chest closer in and instantly died :(  So I loaded up here belongings into said chest and headed to the Kitchen and this time VERY carefully moved it close enough to sell everything not needed to those NPC's.

RareLight,93,1,0,September 1,Recommended,64.6,"Divinity Original Sin 2 is one of the best games ever created. It is about creating your own story and crafting your own experience. Characters can die before you even have the chance to meet them, even off-screen, so 2 playthroughs will never be the same. You can take a lot of decisions, be it slaughter a town, make enemies or allies, betray people, steal stuff, mind control them, eat them, absorb their souls, save a dude only to realize he has one hell of a sword and that you want it or decide between killing a dragon, freeing the dragon or breaking his shackles to challenge him to a fair battle to the death and so much more.  The game also features total freedom. You can always respect your character starting from act 2 and there is no class system. Everyone can change their equipments and skills on the go. Mixing certain tree skills allows you to create devastating combos and you can really enjoy watching as your character grows from a nobody to someone that can be praised, hate or feared across the land.  Music is extremly good and you can choose from up to 4 different instruments, each making the battlefield give off a different vibe and enriching your experience. From a calming flute to a intense chello. Graphics are also pretty good for a game of this scale, most areas are detailed and the effect of skills and environments are breath-taking. When you cast a thunder, it sounds and looks realistic, it gives a feeling that it is really going to zap someone's life out of them. Creatures design is also decent, while you might find stuff you had already seen multiple times in other games, there are also some stuff that has never been seen before. Like flesh eating elves that are also plants.  The only faults I find in this game are that it can be pretty hard for newcomers or people who don't play strategic games often, that it could explain some of it's mechanics better or be more detailed in how certain things came to be. But these are all minor complaints for the most part. Do yourself a favor a buy/play this game becuase if you don't you are only missing out on some of the best stuff on Steam.   A tip I would give to everyone who plays this game is to take the ""Pet Talk"" talent. It allows you to speak with animals!( or for them to speak with you) and this gives you access to some of the most funny stuff in the game as well as dead threats, unique situations, some of the most interesting characters and even foretelling of dark lords coming to kill all life on the planet.  5/5.  Would love to hear more about insects dark lords, being roasted by a LV 3 guy with a fire dragon and fighting inmortal trolls that won't allow you to pass through a bridge unless you pay insanes amount of golds."

Skwatch,196,1,0,September 28,Recommended,39.2,"Playing Divinity Original Sin feels very much like playing a Dungeons And Dragons game, and it's also the game it takes most of its inspiration from. It's an easier to understand version of DnD, and I think it is perfectly possible to release a PnP version of the core rules of the game. While these rules aren't really explained in-game, they are very intuitive and it's easy to comprehend what is going on behind combat.  I like Divinity Original Sin 2. It's a little bit different from the first game, but still it feels very fresh and the problems addressed with the first game are now gone.  Differences from the first game One of the biggest differences are now the ""two-type-of-armor-system"". One is physical and the other one magical. Little bit similar as in the Starfinder Pen And Paper RPG, where you got AC for physical damage and EC for Energy Damage. Other differences are balancing of the skills, damage dealing and spells. Also the action points are fixed. Crafting is different too and is now easier. The rock-paper-scissor mini game for conversations is also gone.  Another big difference are two new races, which in the beginning I wasn't really convinced of, but if you play further they fit really well into the story.  The Story The story is also in my opinion better told than in the first one.¬†¬†I'm not a fan of voice acting in general, but this game does it really well, especially since dialogue is mostly text-based and everything is also voice acted. It's very nicely done. So you don't have to listen to the voice actors to know what is coming. You can just read and respond to it faster.  What is good about this game is that the story allows for multiple solutions to certain problems. This can be from ignoring the quest and fight your way through to multiple civil solutions you can do by ""roleplaying"".¬† These solutions aren't always clear and not everything is handed out to you by map markers or highlighted characters. You have to find out most of the stuff yourself.  The first time I played the starter island, I dumbly fought my way out of the prison. But actually on my second try of the game, I already found 4 ways of getting out of the prison. Which made me wonder now... how much stuff I have missed or didn't see the first or even the second time I will play through this game.  Combat Combat is very similar as in DnD. It's turn-based, which is fun. But sometimes also so slow when facing many enemies at once. It can also become very difficult at times. It's not an easy game.  So when combat starts, just as in most turnbased¬†RPG's everybody gets their initiative, based on their initiative score and something else I don't have found out... That determines who gets first in combat. Note that turns always alternate between player and opponent. Your initiative only determines the order of your own characters.  The other difference in divinity from other RPG's¬†is that no matter what, you will almost always do damage. The percentage of missing an attack is very low. I think characters can dodge an attack if they have the appropriate talent or if the attacker simply just missed. When dealing damage, you first have to destroy their respective armor and then you can lower their HP. Which is pretty cool. So you don't have to roll to hit against an armor number, which makes it possible and more fun to attack a higher level enemy with multiple characters. It gives you the sense that your attacks actually do something instead of miss. There is also a chance you do critical damage with each weapon. That percentage is also determined by your wits. And the percentage damage it does extra is determined by the weapon stats itself.  Damage dealt is also more fun than in D&D. You always do minimal damage with certain weapons. So if you have sword and it does between 5-8 damage it would be in DND 1d4+4. There is no way you do only 1 damage, there is no way you can roll bad. Also the damage of weapons and spells increase with your attributes.  Character Creation The damage you do, they hp you have, etc... is based on your attributes. Which is very similar to abilities in D&D. The names are sometimes different, but they work in the same way. The only new one is ""Wits"", it effects your critical chance, initiative and perception.  Next to attributes are abilities. Which are called skills in DnD. These increase characters effectiveness with weapons or allow you to take more skills. There are two kinds of abilities in the game. Combat and Civil abilities. Some help with bartering or sneaking other with damage of certain weapon types.  Then there are skills, which are also are a little bit like skills in D&D. They determine the effectiveness of your spells and weapons. The huge difference is that you can always learn a new skill, thus getting the proficiency with everything related to that skill. So if you want to cast fire spells with a certain character, just give him the pyromania skill. These skills get their bonuses from their respected attributes and scale with level. The weapon related skills scale with the weapons you have.  The skills you can actually do are those you have learned from skill books, which act like the feats from pathfinder or DnD 3.5. You can find those books or buy them from vendors. These are plenty and easy to find and mostly bossfights will reward you with one. The number of skills you can remember are determined by character level.  And then at last you have the talents, which are also a little bit like feats or special abilities in DnD. The talents are passive and give you certain perks. Like talking with animals, or you heal more if you are alone, stuff like that.  Similarities with DnD What also came over from 3.5 DND is that the range and damage of your ranged attacks are higher when having the higher ground. That you can flank enemies and that you can have attacks of opportunity. The different kind of states the characters can be in are also the same: sleepy, diseased, slowed, poisoned and they are also healed in almost the same way. The different kinds of terrain also work the same and make the combat very entertaining because it's a huge part of the game. It's also one of the first basic tricks for every DM in a rpg to make combat interesting by having cool environments.  O, yeah, graphics and stuff... Furthermore, the graphics and sounds are very good. The user interface is very well done with many effects to make it enjoyable to use.  Actually I'm not really into graphics of games and while this game is obviously more demanding and detailed in its graphics and sound in comparison to the first game, I still prefer... the original - not even the definitive edition - of the first game. Because of the more cartoony look. If you know me, my favorite type of graphics are those of the computer games between the years 1998 and 2004. Those were good times.  Only <3 for this game!"

The Guardian Fox,481,1,0,May 1,Recommended,189.5,"So good it will make you question WTF everyone else is spending time and money on when they develop an RPG. It's the best turn-based RPG I've played in a very long time, and one where I actually feel like I'm playing a role. Which is especially good since you all know we can't count on Final Fantasy for that fix anymore.  The Good: Fully voiced campaign, including all NPC's! (Even big budget titles don't do this!) All playable characters are customizable, and able to be used as their own character, including recruited companions. Pick an origin story, or make up your own. Fun, tactical, and innovative combat system. Very Replayable. Moddable, with a custom campaign creator to boot. As if that wasn't enough, it has a D&D style Game Master mode.  The Bad: Persuasion is overpowered. Don't get me wrong, I like having a charming character who can talk their way out of some situations, but it seems like most things in this game have persuasion options, sometimes when it wouldn't even make sense for someone to be convinced otherwise. It requires little effort to make a character to fulfill the necessary requirements, as it's easy to pump your main character full of persuasion and let other characters handle other areas. Sometimes I consider this a great boon to the role-playing side of things, but it also makes for a weaker experience in gameplay. One of the weakest aspects of the game in fact, IMO.  While Larian did an excellent job desiging the areas and leveling, enemy level scaling still doesn't exist. I know some people like those moments where you revisit an earlier part of a level and you can just murder everything, but I prefer every combat encounter to have weight.  I enjoy little moments in games like Elder Scrolls, where NPC's act racist, especially toward non-human races, because it's realistic, helps immersion, and gives you an added cause, with characters and concepts to combat. You want to do your character's race justice, perhaps change opinions, or get vengence. It's good for role playing. But in this game TOO MANY characters are racist. I get that they want to add text that changes based on a character's race but, good land, does everyone hate the lizard-folk? It seems like they do! Even the *animals* slander my main character. It just takes a good, immersive idea too far, and just pushes it to the point of being expected and annoying.  Overall, however, the positives outweigh the negatives by far. This is now one of my favorite games of all time, and I could not recommend it more."

Kudakero,103,1,0,"November 18, 2017",Recommended,156.0,"Just finished this game and I have to say this one of the best RPGs I've ever played. It feels like a D&D game story-wise and the decisions you make can have big consequences. Combat is awesome - complete with terrain variations, elements, and explosions. You control all characters in combat which means you aren't just stuck with one playstyle or character type. If you enjoyed the Dragon Age series this game will definitely pique your interest.  The music is awesome and powerfully sets the mood.  The only negative I really have is the pacing can sometimes be slow. Just go into the game with the understanding that it's going to take awhile if you plan on doing most of the content.   Due to how many plot choices and party choices you can make in a playthrough, I just beat it and am already mapping out my next playthrough!"

Divinity Orginal Sin 2 is a breath of fresh air, the voice acting, the graphics, the character depth, the longlasting but interesting storyline, the freedom, the combat, and the overall complexity/amusement this game brings to you will make your reconsider what really well devloped games should be like.  It cannot be expressed enough on how enjoyable this game truly is, the subtle comedy and the well written diaglogues (with almost all voice acting) makes you cream. It's downright splendid. This game packs 20x as much content without any real DLCs, and depth/effort/time put into this game by the developer that is still cheaper than a AAA title? You've got to be kidding me!

Vinny Vally,205,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,65.5,"Awesome!  So me and 3 of my mates are playing the campaign together - Each of us for the first time so it's all fresh and fun!  Last night we were attacking a group on a balcony which drew aggro from 3 below - There were 2 stairways up to us, one directly and one that went ALL the way around the balcony.  Within a turn or two, two of the guys at the bottom start running up to us. On the close stairway I cast rain and lightning it, stunning the two. After the lightning effect wears off, I oiled a portion of the area and slowed them down. During this time, we finish of most of the enemies up high. The third guy however walked in circles at the bottom seemingly ignoring us...  After a turn or two more, the 2 guys on the stairs reached myself so I teleported one of them back to the bottom to give us some extra time. When I did this, the third guy STILL at the bottom decided to ATTACK his own TEAMMATE to heal himself!! He was on full health!! He just attacked poor Timothy for no reason hahaha!!  Sooooo, a few turns later, the second guy had run back up the stairs and we'd dealt with him and all the others. Just the third guy remaining... He, who obviously wanted no part in this fight, had decided to, for whatever reason, to go up the other stairs and ALLLLLLLL the way around...  So, we decided to set a plan of ambush - Because at this point we were all laughing and just mocking this particular guy anyway - So we all gathered on the balcony that the path led to just around a corner, except for our support guy who stood right at the back of the path.. I set a layer of ice, and some oil, and then we just skipped turns for him to run to us.  Finally, one turn away, JUST around this corner we could see him. I froze the poor guy, and someone else warmed him up just to toy with him. We were all laughing given how long it took for him to get there... HIS TURN!! FINALLY!! We figured we'd let him hit just one of us just because.. But no!! What's this?? He's run past me... And my friend... And another... And then past 2 minions... Where's he going?!?! hahahaha. He ran directly at the support guy but ran out of AP and just stood next to him thinking for a while, then passed his go! Hahahaha!! He'd just about made it around the entire balcony when we finally killed him..  God damn that was funny!! Cannot wait till we're all online tonight :D    Basically the same game as the first but with improvements in skills, choices, graphics, etc. Highly recommended!"

The possibilities of problemsolving to almost everything are huge. And of course its played best with some friends who each have their own main character and own questlines.  This adds a lot to the replay value, not only that all of the six ""origin"" characters have their own unique quest, everyone does their own adventuring if you reach new places and get quest for the group find secrets or loot for himself"

Astroflap,78,1,0,August 31,Recommended,125.9,"TL;DR Buy this game! Best RPG game I've ever played and in my top 3 games of all time without a doubt. There are hundreds of hours of gameplay here. The gameplay is quality unlike games like Skyrim which pretty much relies on mods to be fun for extended play sessions, which this game also offers. Dialog and story is also some of the best you'll find in recent games with  every piece of dialog being voiced which is just a great thing for an Indie game to do.  Seriously 9.9/10 game.  This is honestly the best RPG I have ever played and one of the best games I've played in general. This is one of the few single-player games that I just can't stop playing.   Before I played this game me and my friends played a lot of D&D, but we couldn't find enough time to play as much as we'd like since we were in our final year of school. So for ages I looked for a game that could emulate that same expirence. Being able to do what I want, having funny moments as well as epic. When one of my friends showed me this I was hooked.   The mechanics are almost the exact same as old school table top games, so iif you're into that turn based combat you'll love this, but even someone like me that normally hates those kind of combat mechanics in games I just loved these just because of how polished they were. The combat suprisingly has a lot of depth to it. There's so many different spells and equipment and many of them interact with eachother in their own ways.  The story and dialog is also one of the best I've ever seen in a game. Most of the dialog has so much character and is of such high quality, only of the voices feel as they were acted poorly, but 10000x better than you'll see in any Bethesda game. The fact that all of the dialog in the game is voice acted is also just an amaznig thing. It makes it feel as you're living in a real world and it also helps with the consistancy where some lines would be voiced and some wouldn't. This wouldn't mean anything iff the story wasn't good, which thankfully it isn't. The story is so good. It pulls you emotionally in so many different directions and you have to make so many decisions that make or break relationships and have an effect on what happens for the rest of the game.  Character creation is also pretty good, different races and classes having different traits and abilities as per usual. This part is the only part that I find to be pretty hard on new characters since some races and classes are harder to play than others, which can make it difficult and punishing. This can become a non-issue early in the game since you have the choice to pretty much change everything about you if you're not happy about it.  The one thing that I wish could be different about the game is its modding cababilities. Sadly as of now there aren't any mods anywhere near as big as mods that you find in Bethesda games, but thankfully this isn't a Bethesda game so you don't need mods to make it interesting lmao. This game does have the ability to act as your own Dungeon Master and make a whole game for you, your friends and your fellow steam gamers. and you also have the ability to download other peoples campains which just extends the hundreds of hours in the base game.  This game is almost a perfect example of what a game should be. For the gamer by not constantly trying to ram microtransactions down every hole in your body, have hundreds of high quality content from launch. Constant interaction with the community, THESE GUYS MAKE VLOGS MAN!!! and last but not least they don't do what every triple-a developer is doing now and making all their content and just releasing it as expansions. These guys are just about to release a FREE expansion that adds hundreds of more hours of gameplay which I would be more than happy to pay for since it is actually worth it and it's made to add value to the game instead of be a stupid cash grab.     SO IN SUMMARY. Buy this game, its amazing how an indie studio made on of the best games of recent times from a kickstarter with a reasonably small studio compared to multi-billion dollar companies that make subpar games at best. These people really care about what they create and it shows in their final product. I recommend this game to everyone and I feel like a better person everytime I do so."

N1. NerdetssKi,268,1,0,February 24,Recommended,99.3,"Great game, great engine, fun combat.   Not Quite as good as Pillars of Eternity though. I found myself comparing the 2 a lot during my 100 hour play through of the campaign to the end.  During that play through I spent half my time playing the game and half my time loading quick saves. It might just be how I deal with multiple outcomes in situations but it also came from making constant stupid mistakes. This game really shows you just how smart or dumb you are as a person, or at least makes you feel like a complete idiot so many times.    Part of the reason why Divinity 2 made me feel like a dummy was probably due to how much I had to rely on Google and Game Wiki's to get quests done or to get through situations or puzzles. Too often it felt like the game hadnt given me enough clues or any at all to progress through some situations, and that can be completely on me most the time for being thick in the head, but I found more than a few times that it happened turned out to be something that I would never have discovered no matter how switched on I was. For example theres a moment you have to put a specific framed picture onto a plaque on the ground to unlock a hatch you wouldnt even know was there to continue the story and there was no way of guessing you had to do that and the only clue it gave was so vague that I wouldnt have put 2 and 2 together in a million years. Moments like that made the game as frustrating as it was enjoyable.  Theres something about Pillars of Eternity's flow through the locations and storyline that was just so much more peacful, Immersive and enjoyable for me compared to Divinity 2, but when I compare these games together PoE only just comes out on top against Divinity for the reasons I mentioned above.  I recommend this game, but I must say, before you start, book a week off school or work and turn your phone off, because its all you're going to do until you finish it."

Moustachio'ED,40,1,0,February 25,Recommended,52.1,"The game itself is great and a true continuation and development of all that was loved and praised about the first Original Sin; however, and it's a big however, the engine is buggy as hell.  There's an odd core usage issue which means that multi core cpus are not utilized and the game dumps everything onto a single core - notice the strange frame skip stutter when panning?  That's a core usage issue and nothing else.  It seems the devs either don't care to fix the issue or can't fix the issue, which means one has to set the processor affinity to a single core and then back to all cores in task manager every single time one plays the game.  Not cool.  So if they sort that out, it's a highly recommended game; if not, it's still recommended but be prepared to tune your system every playthrough.

Good story and writing in general Smart enemy AI Animations satisfying to watch Sounds are well done Good music. Not as good as Nier: Automata. But still fairly good. A long game. First run took me ~130 hours, looking through every nook and cranny I could find, reading everything, using no walkthroughs. Tons of replayability. Many different choices, several different races and origin stories with different perspectives. Multiplayer (which I haven't touched yet) Mod support (which I haven't touched yet) Tons of flexibility as far as what your character can become. Many side quests which are well done, Several of which span across acts. Clearly defined ""Point of no return"" points.  Cons: Doesn't hold your hand as much as other games. (Which I personally like, but some people might not.) Balance issues between the classes (Debateable) Noticeable drop in quality in the final act. MIssing voiceovers. One notorious and buggy enemy encounter where weak enemies keep respawning, potentially for hours, with no xp gain. Quests more screwy. One NPC talked to a party member calling them someone else who has never been in the party. Needs patching. (My main complaint) The crafting system largely expects you to experiment. No materials are lost upon a failed combination. But I'm not going to bash things together all day until something works. At the end of the game I was still mostly unsure if most of the stuff I collected had any use. There are anvils and blacksmithing tools, but crafting armor/weapons/food dishes never seemed worth it and were a waste of space. Etc. Inventory system needs to be more user friendly. Like selecting multiple things at once. Or a search function. The storage box needs to be broken down into categories just like your inventory is.  Overall, tons of bang for your buck, which is what I'm all about. 9/10. Would be 10/10 if it wasn't for the issues in the final act."

The only complaint I have at this point is the crafting system, which still seems very cryptic. I presume it will be improved for the final release, but as it stands, I was only able to craft some arrows and potions. The recipes and books I found were all restricted to arrows, potions, and some cooking stuff (the cooking stuff seemed pretty useless up to now). Apart from that, the game looks and plays beautifully. The history is pretty interesting as well and keeps you immersed and hooked for what's coming next. I actually felt a bit sad after beating Act 1 because I want to play the rest of the game so bad, but I know I'll have to wait at least a month until it gets released. In conclusion, if you played DOS1, you have to play this game. If you're new to the series and enjoy very well designed turn-based RPGs, with challenging fights and a myriad of different skills and spell combinations to choose from, then you also have to play it."

Roadie,207,1,0,September 10,Recommended,245.1,"Divinity: OS 2 takes the base of the first game, that is already considered one of the best CPRGs out there, and revises it's battle and stats system to be even better. It removes the randomness of the first game and instead adds armour system, that shifts the game more towards strategy focused on disabling enemies and keeping your armour up as well as using several different added little advantages throughout the battlefield. All these changes make honour (hardcore) mode entirely possible  and extreemly satisfying to beat even for casual players on second of third playthrough. The game also contains a good amount of books, that can fill out newcomers to the series on the story of all the previous games. Overall i highly recomend this game to everyone, but also advise to play Divinity: OS 1 first because playing it after the this game feels realy weird."

Natebody,10,1,0,"September 4, 2017",Recommended,165.3,"Early Access Review:   Original Sin 2 is what exactly what every RPG gamer has been looking for - there's a potency to its' immersion that every EA title should aim to hit. This is the caliber of gaming you (EA devs) should truly attempt to employ!!!! It's an absolute masterpiece of Early Access gaming. A true game of D&D mixed with chess.......Larian said they posted this game on steam with a laugh, and I know why!! Ok I'll stop with the hype and explain.   (Graphics, optimization, controls, gameplay, sound.)   Graphics/Animations: 10/10  Right from the jump you notice how polished the world and characters look. From beautiful landscapes to fluid animations, I love it!!!! Nothing left to say here! Excellent job!   Optimization: 10/10  No loading screens.. LIKE EVER during your gaming experience! Excellent work!   Controls: 9/10  No complaints other than the restriction of your camera angles. Part of the experience is viewing a gorgeous and artistic world... You can never look at the sky....and view your character from better angles.. sad. Although, you can rebind your keys, you can rotate and zoom in - You feel like you're in control. Great job!   Gameplay: 9.5/10  This is where the bulk of the game lies. From story to combat - the immersion starts with the world appearance and story narrative, then ends with a blast with its' combat delivery. The combat is spaced out making you feel like you're not always in a chat box, and you'll be satisfied in casting, buffing or even simple melee attacks.  You can be whatever you want to be. Unless you want to be an orc...you can't be an orc - BUT what you can do from what they have to offer makes you feel like you're totally in control of your character's person.   Yes, customization is quite limited. I like my rpgs to let me customize my character to the ""T"" ... and this does limit you in that aspect to a certain extent...better than most games but coming from MMOs you may be disappointed. Given a more customizable character and maybe even adding a few other races .. you'll never play the same character again. Character creation is key in this type of genre - still ... Excellent work!   Music/Sound: 9.5/10  The sound and music is fantastic! ... I'd still love to hear a larger variety of music during gameplay...This will probably end up being a 10 simply because they will add voice acting and more music throughout the future acts. Excellent job!   Overall: 10/10  The story, the adventure, the combat, the scenery, the ..... oh you get it already!!!! What a phenomonal game. RPG lovers, MMO lovers...hack'n'slash lovers... VIDEO GAME LOVERS! You'll love this. I wouldn't post my first review on steam if I didn't believe this to be a game for everyone on steam. Do enjoy! Thanks Larian!"

xace,56,1,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,65.8,"One of the best games I have ever played.  Several bugs and lack of features make it fall just short of that #1 however.  My main concerns are in multiplayer. You have to play as the hosts party characters and not your own. That means playing an archer with a level 2 bow, all stats in wits and other useless talents. There is also an endless amount of bugs with multiplayer. For example, if I am host and start a multiplayer and someone joins me as say The Red Prince and I save, restart whatever, that character then becomes bugged. Instead of reverting back to The Red Prince after that player leaves, he bears that persons name and is unable to be reset, or even dismissed. You normally can talk to npc's in your party and say you want to go your seperate ways and recruit another party member, nope. bugged.  Another example is I use one of my npc's for dialect options since they have persuasion stats and my main is undead. Someone joined the game and took control of MY character and when I leveled up he butchered his stats and skills and those remained on my character after I kicked him and / or restarted the game.  These things make multiplayer extremely frustrating and have forced me to start brand new games probably about 6 times now. I haven't even been able to get through act 1. I am very wary to play in multiplayer due to all these reasons and despite preferring multiplayer in it's theory am forced to play single player to avoid game breaking bugs like those i mentioned. I wish I could provide some feedback or get some kind of bug fix on this bug I don't see an option for that. Thankfully the developer is very involved in the game and will probably fix this at some point. I am now hoping that a user created mod will fix many of these issues in the future (thank god this game has mods)  Despite all my frustrations this game is absolutely incredible in every other aspect. Everything is voiced, every npc which is amazing. Graphics are good (not great) especially for this type of game. Quests are actually fun and not all fetch they actually have lore. There is an absolute freedom: you can kill every npc and still proceed with the game. The gameplay is some of the best ever. This genre has been ruined in the past decade with games like the Final Fantasy series dropping the traditional turn-based combat for an active combat. Yeah, thats nice in some circumstances but it is extremely boring hacking and slashing repetitively just like every other game. The combat in D:OS2 is calculated, and detailed. Everything is listed and heavily focused on strategy and statuses. The game encourages using environments such as high ground and environmentals like barrels and puddles in order to gain favor in battle.   The best part of the game is the fact it's challenging. The default difficulty will probably be too hard for average gamers and those not familiar with the genre or the first game. There are two higher difficulties on top of that which are extremely challenging (I normally play on the highest difficulty in every other game) The next best thing would be that the developers aren't EA, Ubisoft, Activision, etc and force paywalls on an incomplete game and don't support the game after launch. This dev actually cares and I have personally downloaded atleast one patch per day and they have already stated that they are going to implement being able to use your own character in multiplayer which is something I look forward to. Can't wait to see what's next for this game."

UKLonar,209,1,0,"November 9, 2017",Recommended,83.5,"I'd absolutely recommend picking this game up. It's a masterpiece of the modern age, with a classic-styled twist.  Although difficult at times, you can usually figure out a method of beating fights. Despite what some people are saying, the game isn't too hard. There are so many builds/skills you can choose from and many many sidequests to get gear and level up; better preparing you for the difficult fights. You also don't need to go online and look for ""Cookie cutter"" builds. So don't let people put you off!  Although, get used to ""Savescumming"" whilst you learn encounters.  I'm not well versed with CRPG's so I was hesitant to pick this game up initially.  However, I'd now recommend it to anyone who enjoys RPGs.  I'll be running through my second-playthrough soon, as I know I've missed a fair bit!  Give it a chance, you won't regret it! "

Ark,353,1,0,"September 14, 2017",Recommended,133.8,"Words cannot fully describe how wonderful the game is. After 106 hours I have finally finished it on tactician difficulty - the second highest out of 4 difficulty levels - and it's been one hell of a ride. In the pool of games that have filled the cRPG genre over time some are remembered for the gems that they are. This game truly deserves a place among those stars.    Short and quick: The best aspects The combat offers a huge variety of possibilites. 200+ spells allow you to build your character exactly to your liking. They aren't all magical, they don't all scale with intelligence like you'd expect from classical RPGs meaning you can mix a lot of combinations on your character. Don't think of spells as a 'magician only' thing. Every character will use a wide variety and it feels amazing to have this much choice in battle.  The AI will use insane combinations and synergies of spells just as much as you do. They will sacrifice their own if it gives them an advantage, they will use the environment against you.   No ridiculous RNG: Although dicerolls aren't completely banished out of the game these mechanics never feel unfair like in some other RPGs. Games based on pen & paper tend to use a lot of dicerolls but here you'll find that most mechanics have been modified to be very clear about how they work without relying on RNG. Doesn't mean critical attacks aren't possible if you want to play that way ;-)  There are no classes. Don't get mistaken by the character creation, it's only meant to be a help for the early game. You level and can spent your points on the different schools of sorcery. You're never restricted because of a 'class' and after leaving the first area you can fully respecc at any time. You can truly built your character the way you want to.  The worldbuilding is amazing. There is so much to explore, so many NPCs to talk to and stories to experience.  The characters - from simple animals to essential NPCs - are just as amazingly written as the world. Some you'll love, some you'll laugh about, some you'll hate, but never will you think they are acting out of character.   The choice is always yours. One moment you're a saint, next moment you decide an NPC isn't worth keeping alive. Although sometimes limited, there are always consequences.   To further strengthen the last point: You can play the game anyway you want and never hit a roadblock in the story. Even if you murder every NPC you see you'll be able to finish the story.   Play the entire campaign with up to 4 players. 'nuff said  The voiceacting is phenomenal. Everything in this game is voiced, including the narrator. Not only that, but the variety in voices is so large you will rarely - if ever - notice two voices sounding alike. Every unimportant guard, every NPC without a name, every animal in the wild, every character - no matter how essential they are to the story - sounds different and they manage to bring the emotions their words carry to life.  The soundtrack manages to describe the atmosphere in a wonderful way.   Although the story is rather serious, the little sprinkles of humor every now and then shine brightly.  Short and quick: The worst aspects The companions sidequests are wonderful and they influence the main story quite a lot. But everywhere else they're a little pale as they rarely voice their oppinion on what you do during the rest of the journey.   This game can easily overwhelm you. If you're familiar with the cRPG gerne you'd expect this but everyone else be warned: This is not a game you finish in a couple of hours nor is it a linear game. Having a huge freedom means your questlog will burst at times.  The difficulty is real. Even on classic - the normal mode - you'll get your‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•handed to you on a silver plater. I finished the game in 106 hours on tactician - one difficulty above classic - and my save game told me I was 'alive' for 80 hours. That means I had 26 hours of reloading because of party wipes or decisions that I regreted. I thoroughly enjoyed the difficulty but be warned: It's not to be taken lightly.   A slight negative about undeads: If you play one or have one in your party you can chose to hide your undeadness and the story will acknowledge this but the combat won't. I assume it's done for the sake of difficulty and interesting gameplay, but enemies will always know that you're an undead and chose tactics that work against undeads like e.g. hurting you with healing magic.  After all is said, it's still a cRPG. There's a lot to read, a lot of sidequests to do and a lot of possibilites in how you tailor the story around you. Don't go into this game with wrong expectations. It's huge. Having wrong expectations can easily ruin the experience for you.  You might wonder even with all the high praise you've heard about this game how it compares to the best of the cRPG genre. It's not simple to answer this as classics like Baldur's Gate can be hard to enjoy these days. Some of the most defining games of this genre came out in the late 90's to early 00's after all. Divinity: Original Sin 2 takes the things that made those classics wonderful and wraps them into a modern engine. It learned from all the mistakes that happened with the first 'Original Sin' game and improved greatly on them. So in summary, I can wholeheartedly recommend this game. For me it's not only the RPG of the year, it's a strong contender for game of the year."

DarthGrignr,154,1,0,March 1,Recommended,138.9,I bought this game on a whim because I saw that I could finally be a skeleton in an RPG.  What I got was so much more than that.

Jule Damn,37,1,0,March 2,Recommended,44.3,"I played part the Divinity Original Sin Enhanced Edition and enjoyed that, so I decided to get DOS 2 after I saw it on sale for a modest 10% (also because my friends had the game and I wanted to play with them).   As it turns out, this game is such an improvement on the first game that I just cant go back to DOSEE. Divinity: Original Sin 2 is an amazing game that quite literally builds on every positive element of the Enhanced Edition and makes the game so much smoother and comprehensive.   YOU CAN NOW ACCESS ALL INVENTORIES OF YOUR PARTY MEMBERS IN ONE WINDOW. PRAISE LARIAN STUDIOS. Improvements were also made to many mechanics such as: Crafting, purchasing/bartering, targeting AOE spells.  The storyline is also so much more rich now that you have 5 preset characters to choose from (and the option to create your own). Right off the bat, I was much more engaged in DOS2's story than I ever was in the EE. I love their banter. I love that ALL party members can engage in dialogue, thus giving you multiple opportunities to get the ""right"" answers without needing to reload the game. The voice acting is great and the characters have personalities true to their plights.   If you enjoy story-rich games, this one's for you! (If the turn-based combat system deters you, there is the option to play the game in Explorer Mode to make the combat easier and thus a secondary feature).  TL;DR: This game is lots of fun! Kudos to a development team that listens to its community in order to improve on previous iterations of its game(s)!"

Gilmez,113,1,0,"October 10, 2017",Recommended,217.3,"THE STORY: This is by far the most densely rich lore I‚Äôve played through from any game I‚Äôve played, where almost everyone and everything is connected in one way or another. Creating a living and breathing world, where one‚Äôs actions and decisions will affect their adventures through Rivellon. The part where this game shines the most, is how it gives the player choices on how they want to advance the story in any way the player chooses to play. Choose to be good, evil, just or whatever mood you choose, this game adapts to it and guides you to the end that your choices led to. While I‚Äôve only completed Fane‚Äôs Story (in the moment of writing this), the endings it gives you will satisfy however you played. While you can choose how your adventure ends, the game lets you know how those actions will affect Rivellon in the future. The reason why I love this story is how grim and real this story plays out, no one is truly good or evil, it‚Äôs all a grey area, but it‚Äôs your choice on how you want to navigate in it.  THE COMBAT: There was never a dull moment every time I went into battle, or stumble on to one. While combat is turn-based, pre-battle is when things become interesting. Some approaches I found to be more fun is laying out traps and pre-emptive attacks on unknowing enemies. I can go into combat with my enemies clinging on 5% health and wipe them out with one attack. This is true liberty that this game gives to players, it gives you the tools and it‚Äôs up to you on how to use them. And this is just combat, skills can give a creative twist to combat. You can chain attacks to deliver devastating blows to your enemies or toy around with them by unleashing various Statues Effects and skills that can either immobilize them or transform them into chickens. All this creates a simple yet complex toy box you can play with. Finding out what seems fun and effective will make you want to seek out the next battle and unleash your battle plan.  THE MUSIC: I do not, in any way, have any complaints or criticisms about the music. The only thing I can say is that it is Divine. The music makes Rivellon and in turn makes you believe that it is a real place and these characters who live in it are part of a giant play. The 4 instruments that you can pick (while you build your character) creates the mood in how you want to play and you can change it any time you want.  This is the best RPG for this generation. While there are quite a few bugs the developer needs to fix, this doesn‚Äôt affect how much I love this game. "

Oberain,583,1,0,"September 27, 2017",Recommended,170.0,"I'm going to be honest here; I didn't like the first Original Sin.  I found the combat surprisingly clunky, the ""two protagonist"" playstyle akin to mashing action figures together as a child and the NPCs bland and empty.  Just everything about it wasn't as good as the raving crowds claimed.    This?  This is amazing.  This is so far one of my favorite PC RPGs I've ever played...and I'm old enough to remember the original Ultima and Gold Box DnD games.  Most areas and quests have multiple solutions and you're not really punished for taking one over the other.  There are a few areas where lockpicking is basically required but besides that stealth, conversation or brute force are typically viable options to dealing with a problem.  Combat feels tactical (something most RPGs frankly don't really do anymore) with your choices in positioning, abilities and terrain manipulation meaning the difference between victory or defeat more often than just pure stats.  With careful planning you can beat groups of enemies better geared and higher levels than you, though it's still unlikely as one lucky crit can one shot a character.  There are very few mindless ""throw away"" battles once you leave the tutorial island.  Almost every encounter will be an actual fight for your life.  There are some areas the game can be improved further.  While your companions will pipe up more and put more of their character on display than the original, it's not quite enough.  The process in which it happens is sterile and lacks organic interaction.   Instead of the NPCs talking as if the other NPCs were standing around them, they spout their one line and that's it.  If, say, the Red Prince spoke to Fane or Sebille during the journey it would go a long way to viewing them as characters instead of interchangable henchmen that happened to have a  bit of backstory or a sidequest attached. So yes, as much as people like to‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•on Bioware...this could benefit by being more like Bioware in that regard.  Another complaint is I never feel like I'm at the point I'm supposed to be at with gear.  I consistantly feel like I'm a few levels behind with my armor and health offering a totally negligable amount of protection with some enemies wiping my party before I even get a turn.  I don't even know how the game can really ""fix"" this other than perhaps tossing in an NPC somewhere explaining that each level gives shops DRAMATICALLY better gear and the difference between level 10 and level 12 is roughly 150% increase in defense.   Oh and do ignore the publications out there that act like plaiyng Undead is sooo hard.  You literally NEVER have a reason to not be in full armor and you can easily heal from poison damage and poison potions.  It's really not a challenge at all.  Edit and Addtions:  I had originally complained at some poor coding regarding playing a non-origin character and how playing an undead PC made the game think you were Fane leading to some broken quests and ridiculous immersion breaking dialogue.  It seems since launch most of these issues have been patched and some major story moments have been reworked.  It's disappointing they were in the game at all as I can't fathom why anyone would WANT to play as an ""origin"" companion instead of a real character and why playing a real character would end up being so buggy but...that's just me."
Behemoth,662,1,0,"October 3, 2017",Recommended,46.6,"A truly incredible CRPG. The best modernization of the genre that has yet been made.  So many options. I've started over three times and I'm not even halfway through the game. Much better combat balance than the first game, every encounter feels unique in some way. Better designed in general, feels more directed, and has better writing and more interesting characters.  Just fantastic overall. Even if you've never played the series before, pick this one up!"

Kirikitomi,25,1,0,October 31,Recommended,264.1,"I'm the type of person that will flat out stop playing a game if the story fails to engage me. With Divinity 2, the Story was interesting and I felt like there was a lot to be said for being able to approach the game as a character I design vs. one of the compelling Origin characters.  Origin Characters/Companions. Not every companion/Origin is created equal; yes, some companions generally are better than others. Some may have a personality that some individuals find intolerable. But. Unlike many games, your companions classes are completely customizable. You aren't stuck leaving behind a person you enjoy having in your party because their ability tree is junk. That feature alone, is worthy of praise.   Crafting: Most games I play have stupid crafting systems. Divinity 2 is no exception, but you can ignore it for the most part, except in the case of creating a few quest items. It is not the worst system, but neither do I find it particularly enjoyable. It's there if you want it, but don't expect to craft some badass weapons without dling a bunch of mods.  The story itself, in my opinion, is superior to it's predecessor. The Lore felt accessible, rather than confusing and off-putting. The romance system seemed rather nice. Keeping in mind that I've only followed the paths of Ifan, Lohse, and Sebille, I can certify that those three were all satisfying, but in very different ways. I've read that the other ones leave something to be desired, but I can say that the romance doesn't make me want to roll my eyes nor experience disappointment,   The turn-based combat enables an individual to strategize and play to the strengths of their charactersl  I could write more, but I will say that I put off purchasing this game for a year because Divinity Original Sin 1 was okay, maybe even good, but it wasn't memorable to me. Divinity Original Sin 2 broke free of that mould of mediocrity and left an impression with me that has firmly snared a memorable top five games that I've played in my life.   Take from this what you will!"

Divinity: Original Sin 2 is not just a distraction. Assuming it was just that marked my grade's fate.  It's a masterpiece of a game. A true storybook in a sense. It's something that will envelope you into a world of its own and keep you there for hours on end. Should you buy this game?

AtomicTampon,87,1,1,September 5,Recommended,168.4,"Quick review on the only thing ive seen complained about in reviews  The armor system... few bad reviews on this armor system might scare off potential buyers so ill throw this bit out there. because EVERYONE should try this game if they like RPG's, its amazing.  All the armor system really does is take away ""easy mode"", you cant really cast a bunch of CC 5 feet before engaging battle so your enemies are all goofed up and unable to move before turn 1. (something ill admit to doing a lot in Div1)  Example (you see 4 archers in the distance), you make it rain on them, blast lightning into it, they all get stunned and cant move and then you engage the 4 archers causing enemy lose their entire first turn... potentially second too. Personally i found it to be a little cheesy and im glad the armor system was added to circumvent this tactic of ""easy win"".   Now you gotta strip the armor before CC will work, and to those who wanna play heavy CC toon, Make sure you have lower initiative than your party so they can strip the armor before your up to bat with the CC.   Now quit reading this and buy this game! you wont regret it.... And if you do some how regret it, seek phycological help because its YOU not the game :D"
A b h a o t h,189,1,0,August 29,Recommended,129.3,"If you enjoy tactics, deep story with a character that truly feels like a part of the world, this games for you. I have a pretty heavy D&D background and admittedly I don't know how much closer a game could replicate that style of fun in a more traditional 3rd person rpg. It certainly isn't for the faint of heart though, this game will force you to concoct at least a few strategies more than smack it with sword. The multiplayer is smooth, and the dialogue prompts between characters, custom or not, really nail home that ""part of this world"" vibe. Seriously, give it a shot. I promise you'll find yourself looking at so many juicy plot hooks that side quests become as attractive as the main quest."
Emmie,93,1,0,August 29,Recommended,"1,078.3","Divinity Original Sin 2 (original release) is somewhat skeletal overall yet puts forth content that is top tier. The developers obviously poured their hearts and souls into this game and it shows. The one element that holds me back from claiming it as my favorite game is that there are too many gaps. Why am I able to wipe out an entire Island's population before I disembark to a new land? The punishment is insignificant for doing so. Some stories seem to have a fabulous background yet it remains a facade of sorts. With the new edition coming out presently, I think a lot of the issues will be resolved and new content will breathe new life into this amazing game. I will say it again; the developers really put their hearts into this game and it is obvious that they are talented artists and designers."

Deltarizon,104,1,0,April 6,Recommended,175.3,"Well lets start off with a brief description of the game. You're a captive on a ship, a Sourceror, one of the most hated people across the land. Your foul magic attracts monstrosities known as the Voidwoken, nightmares from another dimension that seek to claim this world as their own. However, things quickly roll out of hand, and it ends with the ships destruction. Finding yourself on the prison island known as Fort Joy, you discover that you're no ordinary Sourceror; you have the potential to become a GOD. From there, the game plays out quite literally as YOU choose it, be it as a benevolent hero seeking to save the world or as a malicious villain who seeks to gain ultimate power. And, just maybe, you'll find an option that no one else expected, one that takes you through the Void itself... and finding power that scoffs at the Gods themselves.  As you can probably tell, there's a lot of choices to be made in Divinity 2 : Original Sin, and maybe you're thinking ""Oh god, it's another one of these games that plays out as a visual novel instead of a rpg"". Well if you are thinking that, shut the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• up, strap in, and read up ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• because there's quite a bit more to the game than that.   Now, the best part about this game is it's combat system and character progression; there are few other games where I can actually feel the progression of my character and the impact it has on the world around me. For example, in my very first TRUE playthrough of the game, 100% it, I did it with just two characters, both of them basically assassins; it was hard at first of course, but by the end of the game I could clear a room of 12 heavily armored characters with 2 characters and taking no damage. It truly felt powerful, and is one of my favorite gaming playthroughs of all time. So I thought, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• it, lets try a magical playthrough, might not be as fun as the first, but we'll get through it. Well. Lets just say a full elementalist party is quite a unique experience. The whole 4 person party felt powerful the entire game, and we destroyed everything in sight that we deemed ""Unholy"" or ""Unclean"". Felt ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•ing hilarious the entire way through, and I don't regret a moment of it. For my thrid play through, I went in with a full melee team, and got the exact same results, which has blown me out of the water and clear into the sky; the fact that no matter what kind of team you play you know you'll become a force to be reckoned with is fantastic, and lets you cook up some pretty kooky team compilations. If you don't believe me, go on youtube and look up some of the SOLO builds people can make; they play on the highest difficulty and can quite literally nuke entire areas with a single character. But I digress, that's a bit off topic, and not relevant to this review. So if you've ever felt let down by a characters power or capability, trust me, you won't feel that with this game.  Let's talk diversity for a quick second here. There are 4 main races in the world, the Dwarves, Humans, Elves, and Lizards. Each race has its own unique capabilities, and it's own racial traits, meaning that yes, while you can have a Lizard assassin, making it a human so it have bonus initiative (how soon it gets to move in combat) and extra critical chance (random extra damage) means you'll have an easier time. Or maybe you'll choose a lizard for your geomancer because you have the innate ability to breath fire, and ignite your oil based abilities. A dwarven Inquisitor stands ready to rush into your opponents because they have extra defenses against all forms of damage. And maybe your necromancer is an elf because elves can eat parts of their enemies to learn memories and skills they'd normally never obtain. No matter what it is, you'll find tons of combinations based off of race alone to make a unique and fun character. But is that where it stops? Nope, that's where we're just getting started. See, there is a unique twist you can put on a character; you can make them UNDEAD. Yes, that's right, a skeleton that walks and talks, and which offers other unique pros and cons. For example, an undead character will heal when poisoned, and take damage when healed normally. Skeletons can use their bony fingers as infinite use lockpicks. And most importantly, Skeletons don't have any nasty organs to inhale Deathfog, an uncommon terrain in the game which kills anything that breaths it, meaning that Undead are free to wander through it as they please. The only real downside is having to wear a headpiece at all times. (Which isn't even a downside, like, why would you decide to not wear an important piece of equipment?) But lets say you dislike making all of that troublsome character stuff, you just want to get in and have fun. Well, there are already a ton of premade characters with their own stories and quests to go on if you so choose! There's literally no way to go wrong with making a character in this game!  Hey, we almost missed the most important part of the game, the part where you become a god and stuff! Well friendo, that's what I saved for last because that‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•is called SPOILERS, and I know that some people dislike those. So let it be said now that if you don't want to read any spoilers WHATSOEVER, then you should skip the next paragraph. Cool? Cool.  So as your character progresses through the game, they will discover the ability to use Source to fuel abilities. These are their godly powers, and are only usable by player characters and certain other npcs. This includes the abilites; Bless : Buffs an ally and clears any and all curses that afflict them. Spirit Vision : Is actually free to cast, and lets you temporarily see into the spirit realm, where you can see parts of the past, and even talk with the dead to gain their wisdom. (Or even just to taunt an enemy who bugged you.) Devour : Not it's actual name, but I don't use it often enough to remember it. It's also free to cast. You basically target an enemy corpse (or even just directly target their ghost.) and devour their essence, regaining a source point. Doing this too many times however can mark you with the ""Villain"" tag, which is not what you want to have on you if you're roleplaying as a benevolent hero. Gate : Again, isn't the true spell name, but works the same as the D&D version, creating a permanent link to another location within range that anyone can go through at any time. It sounds kind of dumb at first, but it lets you pull off some pretty wacky stunts in the game, and I've taken it on every character I've made so far. There are of course tons of other abilities that can be fueled by source points, far too many to list them all here, as each class has a few ""Ultimate"" abilities that you need source to use. But if you're interested in learning more about these godlike powers, then just look up a class guide and check out their abilities to get an idea of what you can work with!  Alright, well I think that if you've read everything I've said so far, that you'll get the idea I'm trying to tell you. The game's fantastic, and fun to play, especially with friends. One of the best campaigns we had was one where the entire party split up and fought to become the ultimate character. So if you enjoy shennanigans like that, and you love the sound of this game, then take a go at it! I really think that you'll enjoy the hell out of it!"

Certain issues exist, but they're mostly related to design philosophies. So far we've only encountered some minor cosmetic bugs. The type that get fixed when you do a simple reload.  Examples of replay value include:  -Vast increase in difficulty between normal and hard mode. -You can make crazy character builds on Easy and Normal, while focusing on a challenge in Hard. -Permadeath mode. -Playable Undead characters who heal from poison and get damaged by regular heals. -Lone Wolf talent that changes the way you play, makes you stronger but lowers your party size. -A fast and simple mod on the Workshop lets you increase the party size from 4 to 6 or 7. -Potentially even more mods."

There are kings and queens and emperors, and monsters and villains and heros and gods, and things going on over here and over there while I'm doing my thing.  Most current RPGs make it really hard for me to imagine myself as taking part in the story. For DOS2, it takes almost no effort. I really want to know what happened to my characters ancestors, and what my friend wants to do, and what their family is doing, etc. I can make decisions based on how I would react in each situation.  And on top of all of that, they have coop too! Like WTF, they don't know when to stop!  It really feels like a labor of love.

Rafahell,137,1,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,120.0,"Well, lets put like this...u can play as a Undying (not undead) Eternal (a skeleton), Rip dead peoples face off (in a ecologic way, wait them to die of natural causes(ish)) and use it as a mask so u can talk to childrens without them going crasy...and u still one of the most decent ""people"" in the game =o)  9/10 "

Mikaz,70,1,1,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,132.3,Captivating environments. Detailed Storyline. Make decisions carefully! It may cost you!  Please give this outstanding game an award. It always has me coming back for more!
Luwe,97,1,0,"September 30, 2017",Recommended,108.4,One of the best RPGs ever made.
kambiing,68,1,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,48.0,"Thought when its still on early access : Well this is neat. *look up youtube* wow undead race. I'll stick with this.  So.. after about 30 hour. I do not think i have completed 30% of the game, and honestly I cheated here and there for the parts i find tedious on the story mode, playing by myself, even then i still find the combat exciting.   To sum it up: 1. Core content is solid. Better story than dos1IMO 2. Mod support and multiplayer modes modes. with this much player base. Some good workshop content bound to happen. 3. If you like DOS 1 or any other similiar games (eg. baldurs gate), go get it. Worth every penny."

Soldier4Christ83,96,1,0,"October 7, 2017",Recommended,107.6,"Awesome game!! Lots of Characters, multiple ways to beat all missions, new and interesting ways to craft your characters. Just fantastic!!! I really didn't like the first one as much as I wanted to; the storyline was too silly and it just felt like an offline MMORPG. The storyline is so much more engaging this time around. I hope future developers emulate this game. I love the origin system reminds me of the original Dragon Age, before it went so political, and emo."
Fredamabob,360,1,0,"September 17, 2017",Recommended,96.1,"This game is simply amazing. If you enjoyed classics like Baldur's Gate, or even newer titles like Obsidian's Pillars of Eternity (or Larian's previous installment in the series), this game is definitely for you. It's table-top RPGs brought to it's almost logical conclusion. Excellent writing and gameplay. I fully recommend this game. 10/10."
